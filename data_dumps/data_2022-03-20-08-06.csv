When something is free, it falls in one of these categories:

1. It's a charity, scholarship, or something like it. Free things from this method are given for a specific reason, so if you aren't aware of exactly why *you in particular* are a recipient - then it's **not** this category. 

2. The price of the item is baked into other costs, and they give it away for ""free"" as a publicity ploy. You could charge $10 for an item, then a $3 delivery fee. If 10 people order, and 5 of those get it delivered, you get $115. **Or....** charge $13 for the item, and give free delivery. You end up with $130. People think they're getting a deal by getting free delivery, not realizing they are paying for the delivery even if they don't use it.

There are usually not many free seats outside the gate when I get there, so if I’m trying to get some work done or if I have food with me, boarding let’s me perch down (almost) uninterrupted.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1647779690.0,17

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

When I saw that painting in an art book, When I first saw that, I don't know how to put it, um this is a bit dirty, but I got a boner. I just cut out the part with her hands and hung it in my room for a while. I want to cut off yours, too. My name is Yoshikage Kira. I've killed 48 women with beautiful hands up to now.

I will never understand the obsession that grown adults have over what a newborn baby's penis looks like. I just don't know how you could look at this new little life you created in its truest form, that nature/biology intended, and immediately want to start altering their body. I find it so disgusting that this is still a common practice and people truly believe they are doing what's best. There hasnt been any medical findings that can confirm circumsizing is more beneficial, let alone even necessary. Saying that it keeps the penis clean is a poor excuse and lazy parenting in my opinion. If you're a parent to a child with a penis, it is your job to teach your children about their bodies and how to keep themselves healthy and hygienic. 

That all being said, if you're an adult and this is something you want to do, then all the power to you! That's how it should be; It should be a personal choice thats available when you are mentally able to make that decision. I also understand there is a medical need for it on RARE occasions but excluding that, I just can't get behind the genital mutilation of babies, especially when they are unable to consent.",1647779052.0,4

If it’s 100 degrees, well, you don’t wanna see any hotter, so it might as well be 100% hot. If it’s 0 degrees, you don’t wanna see any colder, so it’s 0% hot. Any hotter or colder and you get into the range of excessively hot (e.g. “110% hot”) and excessively cold. For everything in between, the “percent hot” shorthand works, too.

It's hard to keep a dog from wagging their tail, so it's hard for happy tail to heal. 

The wound can end up opening back up whenever they're excited. 🙁

And if it goes on for too long, the tail tip can actually die and turn gangrenous.

Two, omg!  Dude was a film critic. Film!  FFS!  There was a time, which Ebert was certainly aware of, when film was considered the same as video games. They could never be art. It’s just gee-whiz technological whatsits. Ebert should have known this. Even if this was a blind spot - he was certainly told many times about it, and still never changed his position. 

Three, related to point 1 - Ebert was so respected that it is reasonable to say that he had an outsized role in shaping society’s positions. He had a megaphone - one that was especially powerful in the realm of entertainment media. Maybe Ebert’s hot take wasn’t going to impact how redditors viewed video games, but it could certainly impact a lot of people.

Four, at the time of his bullshit hot take - video games were being attacked and targeted for censorship. Unsurprising because this happens all the time, but it was especially active at the time that the most well known expert on art and video was saying that video games aren’t art.  Maybe he did not intend to take away artistic merit as video games defense against censorship, but that’s what his opinion supported. IOW - definitely the potential for real actual harm. 

Five, his defense of his position was this nonsense you’re throwing up now. “It’s just like, his opinion, man.”  Sure, but he was Roger fucking Ebert. How unbelievably irresponsible was it for him to pretend that he had no influence in the real world?  Mind bogglingly so. Bullshit. Having a platform like he had should come with responsibility. 

Final note - I’m not saying that he wasn’t entitled to an opinion. He certainly was.  Again, that was literally what he was famous for. Just that publishing his opinion and doubling down on it after many people pointed out the potential for actual harm his published opinion was - that’s certainly something worthy of getting pissed off over.",1647779893.0,28

So a lot of people have a lot of questions.

I’m mid-30s male and have only really gotten comfortable with myself—including my preferences, turn on/offs, kinks and limits—in the last few years with my current partner.

It can take a long time to really understand what sex “means” to us, I think because it’s so personal and complex.

And then it takes time to figure out what kind of partner/s you want to be with.

2600,AskReddit,What does having a dick feel like?,,1647723811.0,6827,18604,0.81,cakeba,"Dick skin is less sensitive to tactile input than most other skin on the body. Textures and such are more or less lost of the shaft. Much less sensitive to that kind of stuff than the skin on the back of one's hand. The shaft itself is also not super sensitive. It's more ""numb"" than other parts of the body. It gets more sensitive around the head. The inside of the foreskin is very sensitive, almost like skin that's been rubbed raw. If you touch it with dry, salty fingers, it would burn a little bit. It's a lot like the insides of cheeks or the insides of your lips that rests against your teeth. 

On uncircumcized men such as me, the head is the epicenter of sensory reception. The skin is extremely sensitive to texture and pressure; it is uncomfortable to even run dry hand skin across its surface and I can feel my fingerprint if I touch it directly. I imagine it's somewhat comparable to the sensitivity of the clitoris; I  have been with some clitoris owners who would jolt if I touched the clit directly with my tongue. On the same note, it's almost electrical-shock-feeling to me when someone licks the head of my dick, enough to make me jitter a little bit. 

That's when it's hard, anyways. When it's soft, the sensitivity is still the same, but the form factor hugely impacts the way everything feels. When hard, it hurts to bend it more than a few degrees in any direction. When soft, it can literally be rolled up and stored inside my body. It can be twisted a full 360 degrees easily. A solid flick would be painful, but gentle taps wouldn't feel like very much at all. (THE PENIS. EVEN GENTLE TAPS ON A TESTICLE WILL CAUSE A DULL ACHE. A SOLID FLICK TO A TESTICLE WOULD BE PAINFUL.)

But when not in use, it pretty much disappears from my consciousness. There are times where, if I've been sitting still for a while, I would not be able to tell you without touching it which way it was lying in my pants. It's almost octopus-like in its squishability and ability to just lie/squish/nest wherever it ends up when sitting. This is further demonstrated by sports underwear or cycling chamois; if I'm going for a bike ride, I can lift everything up in front and the tightness of the garment more or less just squishes it into a coherent bundle of squishy genital. And I can forget it exists.",1647739315.0,3713

It’s a light tickling pleasant sensation. Lightly flick your nipple back and forth with your finger, it’s a similar sensation and you can feel the “small member” (nipple) get harder and have a relationship to that pleasant sensation at the base where the nipple meets the breast. You get those similar sensations on the dick, although it’s a bigger area then the nipple, and (for me at least) u initially feel it like that under the penis head mostly (the light tickling pleasant sensation) and when it gets hard it’s like a larger/longer/wider version of the nipple getting hard…

When u insert into a vagina all the way so the base of the penis and surrounding body area is touching her body area, u feel a sense of relief and fullness… you feel fulfilled and then the pleasant sensation isn’t as much under the penis head anymore, but instead more focused on the base of the penis. It’s more a fulfillment when body’s are completely touching while inside, but also a little pleasant ticklishness at the base now (but not as sensitive there like it was under the head). However, when u move outward from the vagina u then again get a pleasant feeling under the head again. 

Now u want to move back and forth… As the loose skin moves up and down you get a less ticklish (but still slight tickles), yet a more amplified intense fulfillment at both the base and just under the head. As the strokes go back and forth, so do the amplified fulfillment sensations move between the penis base to under the penis head. Back and forth where u feel fulfillment on each side (base & under head). U go back and forth to feel more and more fulfillment, and fulfillment again. U like to go faster sometimes to feel the alternating fulfillment. Sometimes it’s nice to go slower to draw out fulfillment on each side. 

When u ejaculate there’s an overwhelming electric vibrations type of sensation throughout a lot of the body and in the head/scalp… a relief type of sensation like a really good massage just released a ton of tension. In the penis, upon ejaculation, it’s as if u just finished the end of a piss that was backed up for far too long, another sense of relief... In general, it’s a large tension release with a type of after glow… the penis is then really sensitive and soft with mostly a loss of ability to immediately harden back up because the sensitivity is more prevalent, but without the associated pleasantness.",1647757080.0,16

For the most part, you both walk in the same direction and sometimes you forget he's walking there with you.

Other times, his attention could be pulled to something.

It could be the confident strut of an attractive woman, the reveal of a veiny forearm as a man rolls up his sleeve, or even an especially curvy stick. Every dog is into different things.

When this happens, the dog will pull at your leash (the leash in this analogy is attention/focus/self control) making it harder to pay attention to what you need to do.

The more excited the dog becomes, the more he tugs at the leash, and the harder it is to make rational decisions.

However, the better trained the dog (self control, social awareness, etc.) the less of an issue this will be for the owner.",1647755896.0,9

My wife became furious with me one night because I woke her up and was unable to stop laughing for around an hour.   I wasn’t even watching it anymore.. the image would just flash as I closed my eyes and I would start cracking up again.


It’s a stage panel at some event… no context..
Just some older dude going to cross his legs and I guess he smushed his balls in the process.  

Facial expression of sharp pain and he uncrosses just legs quickly.

Just that mundane motion to get more comfortable coming back to bite you.  It fucking destroyed me.

The crease running the length of the ball sack in the center is where a vagina would have been created if your chromosomes in the womb ended up differently. The male penis is just a woman's clitoris growing outward.

Your balls are roughly equivalent to a woman's ovaries but outside the body instead of inside. Men just don't utilize the internal space for a uterus.

Fallopian tubes are Vas Deferens. It's all similar piping but women get the shit show that is menstruation while us dudes get...not that. Instead we get a pleasure center if excited known as the Prostate. It helps to make what we know as Pre-Cum, and it feels really good if touched gently.

The base of your balls to your asshole, aka the ""taint"", is roughly equivalent to the small distance between a female vagina and asshole.

There's been several comments saying it's annoying that anyone can tell when you're aroused... but that's not always true. The angle of an erection varies just as much as the length and girth. 

For some men, an erection points straight forward perpendicular to their body and makes that stereotypical ""tent"" in the pants. 

For others (like me) it points almost straight up, so that if they stand up while naked it will be only 10 or 20 degrees away from parallel with their torso. With reasonably tight underwear an erection is just a slight bulge in the crotch, and combined with loose enough pants it's almost completely unnoticeable with an average sized dick.",1647753453.0,25

Other examples of raphes include the line ridge running from the front to the back of the roof of your mouth, and the frenulum of the tongue (the line of tissue that joins your underside of the tongue to the bottom of your mouth).  

The frenulum of the penis, the bit on the underside of the glans (the head) which connects or connected the foreskin to the shaft of the penis, is exactly the _same_ raphe as the one on your balls. It extends from the anus to the tip of the penis and is where those tissues fused together as you developed.",1647766312.0,39
2885,AskReddit,What does having a dick feel like?,,1647723811.0,6827,18604,0.81,PM_ME_PARR0TS,"Yep. And hormones play an underratedly huge part in how all these sexual bits look and behave. 

Not even just in utero. When trans guys talk about ""bottom growth"", that specifically refers to testosterone hormone therapy actually changing the clitoris into an apparent small penis - which of course still lacks an internal urinary/seminal passage, but otherwise behaves (and in most ways appears) eerily similar to a cis dick. 

If we're lucky and get results on the large end, we can have PIV sex like any other guy.

Another funny detail - feeling physical attraction with a generally female hormonal profile affects a much wider area. It can feel shivery in the pit of your stomach. Really sensitive on the skin.

But with a generally male hormonal profile, shit tends to become a lot more localized. It's all about the dick. More intense, but much less full-body.

Just some interesting discoveries from my edge-case personal experience that have been echoed back from other people and resources over the years too.

Genitals largely having the same fundamental pipes is a pretty neat topic that people don't talk about all that often, tbh.",1647762885.0,137

Hot AF in 400BC, not so much today. Great for running, horrible for gym showers/being naked around others in general when not aroused. 

I’ve had a few instances in life when I’ve sat down for a dump and because my dick feels the need to be included in everything, I have to pee a lil first but because mine rides high and tight, it’s somehow lines up perfectly to piss between the seat ring and bowl rim if I rest my elbows on my knees as my boy eggs tighten up to hide from the cold air of the bowl below. They literally lifted it up and aimed it to ruin my day without my knowledge.

It is the male ego’s antithesis of having your dick go kerplunk in the toilet water. 

Oh well, I’d rather piss between the lines than have saggy balls that go plop in the bowl like two soggy Yorkshire tea bags ready for the compost heap.

Edit; I guess I should point out I’m American, I.e.  circumcised. I don’t have the natural anteater’s snout/forskin thing to work with aim wise. Don’t get me wrong, I want my dickhead’s turtleneck sweater back. Circumcising babies is fucked the fuck up. I just know 3 other dudes like me who have “pissed between the lines”.

-You will cum super hard if it is stimulated along with your penis. Probs the best orgasm of your life.

-It’s in your butt, so that’s weird.

-There are toys specifically made for this.

-If you choose to explore this aspect of your life, know that your woman may or may not be ok with it. Communication with your partner is always key. They might question if you’re gay because you like your asshole touched. You can be straight and like your butthole played with, it’s ok.

-If you’re not a good hygienist then get better. If you’re not good at keeping your butt clean then man the fuck up and wipe your ass clean like a grown up.

-Diet and exercise are important. If you have good solid poops then you are pretty free to explore that space that God gave you. If your diet is garbage and your poops are half liquid most the time good luck finding anything but terrible in there.

Have fun with your bodies my fellow men. You’re. Not . Gay. Get them butt orgasms. You only have one life in a human body.

So I was 12 or 13 playing in a baseball tourney somewhere out of town. In between the sometimes hours-long breaks between games, we’d play pickup soccer games to pass the time. Anyway, a ball gets passed to me that I just can’t quite get to, I turn around to follow the ball and as soon as I do I get hit SQUARE in the goddamn nuts with the ball… as soon as the ball was past me the defender just tried to boot it down the field, right into my goddamn nuts. I freeze. Everyone else seemed to freeze too, and I felt as if they all did the ‘oooooohhhhhh!!’ thing that we all do when someone gets hit square in the goddamn nuts… and I just keep waiting for the pain… but it doesn’t come.

Externally we resemble females, but female internal organs do not develop until hormones kick in during foetal development, much the same way the penis and scrotum do.

Ovaries and testicles start out as a neutral organ, in the same position as ovaries, descending for males shortly after birth.

Sometimes these changes do not occur entirely though and a child is left somewhere between what is phenotypically male or female, which we've come to coin as intersex.

What's interesting is that this neutral state can develop into a fully grown child at birth and live a relatively normal life without fully developing into either female or male. They will however appear female and nobody will be the wiser until they reach their teens or have a pelvic exam and notice they're unable to have periods, nor do they have a cervix.

Multiple causes of intersex development exist, not purely limited to chromosomal disorders but in the majority of cases it seems to be the hormones or the genes responsible for the hormone receptors.",1647765091.0,22

The Witcher 3 has probably the best original soundtrack of anything to come out for many years. Those folk musicians really knocked it out of the park recording that. I listen to it all the time. It's far superior to the score they use in the Netflix series.

If you like those you should also check out Divinity Original Sin II OST, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Tetris Effect is another overlooked one.

Older: Beyond Good and Evil has great music. Don't skip Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross if you like the Final Fantasy soundtracks.

Retro: A game called Ninja Gaiden for the old NES has one of the best 8-bit soundtracks. It was the first game with cinematic cutscenes. Legacy of the Wizard (Dragon Slayer 4) is great but it's hard to find. And of course the Castlevania series has excellent music throughout (If you like to brood in the darkness). Symphony of the Night is a good place to start. Honorable mention for Sonic the Hedgehog series and Super Metroid. 

An old PC series from the 90's called Wing Commander has really standout music as well. If you like metal, the Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries soundtrack is another memorable one from the days of yore that few know about. That was one of the games where you could put the CD in and skip track 01 and the rest were all music tracks. There's a more recent game called Undertale that has an excellent retro-style chiptune soundtrack, as well.",1647733491.0,246

I was actually kind of surprised they closed because even today it seemed like a decent business model. Each store shared a building with a takeout restaurant, with the restaurant covering the rent for the building. They had a whole section of kids videos that were free. So go order your pizza or whatever and then look at the movies since you're there, let the kids grab a free movie and rent one for yourself. I'd use it for new releases that weren't on streaming yet or their back catalog had a lot of stuff not available to stream or easily found from pirate sources.

Fast forward several years later, there's a holiday gathering at my house. My grandma had passed a couple months before, and we were all in our feels about not having her present for the holidays. This turns into bringing out old photo albums and sharing memories and I bust out the trusty ol' camcorder to rewatch some home movies from when she was around. Family is a little misty-eyed, but enjoying the show. 

Then comes a point in the video where my cousins and I were hanging out and we started talking mad shit about grandma. She was a wonderful lady, but ya know how sometimes when you're around someone a lot they kinda get on your nerves and you have to vent to someone? Well, that's what we were doing in the video and me being the genius I am, recorded this entire bitch-fest. The language got pretty colorful and some tea was definitely being spilled.

As this is going on, I'm desperately trying to find buttons to either turn it off or fast forward but my brain decided to revert back to the very first time I used a VCR and in my panic I couldn't do shit. Finally managed to at least pause it and my entire family is just silently staring at me and my cousins are looking on in absolute horror. The tension could've been cut with a knife and the disdain was palpable.

Then, grandpa, who had been mostly silent the entire evening, launched into the biggest belly-laugh that I hadn't heard for the better part of a year. Which started a chain reaction of laughter that I'm so grateful for. What I thought would be my excommunication from the family turned out to be one of our fondest memories and I feel like our family became even closer that day.

So, keep the memories close, no matter how cringey they may be.

Sorry for writing a book. I just felt like sharing. RIP grandma",1647753617.0,100

The companies love the ticket sales and audience draw, and it's the best advertising for buying other symphony tickets - just hearing the orchestra live in the hall, maybe you'll be intrigued by something else coming up.

Most seasoned orchestral players are fairly tired of the usual symphonies (nobody tires of Bach), so as long as it's for just a week or so, it doesn't get too repetitive. Best seats are the ones where you can watch the screen when you're not playing!

The drawback is it's so mechanical. The music has to be timed exactly to the actions on the screen, so is conducted to a clicktrack.

A projectile like a bullet is designed to move in the direction it is launched and kinda do its own thing, and a door is interactible, but pretty much only rotates. _Edit: ""moving"" in this sense thus means autonomically navigating the world. Doors and bullets do move, but don't have pathfinding functionality._

Functionally, a train isn't that much different to a questgiving NPC: you approach them/move into them, you talk to them/press the go button, and it walks along with/carries you to the next location. So, when it comes to the way your game is designed, reskinning an NPC into a train is much easier than, well, making a train.

Of course, this isn't nearly the case for _every_ game, but the practice of using NPC's as a sort of ""chassis"" for a great many things is so widespread that for example ""x is coded as a minion"" was one of the largest League of Legends memes for a good while.

5132,gaming,Perfect Rotation Speed,,1647722903.0,739,82438,0.87,transmothra,"You ever see one of those videos of a helicopter where the blades look still, but the damn thing's flying around? That's due to the shutter speed of the camera matching up with the speed of the blades, so for every frame, the blades are lined up very close to where they were in the frame before. (You also see this on car rims on older TV shows. The car moves but the rims look like they're moving too slow, or moving the opposite direction of the wheels.)

Same concept, only the strobe flashes line up, so that every time you see the fan the blades have spun and changed positions, but each blade is in the same spot as the blades from previous flashes. The only way to really tell they're moving at all is to mark one blade somehow. We used a big sticker, and the effect was that for each flash, the blades would appear to remain still, in the same position, but the sticker now is in a different spot, since the blade it's attached to has now moved forward in between flashes to the same spot the blade ahead of it occupied on the previous flash. 

Basically, the blades stay still, while the sticker itself spins around and around, jumping from one blade to the next.

Hope that makes sense.

ETA: you need a strobe with a speed knob, because you'll need to tune it so the flashes match up with the rotation speed of the fan. You can also tune it so the fan appears to rotate slowly backwards, say, while the sticker moves slowly forward regardless of the apparent movement of the blades. (I think. It's been awhile.)",1647735621.0,1

2. (optional) Get properly stoned. Trippy music helps. I highly recommend some weird German experimental music from the '70s.
3. Turn on the fan.
4. Turn off the room lights.
5. Turn on your strobe light.
6. Use the speed knob to time the flashes with the rotation of the fan's blades.
7. ???
8. Profit!

If done correctly, you should see the ceiling fan appear to remain still, as if it's off. But the sticker or other marker will rapidly jump from one blade to the next, almost as if by some strange MAGIC you may have unwittingly summoned from a zone beyond even the stars themselves, where incomprehensible and unfathomably evil things lurk, unregulated by the mere forces of physical laws, and completely bereft of anything living beings might clumsily, primitively refer to as 'morals,' while operating on a level only they can understand, if indeed they understand anything at all in their mind-shearing, universe-enveloping madness",1647738948.0,1

-the game tells you nothing. Basic inventory management is never explained. Basic combat is never explained. The game actually lies to you. This is all by design and on purpose.
-it is very, very complicated. I spend about 1/3 of my play session messaging friends or googling. I recommend you do the same to try and figure out what the hell is happening.
-you're gonna die. A lot. Never be carrying more than a level's worth of runes. Farm/grind for runes as often as you can. You legitimately need it to feel remotely comfortable trying to navigate the unforgiving world.
-grinding helped me get comfortable with the timing of attacks because I was doing the same things over and over again. My first mini boss was cake because I had just finished a long xp grind and was dialed in on my timing. This game is ALL about timing. You will feel cheated by how unforgiving it is.

5473,aww,This smiling gecko,,1647738492.0,64,6047,0.99,kmn493,"This is a Leopard Gecko, one of the easiest\* to care for reptiles. If you're looking to get a reptile, I suggest looking into them first and foremost (and not bearded dragons, which *despite their reputation*, are not beginner reptiles). Non-violent, adorable, typically don't mind being held, and relatively hardy despite their small size.

\*Just because they're among the easiest to care for reptiles doesn't mean they don't have a long list of requirements you need to know about them. From the temperatures that each side of their enclosure have to be, to the type of substrate, size of enclosure, variety of food, terrarium layout, etc... It's still a lot. Be sure to check *multiple* sources because several sites will be outdated/contradictory. And don't trust petco or other large petstores.

If you’ve spent any time in any social services field that overlaps with domestic violence: this is all (minus the fame/publicity aspect) absolutely textbook behavior that will likely continue to escalate. 

If his stated goals are to…be around his kids more and/or get her back, his behavior is achieving the opposite. if he had real friends, they would get him to stop it to not harm himself further, but he doesn’t surround himself with people who aren’t yes men and is shocked when people are like, dude, you are the villain in this story and this story involves KIM KARDASHIAN who I think MOST of us loathe! They had a prenup, there’s no reason for the divorce to take this long, but he’s being a controlling creepy ex. 

Honestly, I’m furious because I have never ever wanted to be on any side with her and his behavior is all domestic violence warning signs and he’s made me sympathetic to her.

Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.

A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.

Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.

Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'

The detective said ""Robyn F."" then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.

Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'

After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'

Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.

Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.

Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.

Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.

Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.

Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.

She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.

Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.",1647731050.0,1695

The biggest children's movie will win Best Animated, the most viral documentary will be in the discussion for Best Doc, etc.


The best reviewed albums each year are nowhere to be seen in the AOTY discussion, and the best selling are often missing as well. Then they have the ""Best New Artist"" category where for some reason they feel the need to admit to the entire world they haven't been paying attention to the industry at all, so they'll nominate a band like Glass Animals in *2022* as if they haven't been a festival staple for the better part of a decade or Chance the Rapper in 2017 like Acid Rap wasn't one of the most talked about projects of 2013... For anyone that follows the music industry or music journalism, it's just an incredibly frustrating event if you try to pay attention.

On her own, Sharon has said some real shitty things, largely owing to being a fussy old British boomer. Spouting points of view that have shades of racism, classism and ableism while routinely forgetting her points of privilege, aka, being the manager and wife of one of the most famous musicians of all time.  


Aside from that, she has been the business side of Ozzy's career ever since he left Black Sabbath, and her dad was Black Sabbath's manager. While she has undoubtedly been the force in Ozzy's life that has kept him alive all these years, she is also THE sole decision maker for all of Ozzy's creative endeavors. In the 00's, Ozzy's past band members complained they weren't being compensated fairly for music royalties, so Sharon had their parts re-recorded and then changed the mastering levels of his back catalog when re-released on CD's so she could go into court and say ""see we took your performances out and no one ever noticed you weren't the ones playing the instruments, you don't deserve more money."" Eventually in the 2010's the original recordings got re-released and remastered.   


Being Ozzy's business side also means she's the reason for Ozzfest and how that was run over the years, The Osbournes reality show, The reality show where bands competed to get on the Ozzfest ticket,  every commercial he's ever been in, and every endorsement he does, including their joint shilling for NFT's right now.",1647716641.0,10

6424,pics,[OC] Update to my “face of domestic abuse” post. I divorced him and eventually got my smile back.,,1647780027.0,361,17053,0.9,Transill,"🚨PSA: 🚨

If you are the victim of a strangulation in a domestic abuse situation, statistics show you are 800% more likely to be murdered by that same person if you stay with them. The reasoning that I was taught is that a person who is capable of strangling someone is a person who is capable of murder. It is a very, very personal way to kill someone because you are looking them in the eyes and can feel their life slipping away in your hands.

Also, please view the infographic below if you are unsure if you are in a domestic abuse situation. Also know that abuse is not always physical. Just because hands arent being put on you doesnt mean you aren't in a bad situation (verbal abuse, controlling behavior, isolating you from friends and family, controlling what you wear, who you see, etc...)

Its sad that the guy will probably continue his way of life and hurt lots of more women before he dies.  There was a show on the radio about a serial woman abuser and he abused several until he met one woman who just said no directly and said either you seek help or im leaving. He did seek help and the abuse stopped. This was just one example and its extremely hard for a woman to do that because abuse doesn't just come on the first date. Its a slow cycle of increasing abuse. That is what makes it so dangerous.

Sorry for the ramblings i just wish that it would be possible to end all domestic abuse. You are strong to get out of it and you look happy. It makes me smile.",1647782157.0,-1

OP is of course extremely brave and strong. If you are still in abuse, that does not mean that you are not brave and strong. Abuse lies. It puts you down and tells you that you aren't brave and strong. You are. Living with what you endure every day takes a huge amount of strength. It is exhausting and you are told lies about yourself constantly so it is easy to feel like you aren't brave and strong. 

Courage is not the biggest barrier to leaving abuse, access to money and resources. Being able to execute a safety plan and exit often requires these things. There are resources out there, but they are limited and can be difficult to find and navigate especially while in abuse. 

1-800-799-7233 is the hotline. They are there to help you find a resource in you area and/or to talk. Many believe that calling these hotlines will mean they will push you to leave, most don't and they shouldn't. They are there for you to be supportive of whatever circumstance you are in. If you need support, they are a great place to reach out to when you are feeling safe. If you believe your phone may be compromised, you can reach out online or with a trusted friend/ neighbor/co-worker's phone. You are worth support and safety even if someone in your life has done everything they can to take those things away.",1647787816.0,1

They didn’t care.

She was in jail for the weekend.  She got a misdemeanor (because it was the “first offense” despite police having had four previous run-ins with her) and had forced drug and alcohol therapy. Monitored randomly and regularly (only for the first 6 months) to make sure she had nothing in her system.  At one hearing, she had tested positive for alcohol.

They didn’t care.

I had a restraining order, but she used our connected phone plan to pretend to be me with other people.

They didn’t care.

She got half of everything (assets and property) and I didn’t have enough of my “own” money to pay her out right and keep things, so I have to give her a monthly payment until it’s done.

They didn’t care.

Not sure if this was because it was female on male domestic violence (notoriously belittled), but it is what it is.

I am much happier.  I am glad OP is too.

If there was a murderer planning to kill someone, or several people, and you murdered them to prevent this, is that ""barely better?"" You're intent was to protect, while their intention was to harm. 

Do we as a society have a moral obligation to eliminate threats to innocent people? As a society how far does the justice system go in actually rehabilitating serial killers?

Yeah, all four of them!

Seriously, though, most cops claim to be in it to help people, but then they either engage in willfully criminal behavior or help cover up that behavior by their fellow officers. Cops will *always* put cops ahead of civilians, because as far as they're concerned every one of us is a potential enemy.

Police in the U.S. kill, on average, around 28.5 people per 10 million every year. That number isn't the highest in the world, but it's the highest in the western world by far. No other western nation has a rate above 10 per 10 million. The U.S. has a higher police killing rate than nations like Colombia, Sudan, Rwanda, Mexico, and Pakistan.

We imprison far more of our population than any other nation on Earth, and the estimated rate of wrongful conviction in the U.S. is between 2%-10%. We have a higher number of wrongfully convicted people in prison than most nations have prisoners in total. Police misconduct is the leading cause of wrongful convictions in the U.S., with more than half of wrongful convictions involving police misconduct.

And police are rarely punished for their misconduct, because they protect one another at all costs.

It's a step up for the generation it was built for.  That second story & garage represents the advantages of simply being white Al Bundy in America after WW2:  lots of resources, high demand, reduced competition and sophisticated infrastructure & education systems which are able to grow with demand... thanks to collecting and spending taxes.    This further fuels a hungry economy, widening it's effects among the public & increasing incomes - making a bigger down payment and a bigger mortgage payment for a bigger house possible for millions more people.   Al Bundy has no skills.  Just like the owners of the shoe companies, Al didn't build the road, grow the wilderness,  develop Conservation techniques in a State College, or get a GI bill loan.  But he benefited from all of it with cheaper, faster housing,  enjoying a higher quality of life than the people who did build it.

Married with children was basically one of the first American shows that focused on the ""awful wedding"" trope.  Previously married people were mostly depicted as functional and mostly happy.

Al Bundy the football star marries the hottest girl in the school. He becomes a loser, balding shoe salesmen. His wife becomes a TV junkie who nags him constantly. To make this worse, he is nagged all day at work by women who can never seen to be pleased.

So he just wants to get home and have a beer and watch football. His wife did not want to work or do household chores. She just wants to shop. Clearly pushing the stereotype of a ""trophy wife"" that is just physical looks and selfish. Al did not enjoy his life with her. In fact, Al had a general poor opinion of women.

Their son is sex crazed like most males are depicted.  The daughter was depicted as the dumb blonde who slept with any guy that courted her. She was shown as the daughter no father would want.

The entire show was about a dysfunctional family and Al was never shown as really sex starved, more that he didn't want it from his wife but also didn't want to cheat.

The thing is you are confusing the situation. This was depicting a sexless marriage because the neither side was happy.  Al Bundy was rejecting Peggy.  Sure I get you might see it as some guy with a hot wife should be all other that, but it's more of you ignoring their relationship.

Al rejecting advances from other women was showing him as honorable. That he may get no respect from anyone, but he certainly was not going cheat on his wife no matter how crappy of a person she was and even if she cheated on him. If Al cheated then he have been seen as a horrible person but by not cheating you could feel empathy for him when everyone berates him. If he cheated, then he would have been just as bad as his wife instead of the guy trying to be a good person to the best of his ability. Putting up with a crappy wife and trying his best to provide for his family when if they created him badly.


So nobody noticed what you are talking about because they watched movies like revenge of the nerds which was about sex starved nerds. It came out in 1984.

Bob's burgers always frames characters as rational actors who have their own goals and desires, but are aggresively incompitent at what they are trying to accomplish. They have their dreams, but everyone in the show is kind of a fool.

You'll never see an episode of bob's burgers with something too tense going on. No end of the world events, and most conflicts are summed up as the characters suffering from something that is little more than a small inconvinence. It's impressive that Bob's burgers has such a mundane cast and story lines considering it was supposed to be about a cannibal's burger restaurant.",1647739494.0,3

They are currently collecting signatures for repealing it.

To put into perspective their greed... If the kid who inherits the house doesn't want to live in it, the taxable base resets to market value at the time of inheritance. For many of those this means resetting from $100-300 thousand range to $1-3 million range; i.e. about 10x increase in property tax. This actually isn't nearly as bad as it sounds for investment/income property:

* Properties in CA appreciate in value about 5% annually. Property tax is about 1% of taxable base. Taxable base can not increase more than 2% annually until property changes hands. So it only gets better and better over time as far as heir's net worth goes.
* Annual property tax is a small fraction of annual rent the property can generate, even with taxable base at current market value of the property. And it only gets better for the landowner as years go by. Because property tax can not increase by more than 2%, but rents are increasing by far more.
* Landowners get to write off taxes as business expense.
* Landowners get to claim ""depreciation"" on rental properties (seriously? ""depreciation""? on something that *increases* in value 5% annually!?).

So.. Nope... The state isn't taxing out of those properties those ""poor"" heirs who just got ownership of investment/income properties basically for free. Those ""poor"" heirs in reality just inherited a huge wealth that keeps increasing in value and generates income that *far exceeds* property taxes, even if they are reset to market value at time of inheritance.

Meanwhile, the rest of us ends up being priced out of the market. No small wonder home ownership has been steadily declining in California.

Frankly, any kind of investment, income, or otherwise commercial property should be excluded from Prop 13. Ideally, the entire Prop 13 should be repealed and at the same time taxable base divorced from current market value of property.

Oh, and prevent landowners from claiming ""depreciation"" on things that *gain* in value year after year.",1647720801.0,12

Putin went all in expecting to simply walk into Ukraine and take it while Zellensky and his government ran, what he got was the entire world uniting in an extreme reaction because they’re all sick and tired of his bullshit, sick and tired of the bots and paid professional trolls stirring up race hate on our social media, sick and tired of the slew of dirty Russian money flowing through many in our governments. Putin’s regime has been fucking with just about every Western country via the internet for at least the last ten years.

The world is sick and tired of Putin’s bullshit and they’ve had enough. Putin no doubt assumed there would be some temporary economic problems that would affect the oligarchy over there, but he figured he would very quickly appease them by giving them the spoils of invasion to rape money out of. That didn’t happen and the oligarchy over there are losing absolutely insane amounts of money. 

Being barred from the Black Sea shipping lanes alone has probably impacted Russian criminal oligarchs smuggling operations in drugs and human trafficking untold amounts. That’s people you do not want to piss off. 

Putin is a dead man. Either by his hand or someone else’s. It’s only a matter of time. He’s cost too many people too much money and he’s not going to be able to get it back for them.

>edited for clarity.

Don't get me wrong. I utterly despite Putin. But word has it, he used to be kind of eloquent and charismatic in the beginning. He buttered everyone up to gain their trust and then he practically sowed the seeds discord in the EU and helped assholes around the world getting into positions of power. No one really noticed and those who did were trolled. Everyone was at each others throat - playing the blame Game while he and his allied-assholes were enjoying the show.

If their next successor is again something like that, everyone needs to be on their toes and be aware that it all could repeat itself.

The elite like they exist in Russia have no use for a democratic leader who respects human rights and might call laws into existence that don't fill their pockets hard and fast.

This was operation vRYAN. Russian nuclear strategy was whoever launches all their missiles first wins, so if they thought the US was going to launch, they wanted to get all their missiles in the air first (US strategy at the time was ""we can use limited nuclear strikes if the Soviets use chemical or biological weapons"" but the Soviets didn't believe in limited nuclear strikes, so you can see how bad that would have turned out). I don't know anything about modern US military planning, that stuff is still classified obviously and I'm just a civvie, but so far the Russians seem to be playing by that old playbook

The Soviets also used training exercises (as they did with Ukraine) as an excuse to prepare for invasions, they were preparing to invade Poland in 81 because of the solidarity labor movement and were almost certain (to the point of having bombers taxing on one raise preparing to launch) during the 1983 NATO Abel Archer war games because they thought we would act like them. Andropov also spent the last years of his life in and out of hospitals, supposedly like how Putin has been lately.

And don't feel bad about forgetting Chernenko, everyone did. He was already one foot in the grave when Andropov died. All he did was cough on everything before dying a year into his leadership, supposedly he even passed out during his first address.",1647778967.0,28

Those are not the people we should be remembering.

Let us instead remember heroes like Georg Elser who tried to take out the entire higher Nazi management with a bomb in 1939 but failed because Hitlers speech was shorter than usual and didn't hit him. In attendance:  Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Rudolf Hess, Robert Ley, Alfred Rosenberg, Julius Streicher, August Frank, Hermann Esser and Heinrich Himmler

This man was a true hero. He absolutely saw what was coming. He did not wait for the war to turn against the Germans and then try, he wanted to save the world from what was coming.

He was a normal worker, no personal gain beyond Hitler dying, just a man who saw what needed to be done.

Be like Georg

Or maybe it's a way of keeping up morale on their side, or trying to distract attention from other behind-the-scenes shenanigans that may be going on (e.g. if you're worried that your assassination plans are about to be leaked, it might be a good idea to start spreading rumours about nonexistent assassination plans so that nobody takes the real ones seriously).",1647779156.0,54

Hitler dying without losing WW2 Would mean that vicious and evil ideology wouldn't lose all credibility. There is a reason their were no new facist or nazi states after ww2.

But without WW2 (say he dies in 39, just before poland) hitlers legacy becomes ""The Democratically elected leader who revitalised the german economy, ended the humiliation of the treaty of Versailles, gave Germany its ever greatest territorial extent and ended the violent civil conflict that was burning through germany in 6 years.""

Hitler likely would have gone down with the greatest ever german chancellor, if not then certainly up there with the likes of Bismarck. That would completely legitimise nazism as an ideology.

Obviously we know how nazism ends, a ruined nation, and a tens of millions dead. But they wouldn't.

I actually think its very important to the world that hitler lives,  from the beginning to the defacto end of the war, where he finally blows his own brains out.

Basically every invasion of Russia has come straight from the west, through Germany, the Baltics and Belarus. The land there is flat and easy to move across. It’s why the German blitzkrieg was so effective until they got to Russian cities. Soviet and Russian military doctrine has been to create a ‘wall’ of buffer states to blunt advances from the west. Let those buffer states take all the war and destruction first. And those countries, Poland, the Baltics, Belarus, and Ukraine used to be the “plug” that would prevent NATO armies from spreading out onto the plains and make fighting NATO impossible. But Russia lost the Baltics when they joined NATO, and now they lost several other countries to NATO. From their perspective, NATO is trying to encircle them on their own borders. 

It’s why they’ve propped up Lukashenko in Belarus. And why they’re attacking Ukraine now. They are psychologically incapable of allowing the last ‘barrier’ countries to join NATO. In a conventional land conflict, either Belarus or Ukraine being in NATO would mean western Russia, including Moscow, falls within days. Given what we’ve seen in Ukraine, I think NATO air forces would establish air superiority between the border and Moscow within HOURS not days. And NATO isn’t reliant on rails to transport and distribute war matériel so they’d go where they wanted while Russian forces need to move mostly by rail. Defense of Russia itself requires time and distance. From a military perspective they NEED Belarus and Ukraine as border countries under their direct or indirect control to get that time and distance. Zelenskyy was making noise about joining NATO and Russia can’t have that. If they even applied to NATO, invasion of Ukraine would be inevitable within days. I think Putin was hoping for Trump to be President because it could have shattered NATO having Europe say one thing and having the US say something entirely different.

But in reality he's always been an egotistical bully with more pride than brains and this is just the first time he's been properly called on it. It makes me think of the idiot at a Blackjack table who wins a few hands and boasts about his ""system"" and then loses everything he made because it wasn't really a system at all, he was just getting lucky.

Putin kept taking and pushing and testing limits and some people see that and go ""Ooo man what a mastermind, he knew *exactly* how far he could push!"" but I think we're giving him too much credit. A super power bungling an invasion this catastrophically can't just be the senility of one old dictator, this is the fault of hundreds that have risen to power under Putin over decades, this is a structure he sculpted around his own rise. And it's dogshit. Putin wasn't a mastermind who has suffered some mental deterioration, he's just exposed for the brainless thug he's always been. Why would a mastermind build such an incompetent government around himself? Why would he have men who are better at licking his ass than doing their jobs?

Because he's not a Bond villain, he never was a Bond villain, he's a Russian thug that just kept taking because no one stood up to him, and we applauded his schoolyard bullying as some incredible 4D chess.

I agree with this point, because I feel like the West have their own leaders to blame, for simply not standing up to him when they had all the previous chances. The 'major' sanctions that have been recently imposed, should have been used at latest, for the annexation of Crimea. Every time he's pushed a little harder, and the West responded with nothing but hot air and frowns, he knows he's gotten away with it, and can get away with more next time.

I'm not saying we should have invaded Russia the first time Putin looked at us side eyed, but that there should have been proportionate, and escalating diplomatic and sanction responses, more quickly, and more strongly, to earlier Putin transgressions - **before** he has invaded an independent country, and started slaughtering civilians.",1647784282.0,1

It's all done for the same reason why GOP pushes wedge non-issue issues like abortion, gay rights, birth certificate of the black president, welfare (but if they are black) and threat of communism. It's all to stay in power.

Putin's popularity started to wane, partially due to to 2008 crisis that has destroyed the legend that he alone guarantees Russia's stability, so when he has said in 2011 that he will be  the president again after 4 years of being a prime minister, there were protests. He thought he was betrayed and a patriotic turn happened - oppressive laws were implemented, 20 people got prison time from Bolotnaya protests. etc.

Also economy began to stagnate because the impulse of the economic reforms from the beginning of 2000s has finished working, everything that could have developed, did. Putin didn't implement independent courts, rule of law, and more than that he turned to government controlled corporations in 2007.

So the only thing he could sell now is a territorial gain and a military victory, since the prosperity has stopped being enough and there was no new one. Western countries sell security threats the same way on a lesser scale all the time - ""think of terrorists, give us more power"", ""think of the child porn, kill all encryption"".

So Putin took Crimea, is was a wild success, it's the only legitimate territory outside of Russia Russians consider to be ""theirs"", they were ready to suffer economically for the win. Donbass was popular too but after a couple of years people began to get tired of spending money on foreign affairs when the country is still suffering. And when in 2018 before election Putin has not suggested anything new, a new wave of disillusion began, new wave of protest, protest voting, several opposition governors were elected, a circus has happened. Same in 2019, but Moscow took more control. Even more in 2020.

Then a de-facto coup has happened - Putin has changed a constitution, gave himself 12 more years of presidency, increased his power, and prepared several places he can retire into - National Council which can have unspecified presidential powers, and a place in Senate for all ex-presidents.

The current war seems to be a repeat of Crimea and Donbass - it's a polarizing thing that can increase popularity short term, and be a pretext for further militarization of internal politics (Search for Greg Yudin articles on that), meaning instead of disdain for opposition, they can be considered more of the enemy, while masses will rally around the flag. Only the operation didn't go how they expected - they way it did in Crimea, or in Donbass initially, Ukrainians didn't greet the Russian army, it didn't all end in 5 days. Also West isn't fractured and didn't add some weak sanctions like the first 2 times.

Putin also has delusions of redoing the end of Cold War results, but it's all secondary to elites trying to stay in power and continue to secure their stolen wealth.",1647785420.0,1

> The attack comes after the mayor of Mariupol said Russian forces forcefully deported several thousand people from the besieged city last week.

> In its latest update on the conflict the MoD said: &quot;Over the past week Russian forces have made limited progress in capturing these cities; instead, Russia has increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties.&quot;It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.

A big part of preparing soldiers for war is through systematic dehumanization and reprogramming. Soldiers are trained to abandon their human empathy for others, and to only see targets as targets. There is specific training for overriding the instinctive psychology most of us have, where we are repelled by extreme violence against others.

I don't remember if it was after WWI or WWII, but at some point, governments became aware that most of their soldiers missed on purpose during the war. Not due to bad aim, but because they didn't want to kill random strangers. And the governments of the world have been working hard to ""rectify"" that since.

Technology absolutely helps, though. It was significantly harder to kill a stranger in warfare with a sword, once upon a time, slightly easier with a gun, but doing it from a warplane? Or a mortar? Or with a drone? Where you literally don't see humans, just tiny specs on a screen?

If every firing hole, every window every building could have a combatant in it taking a city is a very scary prospect.

Still can’t defend it, still won’t defend it but it’s happening. I’ve seen pictures of Ukrainian armed forces inside things like gymnasiums so the fact a school is targeted isn’t out of the question. Otherwise these buildings could become safe havens for entrenched troops who hide amongst civilians sheltering. It’s why guerrilla warfare is so hard to combat whilst maintaining any sense of humanity. Something which if the media is to be believed the current Russians have little respect for.

It’s abhorrent that innocents are dragged into this but more should have been done to get the civilians out before the encirclement. It’s clear Russia has little respect for humanitarian corridors and it was naive to think they would.

Sanctions don't work.  Didn't work on North Korea, didn't work on Russia the first time, didn't work on Iran, didn't work on China.

Putin may be a dick, but he isn't crazy.  Don't be surprised when Finland or any of the non-NATO European nations are next.  Or Taiwan.  The west is giving China the green light to go ahead and finish taking Taiwan.

The best we can hope for with the current course of action is Russia getting bogged down in a costly quagmire like Afghanistan, which is arguably what killed the Soviet Union.  Maybe there will be an uprising in Russia to depose Putin.  I doubt it, though, since a majority of Russians support Putin's actions.

I hope I'm wrong, but I honestly think this is just the beginning of what will lead to USSR 2.0, and an expanded China.  At some point there will be a nuclear Iran as well, which will completely change the balance of power in the middle east.  Because you're right: no one wants to risk escalation to a nuclear war.

Maybe something good will come from all this.  Maybe the world will sprint to energy independence.  Maybe we'll largely do away with fossil fuels.

Humans have the ability to be good, and the ability to be bad. We will be either depending on the situation, our upbringing, or our environment. And even the terms good and bad, are not really correct too. Things we deem bad now, we didn’t think was bad before. Some people in the world are vegan, and they believe it’s wrong to harm animals for food. But imagine trying to explain veganism to a person from 5,000 years ago, they would be absolutely bewildered that someone would refuse to eat available food. And when explained it’s for moral reasons, they would be even more confused as they believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with eating meat you hunted. It’s a similar situation with good and bad, what you think is good, probably won’t be considered good forever, and what we think is tolerable, is probably going to be considered insane in the future. 

I went off on a bit of a tangent there but my main point is that human morality is not subjective, and a lot of us would do things we would never dream of doing if we were desperate enough, or we were taught it was right to do by other people. Rape is about the closest you can get to objectively bad, morally wise, and I can’t think of a society that ever thought raping was a morally good thing.

Right now not a single country is able to select a leader that won't be power-hungry and corrupt, by design. Sometimes rare anomalies like Sankara happen, but you can see at his example how fast they are being dealth with. If a good person will want to become a ruler - he won't even be able to compete with those who ruthlessly ruled various buisnesses and saved enough money to run those elections, or with those who have powerful and rich friends to fund them (and those friends will later ask for benefits, of course). Becoming a ruler for selfless person is impossible in our world, and current rulers will never want to change the system that benefits them, the upper class, and not to anyone else. So that problem is up for people to solve. 

Another huge problem is capitalism. When people make limitless earning and accumulation of wealth as goals of life, and build entire society around it - it leads to soceity being dominated by egoistic sociopaths, who put profits above anything else (look at any megacorp to see the example). 

Thrid problem is the laws. They are often aimed to make lifes of criminals better, and lifes of common folk - worse. Not to speak about how people are using money to be above any laws.  The laws should be more about justice, and less about compromises. 

People could achieve global peace, but it would be greatest challenge humanity ever faced. And almost every single person who is currently in power or aiming for those spots will do anything to stop that.",1647779581.0,2

Yes, it would have been different under Trump.

It would be **worse**. At the very least, worse for Ukraine. 

- Trump's administration would not have [released valuable intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/biden-administration-russia-intelligence/index.html) ""in an effort to disrupt Russian planning, blunt the effectiveness of any ""false flag"" operations and, ultimately, deter military action.""
- Trump has already shown that [he is willing to hamstring Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal), which [may be a direct factor in the current war](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n9dq/alexander-vindman-russia-ukraine-invasion). It stands to reason that if he were still in power, he may take an active role.
- Trump would have likely [tried to leave NATO](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-nato-withdrawal_n_5c3d8cb4e4b01c93e00d1e2d).

----

The **only** way this would be better for the US is *maybe* Putin would give us a discount on Russian oil if we support (either explicitly or tacitly) them in this war. 

However.... 

- Estimates vary, but only between [three percent](https://www.allsides.com/story/how-much-russian-oil-does-us-import-and-how-can-dependence-be-reduced) and [eight percent](https://nypost.com/2022/03/08/how-much-oil-does-us-import-from-russia-what-biden-ban-means/) of our oil would have been discounted.
- If we supported Russia in this war, the other countries might end up putting sanctions on **us**.
- Supporting Russia (again, either tacitly or explicitly) *might* (but most likely not) be beneficial in the short term for the US (at the cost of millions of Ukrainian lives), but Putin is a bully. There's no way he would stop with Ukraine. A solid victory in Ukraine would embolden him, and he would keep going. He also would view Trump as a pushover... As soon as Trump's ability to influence things on Russia's behalf ends, Putin would throw Trump and the US to the wolves. It would end up being bad for us in the long term.

----

> Putin still would've done this invasion. This isn't something he just THOUGHT up the moment Trump lost. He's probably had this planned years and years in advance.

Yeah. 

- He's been planning this invasion for years.
- He [meddled in the 2016 election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections) to get Trump elected, because Trump would be favorable for him with regards to the election
- He [meddled in the 2020 election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2020_United_States_elections) (albeit unsuccessfully) to extend Trump's time in office 

My theory, based on the evidence, is that Putin was waiting for the time to be right before he invaded Ukraine. He was hoping the 2020 election would go in Trump's favor. It didn't, but Putin likely had committed to a specific timetable - either explicitly, or as a matter of circumstances - so he had to go through with the invasion **anyway**, despite not having backing from the US (which Trump would have accomplished) 

----

TL;DR: Yeah, Putin was going to do this regardless of who was President of the United States. But he was **hoping** it would have been Trump, because Trump would have supported him.",1647780898.0,3

I assume there are other markets developing countries could get that food from. There is no gaurantee that if those developing countries were given the seed directly they could make proper use of them. 


On the flip side, if they are going to be used to feed Russians, are we mad about that? Im sure Russian citizens are feeling the sanctions right now, but I have no idea what is able to be provided for them. Surely we dont want to sanction them so badly that everyone there starves?

And are we supposed to just trust everything that comes out of Russia? That Ukraine is full of nazis? The us is making bio weapons there? 

I’m just looking at how things are going. Russia is failing to take Ukraine. They’ve had 5 generals killed. And barley took a city. 

So if they were to invade an actual nato country. Like Poland. Who has a much more experienced military. They’d get crushed.

And they’re bulldozing it to break moral. Like the Germans did to the uk in ww2. Break the moral of the people the fighting becomes easier and they might roll over. 

But Ukrainians are very tough. And aren’t broken easily. So Putin is just gonna keep trying. He’ll level Ukraine if that’s what it takes.

If he engages in warfare with one NATO nation, he will have engaged in war with all of NATO. So, Putin's line is currently to get away with as much as he can without doing that.

That's where Putin understands the line to be, and that's where NATO understands the line to be.

If we suddenly and unexpectedly change where that line is by establishing a no fly zone, or otherwise entering into the war anyway, suddenly we create a huge unknown, and that is the situation in which Putin panics... and who knows what he might do then. That's what escalation is.

That is why that is the situation that it's NATO's best interest to avoid at all costs.

I feel like surely Zelenskyy can understand that as well as we do, despite his present situation.

I guess as far as he is concerned though, there isn't really much difference between the war as is, and an escalated war involving all of NATO. But as far as the rest of us are concerned, there sure as fuck is a huge difference.

“Esper couldn’t say the same about Trump. In fact, Trump had privately indicated that he would seek to withdraw from Nato and to blow up the US alliance with South Korea, should he win reelection. When those alliances had come up in meetings with Esper and other top aides, some advisers warned Trump that shredding them before the election would be politically dangerous.

 >Numbers 31 is the 31st chapter of the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Pentateuch (Torah), the central part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), a sacred text in Judaism and Christianity. Scholars such as Israel Knohl and Dennis T. Olson name this chapter the War against the Midianites. Numbers 31, set in the southern Transjordanian regions of Moab and Midian, narrates how an army of Israelite soldiers commanded by Phinehas (commissioned by Moses and Phinehas' father Eleazar) waged a war against the Midianites, killing all men and boys including their five kings, and taking all livestock, women and girls captive.

10460,movies,Steven Spielberg Says He Won’t Direct Another Musical After ‘West Side Story’,,1647722047.0,940,11088,0.93,ShaunLevi1995,"Considering that Westside Story is based on Romeo and Juliet, but set in then-modern times to make it relevant, wouldn't Spielberg have faired a little better to do a modern re-telling of the basic premise? Maybe instead of 50s greaser gangs, have it be about two star-crossed lovers who are affiliated with the Bloods and Crips, Latin Kings and Gangster Disciples, or maybe rival drug cartels in Mexico. 

  
I had zero interest in this film, and you'd think I would considering I'm Latino and I enjoy films Latin American/Spanish-language films. It was probably a fresh story for its time, and I still want to see the original at some point, but the concept in 2022 comes across as very quaint and outdated. Is the message really relevant to at-risk youth who post and watch videos of gang-related rappers getting shot in the head on Instagram Live (rapper and Blood gang member Indian Red Boy) for entertainment, and who follow YouTube personalities like Crip Mac, who has ""Hoover Killa"" tattooed across his forehead to show that he's murdered at least one rival gang member from Hoover Criminals? 

  
Teenagers who need to hear the movie's so-called ""message"" are just going to laugh at it. I doubt the musical's message even had any real impact when it came out. Were at-risk teens really going to Broadway shows in the 1950s? Did the 1961 have a positive impact? Because the second largest Latino street gang in the world, 18th Street, was formed sometimes in West Los Angles in the 1960s, and has expanded throughout L.A. county and into Central America. The Crips were founded in 1969. Chicago's Gangster Disciples were founded in 1969. Maybe the musical and the films are actually, unintentionally, normalizing gang life and gang culture.",1647753704.0,3

I don't think most people understand how to do a movie musical.

Moulin Rouge works, but stuff like this and In The Heights doesn't because Moulin Rouge was made to be a film, and the others were musicals turned into movies.

This music was written by Leonard Bernstein who was the conductor for the New York Phil for a good while starting in the 50's (I think?).  Imagine someone who was so well acquainted with music that he is selected to run the lead symphony for America during America's peak.  He knew all of the major works that would be performed and was familiar with all of the newer 20th century stuff that really pushed music theory into a new territory.  Then he wanted to create a musical that used some of these techniques, while still sounding great.  THIS MUSIC IS FUCKING HARD.  Lots of great Latin influence on the brass playing, crazy syncopated lines, lots of dissonance, and written by a man who is used to working with the best musicians America has to offer.  There is 20th century technique called serialism or 12 tone writing.  Basically you create an order of notes but you have to use every note (all 12 tones) first before you go back and repeat the pattern. These notes can be any length or register and audiences usually HATE this music.  It is super hard to play and sounds like ass.  The song ""Cool"" from West Side, has a 12 tone sequence in it that is actually melodic and interesting.  

I guess i'm trying to say is that this is one of the hardest musicals to perform, takes its inspiration from Romeo and Juliet (meaning the acting has to be A+ for people to buy hearing this story again), and already has an Academy Award winning version of it in existence.  No shit he doesn't want to do a musical he just did THE musical and everyone kinda went.... ""meh.""",1647762513.0,145

I’ve forced dozens of people over the years to watch the original 1961 movie as not only the best movie musical of all time but maybe one of the best movies of all time. I’ve been obsessed with it. I saw it on Broadway and loved it. I’ve listened to the soundtrack a thousand times. It’s easily one of my top 3 favorite musicals of all time. 

When I heard a remake was coming out, I was very excited but also very skeptical. I figured I’ll keep my expectations low but hey at least they cast actual Hispanic people to play the Hispanic characters so at least they got that right.

I was blown away. I can’t believe Spielberg did it. He actually managed to equal and maybe even best the greatest movie musical of all time. 

Every creative choice he made, I was in love with. The way they did “Cool” felt so much more intense and high stakes. The rumble felt more realistic and I was more engrossed. “Gee, Officer Krupke” was absolutely brilliant and had me laughing as hard as when I first saw the original version. Rita Morena doing “Somewhere” was the choice I was most torn about because I was so ready for that to be a duet. But I cried during that number because I could feel her pain and sorrow as she grieved a world that seems to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. It emphasized that as old as the musical is, the story it tells is still just as relevant today as it was then. Still today we turn ourselves into “us” and “them” based on arbitrary things that shouldn’t matter. Skin color, how rich your parents are, which side of an imaginary geographic line you were born on, what god you do or don’t worship, what language you speak, how big you are, how strong you are, how much marketable skills you have, where you went to school, what car you drive, what phone you have, what friend group you hang out with, how tall you are, how fat or thin you are, what gender you are, what sexual orientation you are, what hobbies you have, what foods you eat, what music you listen to, what accent you have, what clothing you wear, the list can go on forever. 

We find ways to separate “us” from “them” and then over and over and over again treat “them” with unimaginable cruelty.

It’s a story as old as time and will continue to be relevant for as long as human nature continues to be that we turn people into “others” and treat them terribly.",1647763087.0,1

Now the Congo book that /u/PopPopPoppy referenced was absolutely ignorant crap based on stereotypes Herge had picked up from contemporary news and so on. But then he met and became lifelong friends with sculptor [Zhang Chongren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Chongren), who was an overseas student studying in Belgium at the time. This friendship inspired Herge to do more research into the places he was depicting, and take responsibility for what his comics showed to people.

As a result of this influence, Herge went on to disown his earlier, stereotype-based ignorant stories and indeed in most countries stories like the Russia and Congo episodes have not been widely sold in decades. His later stories would involve a great deal of careful research and an attempt to be fair to those depicted, rather than just based on 'common knowledge' stereotypes.

The character you linked is directly based on his good friend Zhang, with an almost identical name (in terms of contemporary French romanization). The two of them worked on the character together, and Zhang also informed Herge about what was happening in China at the moment, thus the Mukden incident (and its reality of being a fake excuse by the Japanese to invade) and the colonial Japanese being depicted (this depiction of the Japanese is still fairly racist, but here we must also take into account that his information was coming from a Chinese person whose country was currently being colonized by them, so not the most fair and neutral of sources).

Zhang would return to China and suffer through WW2, the Chinese Civil War, the Cultural Revolution, and so on for four decades before being reunited with Herge. During this time, motivated by missing his friend and concern for his wellbeing, Herge included Zhang's character Chang in *Tintin in Tibet,* where he had Tintin called from far away to Chang's aid when he was in trouble.

After China opened up once more, Zhang moved to France for the rest of his life, and the two reunited in real life at last.",1647741631.0,57

The movie is an upgrade over the Wise version in most aspects. Pretty much the only part thats worse by comparison is the recontextualization of Somewhere.

Tony and Maria's reconciliation does work narratively without that song. The cute moment with Rita Moreno wasn't worth that trade off.

Riff and Bernardo were both strict upgrades from their originals.  Maria and Anita were at worst side-grades.  Tony is more debatable, but I'd argue that Beymer wasn't really any better overall than Elgort.

The thing about Herge's racism is that yeah, it definitely exists but only in the earliest of his books, a lot of which are hard to find in English ( Congo especially) and they were written in the 30's. Easier to get in French but I've never seen an English copy of Congo

Herge never stopped dealing with foreigners, they're all over TinTin but the man clearly changed his views on other races and it is clearly reflected in his later work. The 7 Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun are my personal favourites and they are really respectful to MesoAmerican culture.

Not a fan of the movie but TinTin is not some massively racist publication. It's origins are racist but the later stories are not and I can't speak for anyone but TinTin sparked my entire interest in other cultures when I was a nipper",1647768915.0,3

…… this might be literally the worst take in this entire thread. 

What do you even think West Side Story is about?

It’s not a love story, just like Romeo & Juliet wasn’t a love story when Shakespeare wrote it. 

It’s a pointed critique of humans creating “us” and “them” to justify cruel behavior to “them”. The love story of Tony & Maria just like with Romeo & Juliet is not meant to tell a story of “look how amazing this love is”. 

The story is actually about how our shitty world that forces people into tribes and to take sides time and time again ruins everything.

The story between Tony & Maria is meant to display another innate part of human nature which also makes people stupid which is love. It’s not logical, and when two young adults like them fall for each other they make poor decisions. But this is part of human nature and something that can be beautiful. 

But tribalism and the “us” versus “them” mentality that pervades societies throughout history overrules everything else and destroys all the other beauty in the world. 

Criticizing the tendency for people to form tribes to justify cruelty and hate towards others is absolutely extremely relevant today and will continue to be for years to come.",1647768185.0,5

So clearly Amblin wasn't off-limits. Then what was the rule? Indiana Jones was in the movie as a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" poster clearly visible in Halliday's childhood room. There's not a whole lot more that would fit. Jaws or E.T.?

Indy was pretty much an American Bond, he cast Sean as Henry Sr. because of his work in the series, cast Shaw as Quint because of From Russia With Love... And iirc they didn't reject him for conflicting visions. So I see him being pretty open to Eon's input. Still, that's a very valid point and could come in the way.

But yeah, as someone whose favorite franchise is Bond and thinks of Spielberg as one of the best directors ever, Top 5 even... Yeah. Steven Spielberg's 007 is one of my greatest fantasies.

Personally speaking - and as much as I love Lewis Gilbert, and that is still my favorite Bond film either way - I always wondered what Spielberg's The Spy Who Loved Me would've looked like. It is a movie that fits his style like a glove. Considering that _that_ was the moment he was rejected, as he says he went after Cubby Broccoli right after Jaws (and therefore in-between TMWTGG and TSWLM), if he were accepted, he would've gotten precisely that one.

I would argue that Ansel was one of the highlights, though.  Whom he was playing opposite of, was the biggest problem.  Her lack of any actual acting experience really showed, and both her interpretation of Maria and the writing combined for a very flat character.  Maria is supposed to be a vibrant, excited, rebellious, just-come-of-age young woman who pushes boundaries, while the Maria we got was this coy, innocent, shy, timid girl, who I didn’t and couldn’t believe once that she would go against her brother and family’s wishes.  There’s also such a lack of chemistry between her and Ansel, I question whether they even screen tested together.

It felt like they used the book of horror movie clichés as reference material when writing the script and the movie is glorious for that. 

* Protagonist gets stuck in small backwater town? Check.
* Spookiness that everyone except for the protagonist is at least vaguely aware of? Check.
* Team of kids are the only ones who really know what's going on? Of course.
* Kids proceed to make incredibly stupid decisions anyway? Hey, you know that room where a bunch of people committed ritualistic suicide to transfer their souls into the animatronics we're literally here to destroy? Let's bang in there! 
* Spooky things toying with the characters before going for the kill? Absolutely!
* Cliché dialogue? It's so cheesy you could supply a sandwich shop for a few months with it.
* Over-the-top action / fight scenes? They're the best! Each animatronic dies in a unique way but the crowning achievement was the one who got curb-stomped into a urinal. 

I don't even really like horror stuff but this movie was a very entertaining ride. Plus, Nic Cage's ""dialogue"" is just grunts of exertion and intensely staring at people.",1647745582.0,49

Let People Watch It,,1647725928.0,252,3593,0.96,Horus_walking,"> Amazon has concluded its deal to purchase MGM for $8.5 billion.**Most folks are focused on what will happen to James Bond (spoiler: not much, since MGM only owns half his rights and the owners of the other half are very stingy with what they’ll allow the property to do)**. Others want to know what the internet’s megastore is going to do with classic characters like Rocky Balboa and Robocop, both of whom are owned by MGM. Will the world finally get to see Apollo Creed fight the ED-209? Who can say.


> That said, I have a slightly more prosaic concern: What will happen to MGM’s library?


> Or, at least, the part of MGM’s library that MGM still owns. **Back in the 1980s, Ted Turner bought MGM’s pre-1986 catalog as part of a deal designed to give his then-nascent cable companies some 2,200 films for people to watch as well as a film studio from which he could make shows and movies for TBS and TNT. Still, Amazon is getting about 4,000 titles, which they could add to their Prime Video service**. In theory, it seems like a pretty simple thing to add them to the Prime Video and beef up the number of streaming titles to offer to viewers.

> In practice, though, it’s not so simple. While many, perhaps even most, MGM titles are already on various streaming services, there are others that aren’t. Getting a title ready for digital isn’t free, especially if you want to do it well: If you don’t already have HD files ready for upload, you need to find negatives or lightly used prints to make a proper digital transfer. And if you want to update what you do have from HD to 4K, well, you’ll probably have to find the negatives anyway....

> **All of which is to say that it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario in which Amazon makes some percentage of their new MGM titles available while letting many others wither on the vine**. After all, consider the state of 20th Century Fox’s library under its new owners, Disney.

> **Again in theory, the vast 20th Century Fox holdings should be a boon for Disney**, given that it owns both Disney+ and Hulu. Disney+ could serve as the site for family-friendly fare, while more adult-oriented material could migrate over to Hulu. **In reality, older film libraries are never worth quite as much as we film lovers would like.** You remember when you’d walk into a Blockbuster and see a single movie taking up an entire wall in the new release section? That’s because 90 percent of business came from the newest 10 percent of titles. People want to watch new stuff.


> **Which means that Disney doesn’t really have much reason to spend resources making movies like The Firebrand or Night Train to Paris available online. But they also understand these are assets and all assets are worth protecting, which is why Disney has been incredibly stingy with allowing repertory theaters to show classic 20th Century Fox titles like Alien or the remake of The Fly.**


> **Despite one of the world’s greatest film libraries (20th Century Fox’s) being owned by a company that has two separate and well-trafficked streaming services (Hulu and Disney+), the films available on either is spotty, at best.** Let us hope that the same fate does not befall MGM’s library.",1647726043.0,107

So if Amazon could release one movie a day to Prime, it would still take 11 years to move all of those movies to Prime.

So I would not be surprised if people see the MGM movies slowly but surely trickle into Prime as they are digitized and the legal issues are ironed out.

Reason 1) I actually don’t like to watch movies in Hi-Def or 4K, I think they look better on DVD, and I have a 55 inch screen. When ever I buy a new TV, I always have to turn the motion smoothing off because it takes me right out of the film entirely. To me it looks like a shitty soap-opera. (And Yes, I know the difference between the 3) 

Reason 2) Blu-rays usually don’t come with cool stuff. Sometimes they come with a digital copy, but that usually goes right into the trash. I only watch TV on my TV. But DVDs come with all kinds of cool stuff! Some come with books, posters, stickers,…. My copy of Exit Through The Gift Shop even came with colored glasses! 

Reason 3) They are typically much cheaper, so why would I buy a Blu-ray that looks bad and doesn’t come with fun stuff and is more expensive? 

I hope that helps a bit. People used to make fun of me for having a big DVD collection, but now a lot of my movies aren’t streaming anywhere anymore, so I’m glad I saved them! Who’s laughing now? 😄",1647769012.0,0

Were it not for gaming consoles putting blu-ray in people's homes by default, it likely wouldn't have had the penetration it enjoyed at its peak, which was - again - *still* significantly lower than DVDs.

Niche isn't the same as ""totally unsuccessful."" It has a lane, and it's doing decently in that lane. But it's never sold what anyone involved wanted it to, and because of that, even less titles than were released on DVD are being released on blu-ray (and even less than *that* on UHD) and even as successful as DVD was, less titles were released to that format than were to either VHS or LaserDisc (LD being the first niche-success video format that was *clearly* better than the one it failed to supplant).

Which is why ""just buy the movie"" doesn't work as well as we'd like it to - a lot of stuff simply gets lost as we move forward.

I decided to give it a rewatch about 11 years later or so, and yeah I still thought it was neat, but it's definitely not up to par with some of his other films. 

I think the varied characters of both the Commandos and the Gorgonites is well done, and the classic surprise on who's actually good vs evil is fun, but I don't think the movie has as much humor and lasting power as it could have.

Somehow, Natalie Portman sold a character obsessed with performing something perfectly - even if it destroys her to do so - better than Miles Teller did. 

I think Black Swan hedged its bets more by throwing in some interesting subplots like the lecherous director and the sorta-kinda lesbian romance with the Mila Kunis character. Even if you really don't care about ballet, there are lots more ways to relate to Portman's character. Whiplash really is 100% about jazz drumming, and unless you really really really care about it, the movie is going to seem like two obsessed weirdos in a dogfight that means nothing to anyone outside this tiniest of circles.",1647734097.0,-23

He has a lot of good to say about it as a movie but points out the flaws it has as a 'music movie' or a movie about music and I think he does a good job summarizing many of the arguments why. 

But if you want a TL;DW, it is because it is basically a sports movie about jazz instead of sport, but one layer deeper, it's *actually* a movie about an abusive relationship, obsession and addiction. 

So, from a musician perspective, the big point of it is that a 'teacher' like Fletcher isn't just an asshole, he's also deeply wrong about everything he has to say about music. In the literal sense that his story about Charlie Parker is more of a myth than reality, but the figurative sense of trying to induce 'greatness' through torment is so far from what music education is about or what the teacher-student relationship is about that it's hardly worth mentioning except in condemnation.

The romanticized ideal of the hardcore asshole genius musician is still around, and there are some of them, but the world has changed from when this was accepted. These days, if you're an asshole people won't want to work with you. Whiplash is based on an outdated premise...those guys simply don't exist any more, because students have options. If you're a player, you only put up with someone like that if they are truly a Kingmaker; stick it out and you get something truly unique and powerful. You put up with JK Simmons for one of two reasons: if you make him happy he gives you an incredible career, or he does such an amazing job of teaching you to be better that you put up with that bullshit to get to his instruction. These days, people can talk more easily...if he's doing phenomenal things with a band in NYC, but there's a guy doing almost as good in Chicago but is less of an asshole, the guy in NYC will start having students leave. Once that happens, administration gets involved and says, ""Why are all these students leaving?"" If he pulls the,""I'm a genius, fuck them"" approach, he won't have a job for long. 

So, he's either an absolute genius and powerhouse who has unbelievable sway within the music community, in which case he probably didn't get to where he is by being a dick. Or, he has such amazing knowledge to impart that students will put up with damn near anything to get at it, which doesn't really seem born out by the events in the film.

Also, the sabotage makes no sense. A drummer playing the completely wrong song doesn't look bad for the drummer, it looks bad for the guy leading the band.

Lots of things just don't ring true - he goes back for his sticks? Are they magic wands attuned to their wizard handler? No. I played drums in jazz band.

They are supposed to be at one of the best music schools in the country, but rehearsal is run like the students don't know anything. So many of the issues Fletcher tries to address would have been practiced at home. Things he tries to teach would have been learned *years* before getting into the top group at a school like that.

Many of the music choices don't make sense. There's no good reason to play that piece that fast. Playing a piece faster than normal doesn't magically get you more points at a competition.

As a drummer, the drumming stuff isn't right, especially the practicing. Just trying to muscle through the speed is the worst thing you can do. Then he gets the bloody blister on his right hand, but that shouldn't even be possible in that spot. It means he isn't holding the sticks correctly. Someone who is supposed to be at that level would know all of these things. Also, punching through a snare drum like that would be ridiculously hard. I don't want to say it's impossible, because I've never tried.

Those are the big things that really took me out of it. There are also some smaller things that don't really affect the plot, but were annoying.

However, I do think the movie captures well the abusive mentor/pupil dynamic. That seemed very realistic and could be applied to many situations. The acting was phenomenal and J.K. Simmons deserved that Oscar.

Whiplash captures how being critically taught can *feel* (especially when you're young and vulnerable), it depicts a fascinating kind of abuse, is a solid character study, and somehow serves as a weird sort of inspiration in spite of these facts.

While I can see that you're right, *some people* would walk away thinking that, I think it's fair to completely dismiss that criticism. The movie is about the push and drive for greatness and the cost of achieving it. You could replace the drums with anything competitive and the story and theme would still work (though the score would probably not be nearly as interesting). No matter what competitive skill they chose, people could complaint that it showed that group in a crazy light because the *themes* were about the manic side of greatness, so it's not really valid criticism to say it's a commentary on musicians or drummers.",1647750151.0,5

Adenomyosis occurs when the endometrium grows and sheds inside the uterine muscles, forcing the muscle tissue to separate. Compared to endo, the resulting pain is more like repeated sharp stabs. I delivered my son without anesthesia just so I could compare the pain of adenomyosis and labour. Within 20 mins, I dilated from 7 to 10 inches, and that's when I thought the pain was matched. Different but matched.

Adenomyosis can cause heavier periods. For the first three days of my period, as soon as I inserted a menstrual cup, it was already full... I was basically pissing ""blood"" and so iron deficient that I wasn't functioning (despite daily iron supplements with vitamin C).

I've lost count of the number of doctors I've seen about my symptoms. I ran out of local doctors, so I made out of town appointments. Before appointments, I would dress professionally and practice speaking succinctly and intelligently in an effort to make them take me more seriously. They didn't. Not until I brought my husband to an appointment and he demanded that something be done about my symptoms. Suddenly, a doctor I had seen many times before deemed me worthy of the only cure for adenomyosis, a hysterectomy, which gave me my life back. 

Harmful biases are so deeply engrained in medical training and practices... adenomyosis itself won't kill us, but the resulting diminished quality of life deserves to be addressed with research and empathy.",1647782875.0,7

They always brushed me off, and it wasn't until I had surgery on another matter did it even get diagnosed. 


I think my biggest fear is that now that I have endo, my symptoms are all too similar with ovarian cancer, making it very difficult to ever get attention for monitoring it because docs just say it's my usual endo symptoms, with no further investigation.

All I want is to be taken seriously and have doctors be more proactive in keeping a lookout for this, but no tests (and I don't mean ultrasounds) or proactive monitoring is ever suggested for me. It's frustrating.",1647774688.0,49

>Endometriosis (en-doe-me-tree-O-sis) is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis. Rarely, endometrial-like tissue may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located.

>With endometriosis, the endometrial-like tissue acts as endometrial tissue would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But because this tissue has no way to exit your body, it becomes trapped. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions — bands of fibrous tissue that can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.

>Endometriosis can cause pain — sometimes severe — especially during menstrual periods. Fertility problems also may develop. Fortunately, effective treatments are available.",1647764790.0,37

I’ll be on birth control for the rest of my life, or until someone takes this seriously and starts researching it and trying to solve it.

Just to expand on my journey with the healthcare system, I had a cyst on my ovary for *years*.  Every time I went to any doctor I would complain about the debilitating back pain that I was experiencing, pain that made it so I couldn’t move some days. I have a distinct memory of laying on a staircase crying because I couldn’t make it all the way up the stairs.  I was told I was exaggerating.  That maybe I should exercise more (I am not overweight and was not at the time). When I was finally able to convince a doctor to do an actual test, they found a huge cyst on my ovary.  But when the surgeon I was assigned consulted on me, she told me there was no way that it was causing my pain, cysts like this were benign, that this would be a pointless surgery to have it removed.  I had to convince her too. But removing it did fix the pain.  I was right.",1647783342.0,5

Six surgeries since and now waiting for a hysterectomy (I have adenomyosis as well). 

My mum had awful periods, pelvic pain and bowel issues her whole life. When she had a prolapse, she had surgery and they used vaginal mesh which caused years of pain that wasn’t treated or investigated. Years later she started having bowel issues and other symptoms and was told it was IBS. Two years later she died from ovarian, bowel, peritoneal and stomach cancer at just 61. 

I would love to say that things have improved in the nearly 20 years since I was diagnosed but I see no evidence of that. I’ve been involved in several studies run by the specialist hospital I’m under but it still takes not far off a decade to be diagnosed on average. It’s unacceptable.

I took myself off that after 2 years because mood swings were never even my main issue, and they are now nonexistent unless I get occasionally a little impatient due to constant pain. 

My issue has always been debilitating mastalgia with hot, double-sized breasts for one sometimes two or more weeks of the month. More recently I started with extreme abdominal swelling and digestive issues in the week before a period.

So now here we are 20 years later, I’ve had my hormones tested by my family doctor but they were normal. From the gyn, I was given an endometriosis pill called Orilissa for a passing symptom I mentioned, painful sex, without any exploratory procedure to find out if it really was endometriosis. That made me feel even more congested and it stopped my period so I took myself off it after four months. 

Bottom line is my gyn definitely thinks it’s a head case. At least now I’m old enough to have mammograms which identified I have heterogeneously dense breasts so I have those every year to make sure it’s not turning into cancer. Every year closer to menopause, I hope for eventual relief. Looking back, what a shame I missed so much.

In general there are four options:

Pain management - long term pain killer use may be enough for mild cases, but it does nothing for the debilitating aspect of this condition.

Hormone therapy - this is generally used as a first step and means either going on a specific type of pill permanently, or a type of HRT which can have pretty damaging side effects if you’re young. It works for mild to moderate cases but not consistently.

Removal via laparoscopic excision - invasive, expensive, effective in the short to medium term but requires specialist training and presents a high probability of generating more scar tissue, requiring more surgery in the future.

Total hysterectomy - has its own hormone implications and it’s obviously a savage way of dealing with it. It is not regarded as 100% effective in all cases.

This would be a valid theory if endometriosis and endometrium were histologically identical! Here is an excerpt from the Center for Endometriosis Care's website :

""Endometriosis is not just ‘painful periods’ - nor is it simply rogue bits of normal endometrium implanted in abnormal places, caused by backflow menstruation, as many articles, the media, endometriosis foundations, spokespersons and even some scientists continue to incorrectly describe. Endometrium – the lining of the womb which breaks down and is shed during menstruation – is histologically different from the functional glands and stroma that comprise endometriosis lesions. Contrary to popular public doctrine, while the tissue does resemble – it is not identical to – the native endometrium."" 

Additionally, extrapelvic endometriosis is much more common than previously understood and has been found on every organ in the body! The *only* current effective treatment for endo is true wide excision surgery with an endometriosis expert, although there are hormonal options for managing symptoms! These will not slow the progression of the disease, though.

While a lot of women experience severe pain with their period, many (like myself) experience very little, or experience pain that isn't tied to menstruation at all. Other women experience pain at all times regardless of where they are in their cycle. Some women have no symptoms and only discover their endo when they are trying to have children, other women have debilitating chronic pain. Some women with no pain have stage 4 (the most severe) endo, while others with severe pain have stage 1. There is also a really common misconception that you can't have endo without having a close female relative with it, which also isn't true.

In my experience, the only pain I experienced was during intercourse, and other than that maybe some heavy periods but that was always blamed on the type of birth control I was using. It took a decade of painful intercourse, difficulty with urination, and eventually developing severe bowel issues that lead me to look into endo. I only looked into it after I learned about endo from a youtuber I watched, as it was never brought up a single time by my obgyn who knew about the issues I was struggling with. I had my first excision a few months ago and discovered that not only do I have extensive endo, but it's affecting my ureters and would have likely led to renal failure had it been left untreated. It took me ten years, multiple different doctors, hundreds of hours of medical research, and finding my own specialist/surgeon to get to this point. Pain with periods, family history, and infertility are usually the go-to diagnostic criteria, but there are so many more symptoms that are interconnected and important to be aware of when it comes to finding treatment for endo.",1647784124.0,5

why? because when you go in with symptoms, which happen MONTHLY, you're ignored. over and over and over. you're told it's not that bad, to take ocp, to take antidepressants, everything but actually look into to WHY this is occurring. everything but trying to treat the condition. 

when a man goes to the doctor, he is believed when he says his pain is severe. when a man goes to the doctor, they run tests and try to find out why, try to find a diagnosis based on evidence in real time, like labs, x-rays, biopsies etc. when a man goes to the doctor for pain, he isn't told that the pain is normal, and prescribed antidepressants. 

you cannot study a disease if you ignore the patients with it, that present with symptoms. Endometriosis isn't studied because the patients aren't being treated, they're being brushed off. so, the disease flys under the radar. not because it's a minor (which it isn't) condition. Erectile dysfunction is a minor condition. it doesn't cause pain. it doesn't destroy reproductive function. BUT, it has been studied VERY widely and has a half a dozen Rx treatments. and, I am sure when a man presents with ED, no one tells him to just suck it up, and get back to work.

I browsed through the website you linked and this group commented that retrograde menstruation alone cannot fully explain the pathogenesis, but it does not say it is completely wrong either. Also the article they cited about current literature saying retrograde menstruation is wrong was an in vitro study. It sounds like the retrograde menstruation theory postulates that once endometrial tissue leaves the endometrium, local factors from wherever the tissue goes changes the cells to a degree, which may account for some histological differences. By doing an in vitro study, my understanding, is these local factors are not there any longer, so not sure how strong of a conclusion one can make from a study like this.

The Mirena will not affect your risk of blood clot. The contraceptive that is more likely to cause a clot is the combined pill which has both oestrogen and progesterone. The Mirena/mini pill/implanon and depot only have progesterone which usually only causes risk of clots in high doses beyond what the mirena gives.

 Tubal ligation won't affect your cycle at all, it only blocks the tubes and so your pain will continue. A hysterectomy at a young age tends to avoid taking the ovaries as these have a distinct purpose of making hormones for your body's wellbeing and health. These hormones will continue to cause cyclic flare ups and endometriosis is a hormonal disease, the uterus is not really involved in causing it, only in producing some of its symptoms. If you did have a full hysterectomy, it would mean needing hormone replacement therapy until you are about 50, and even then this can trigger endometriosis.

What you probably want is either someone who can do excision surgery (though it's not always possible), or to consider GnRH injections (if these work then it's pretty much endo, though they put you into a temporary menopause).",1647772032.0,176

Having more female researchers absolutely would help, no question, but maybe not as much as you think. I know there's an element of bias that could potentially affect results, and I'm not sure how to counter balance that, but I really think that there needs to be at least one person actually suffering from a moderate to severe version of the condition on the research panel. Not all women magically understand the suffering and woes of other women, and I've run into a distressing number of them who think that *because* they're a women, despite being healthy with no serious or similar issues, it automatically makes them sometimes more knowledgeable about various conditions than the people suffering through them. I think that's part of why the medical attitude of ""oh come on it's just a regular period you're overreacting"" attitude is so prevalent, especially from the nurses who are more hands on for individual patient care. They're the ones relaying pertinent information to the overseeing doctor, and if they think a patient is overreacting or a hypochondriac, I imagine an over worked or busy doctor isn't too liable in enough situations to make an assessment that says different. 


Without the perspective of someone who has gone through these conditions to help researchers understand the impact of the research, even as just an advisory role to help give a fuller understanding of the data collected, I'm afraid of an overly removed clinical conclusion being made, but I also know that that is deeply rooted in my experiences of basically being told I'm lying for attention when I've been in so much pain I wanted to die, and had so much of my medical care neglected because either doctors didn't believe me, or just did not know enough or understand the condition well enough to give me the care I need. Even today my doctors basically know jack all about PCOS or what I can do to help it, besides fertility management which is so far from what I care about as to be offensive. If it isn't birth control, they have no clue what treatment I can try, and I'm  hundreds of miles away from any medical center that has even a basic understanding of this condition.

There's a fair few meta analyses out there that show that there is no real discernable effect of most progesterone contraceptives and thrombosis. The only ones they tend to identify are higher dose medications such as the depot contraceptive (the mirena being the lowest dose preparation).

There's enough evidence to suggest it's safe. Obviously everything comes at risk, and they only way to pick it apart (to see things like tiny increase in risk) is to do absolutely massive studies, which are not always possible. The thrombosis UK society/charity is happy to tell those with clotting disorders that the low dose progesterone medications are safe.

Edit: another thing to add is that a copper coil is more likely to exacerbate the situation in your case as it causes localised inflammation. It can make bleeding heavier as well (which is a common symptom of endometriosis/adenomyosis).",1647775952.0,36

If I offer surgery I essentially also offer a risk of organ damage, risk of needing a stoma/colostomy, I aslo offer a risk of failure to treat anything. Whilst these risks are low, they would not occur without the surgery, and even the best surgeon will have a risk of these complications being about the same as average as each patient presents a different challenge.

Needless to say, I'm happy to offer it if I think it's suitable, but it's not necessarily the get out of jail free card a lot of people thing it will be.

 A lot of the issues are mainly on the patient understanding of how the disease works, it makes a lot of the journey for them much easier. The onus is on us to explain it properly. Time is always a struggle in clinic as it takes a while to explain endometriosis and I have 20 minutes to take a history, examine and explain/come up with a plan. I tend to focus a lot of time on the explaining part, as well as explaining where the journey may go. So I guess my frustration comes with clinic timing more than anything.

One of the things you can do as a patient is ask what happens next if things work, or don't work. You can also. Ask about the processes they are trying to correct.

Researchers found that individuals at greatest risk of developing the addictive symptoms of CUD were those seeking relief from anxiety and depression, suggesting the need for stronger safeguards over the dispensing, use, and professional follow-up of people who legally obtain cannabis through MMCs.

“There have been many claims about the benefits of medical marijuana for treating pain, insomnia, anxiety and depression, without sound scientific evidence to support them,” says lead author Jodi Gilman, PhD, with the Center for Addiction Medicine at MGH. “In this first study of patients randomized to obtain medical marijuana cards, we learned there can be negative consequences to using cannabis for medical purposes. People with pain, anxiety or depression symptoms failed to report any improvements, though those with insomnia experienced improved sleep.” Particularly disturbing to Gilman was the fact individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression -- the most common conditions for which medical cannabis is sought -- were most vulnerable to developing cannabis use disorder. CUD symptoms include the need for more cannabis to overcome drug tolerance, and continued use despite physical or psychological problems caused by the cannabis.”

The study was more directly looking at the fallout from the fact that patients can receive a medical marijuana card without any counseling, help with dosing, or any medical or psychological follow up at all. The title is certainly misleading; what the press release (this is not a scientific article nor an abstract but a third party’s press release) states is that what the study found is that 10% of people who immediately received a medical marijuana card did not report an improvement on their pain, anxiety or depression symptoms but did develop  a substance use disorder— which they defined as increased tolerance to weed and continued use of weed even if it was not helping or causing further problems.

You have a health issue that can help, albeit momentarily, with something. And now that you've grown dependant on I it, it became a problem because you realized you were dependant on it?
Thats weird logic, you should fint it problematic if it's an actual problem causing you some form of harm. Not because you're told it's bad to have an addiction.

People are addicted to all kinds of things it starts being a problem when it hinders you in any way or if it becomes a thing that degrades your health. Neither are things cannabis sounds like it's doing to you. Cannabis isn't bad in of itself. The act of smoking is bad. But ingestion of cannabis has shown very little worrisome results. It has the ability to make an addiction sure. It can also push forward mental issues like psychosis. But what we know right now it isn't clear why it's even illegal.

Anxiety and depression are, crucially, self-reported during diagnosis. The logical assumption one can make here is that the most significant number of **fraudulent** acquisitions occur in these demographics.

Then quitted for many years and decided to give it a go out of boredom during the lockdown. Didn't go too hard, just a couple of puffs from a dry herb vaporizer, I'm very experience with the substance right? Wrong!!, got a full blown anxiety attack that only subsided on my way to the ER, mainly because of said previous experience and me not really wantiong to deal with doctors for something like that, should have taken some valium in retrospect.

Me being a stubborn motherfucker decided that that terrible experience wasn't going to stop me from trying to escape from the boredom and kept trying on subsequent occasions during the next weeks. 

Kept getting way too high for a while until the tolerance rised and then it was business as usual, problem with that is that then the use intensified from weekend nights to daily evenings until I decided to quit again as I didn't want to become what I was before.

What you describe is like chugging some vodka as a person with no tolerance to alcohol and not understanding why you end up puking all over your bed.

It’s more than just doing something a lot, much more.

>In this retrograde signalling process, excessive stimulation of a post-synaptic neuron releases endogenous cannabinoids that act on presynaptic receptors located on glutamatergic excitatory neurons to reduce hyper-excitability and possibly prevent seizures. However in vivo, the circuitry is often more complex, with presynaptic CB1 receptors located on both GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals75–77. The endogenous cannabinoids modulate neuronal excitability of brain circuits by regulating both GABA and glutamate release. The overall net effect depends on multiple factors such as the degree of expression of CB1 in GABAergic versus glutamatergic neurons, the anatomy of the local circuit and the signalling efficacy in each neuron, which may differ based on brain areas.

>CB1 receptor stimulation can indirectly activate the dopaminergic system that mediates the rewarding effects of many drugs (FIG. 3). Although CB1 receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain, dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain do not express CB1 receptors75. It is most likely that THC indirectly increases dopaminergic activity by influencing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain78. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), CB1 receptors are primarily located on GABAergic neurons (as opposed to glutamatergic neurons). One proposal is that THC activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors on VTA GABAergic neurons inhibits presynaptic GABA release, allowing dopaminergic neurons in the VTA to fire78. In two small human PET imaging studies, THC significantly increased dopamine release in the limbic striatum79. The increase in dopamine levels was much smaller than that elicited by psychostimulant drugs80 and more like the changes produced by alcohol.

>**Humans who cease regular cannabis use can also experience a withdrawal syndrome** (see Diagnosis, screening and prevention, below). In some PET imaging studies, the availability of CB1 receptors was negatively associated with severity of withdrawal symptoms94, suggesting a direct role for CB1 receptors in cannabis withdrawal. The intensity of cannabis withdrawal was reduced by CB1 agonists such as dronabinol or nabilone93,95 or nabiximols (which is a ~1:1 combination of THC and CBD)96. The blockade of FAAH to enhance anandamide levels is another potential way to reduce withdrawal symptoms97.

>Acute Effects and Insight into Reinforcing/Addictive Properties of Cannabis

>All drugs of abuse increase DA release — a key neurobiological process that generates their reinforcing effects (Koob and Volkow 2016). Here we evaluate the acute changes in DA circuitry associated with cannabis intake in preclinical and clinical studies that provide basis for the reinforcing effects of cannabis. While the two main constituents of cannabis are delta9-tetrahydracannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), THC seems to be responsible for cannabis’ addictive potential due to its psychoactive properties and associated effects on brain dopaminergic function. Acute THC administration elicits striatal DA release in animals (Ng Cheong Ton et al. 1988) and humans (Stokes et al. 2010; Bossong et al. 2015; Bloomfield et al. 2016). However, another study found no evidence for THC-induced DA release (Barkus et al. 2011); this may be because THC induces quantitatively less DA release than psychostimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamine (Volkow et al. 1999a). Nonetheless, these findings suggest that THC increases DA release similar to other drugs of abuse.

Clearly dose dependent, but with indirect GABA/glutamate/dopamine effects via cannabinoid release, it's no surprise the withdrawal symptoms take the appearance of a less dangerous, much shorter, and more mild version of simultaneous benzodiazepine and stimulant withdrawal.",1647776728.0,-3

I smoke daily myself so this isn’t coming from someone who is anti drug. In fact I think cannabis is pretty good overall in comparison to other drugs and treatments but I feel that the culture around weed is the issue. Before weed was banned originally you could go down to your apothecary to get some and they’d tell you how to use it and how much. Once it was pushed underground and made illegal the “pot head” culture sprung up to fill the void. Potency back then was waaaay different than standard strains now. Now with just about everything being 20%+ thc with no cbd (the antidote to the neurotoxic effects of thc) there is a lot higher chance for down regulation, paranoia, etc. 

Smoking 20+ % bud every night is, in my opinion, like drinking hard liquor every night.

>The cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS) is a criterion of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition) and cannabis dependence (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10). Several lines of evidence from animal and human studies indicate that cessation from long-term and regular cannabis use precipitates a specific withdrawal syndrome with mainly mood and behavioral symptoms of light to moderate intensity, which can usually be treated in an outpatient setting. Regular cannabis intake is related to a desensitization and downregulation of human brain cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors. This starts to reverse within the first 2 days of abstinence and the receptors return to normal functioning within 4 weeks of abstinence, which could constitute a neurobiological time frame for the duration of CWS, not taking into account cellular and synaptic long-term neuroplasticity elicited by long-term cannabis use before cessation",1647780168.0,1

>Proponents of cannabis generally dismiss the idea that there is a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. One routinely hears statements such as, “I smoked weed every day for 30 years and then just walked away from it without any problems. It’s not addictive.” Some cannabis researchers, on the other hand, describe serious withdrawal symptoms that can include aggression, anger, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, depression, restlessness, headaches, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Given this long list of withdrawal symptoms, it’s a wonder that anyone tries to reduce or stop using cannabis. Why is there such a disconnect between researchers’ findings and the lived reality of cannabis users?
  
>A recent meta-analysis published in JAMA cites the overall prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome as 47% among “individuals with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids.” The authors of the study raise the alarm that “many professionals and members of the general public may not be aware of cannabis withdrawal, potentially leading to confusion about the benefits of cannabis to treat or self-medicate symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders.” In other words, many patients using medical cannabis to “treat” their symptoms are merely caught up in a cycle of self-treating their cannabis withdrawal.

Acute Effects and Insight into Reinforcing/Addictive Properties of Cannabis
>
>All drugs of abuse increase DA release — a key neurobiological process that generates their reinforcing effects (Koob and Volkow 2016). Here we evaluate the acute changes in DA circuitry associated with cannabis intake in preclinical and clinical studies that provide basis for the reinforcing effects of cannabis. While the two main constituents of cannabis are delta9-tetrahydracannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), THC seems to be responsible for cannabis’ addictive potential due to its psychoactive properties and associated effects on brain dopaminergic function. Acute THC administration elicits striatal DA release in animals (Ng Cheong Ton et al. 1988) and humans (Stokes et al. 2010; Bossong et al. 2015; Bloomfield et al. 2016). However, another study found no evidence for THC-induced DA release (Barkus et al. 2011); this may be because THC induces quantitatively less DA release than psychostimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamine (Volkow et al. 1999a). Nonetheless, these findings suggest that THC increases DA release similar to other drugs of abuse.",1647780554.0,0

There is not enough time for organic molecules to form outside of our galaxy and get here, so you can’t really multiply the low probability of life forming by the number of cold rocks in the universe.  We are left with a balance: is it more probable that life arose on earth over billions of years, or it arose over a not so impressively larger number of rocks and took billions of years to travel here? We already know the seeds of life can arise thru common chemical processes in the early earth.  Why does it have to come from somewhere else?

Fred Hoyle was one of the original proponents of this idea.  I remember him showing me the probability of even a single crucial molecule was 1/10^40,000.  This was his justification for panspermia.

So chemists, astronomers and many more worked to find reaction pathways to look at how they are forming. One of the brightest ideas currently being worked on is solid state reactions occuring on interstellar grains. These grains accrete molecules from the gas phase forming a layer of ice of many different types of molecules. These molecules are then ""hit"" by what's called galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) which deposit energy into the molecules and form highly reactive radicals, which then form more complex molecules. The reason radiation in the form of GCRs is so important is because of how cold the molecular cloud is. Most chemical reactions occur thermally (that is at temperatures we are used to or more) rather than 10K.

To have life, you need a way to store information in molecules that can be replicated. Carbon chains are some of the most flexible chemicals in terms of stability and also ease of covalent bonding with a range of atoms, forming more complicated functional groups. The issue is there are a finite number of elements to work with. About 90 or so. Carbon is the best of these. Water is then a useful choice because it has oxygen and hydrogen in it, two of the elements that work best with carbon.

Next, you need life to be in the liquid phase. That's just a practical issue. Gases will just float apart, and solids don't really work because if I have a pile of nutrients over here and a pile of nutrients over there that need to mix, they don't just jump onto each other. liquids naturally facilitate the mixing of chemicals, and so all life that we know of is liquid-based (your cells are full of liquid, called cytoplasm).

Once you have down that it needs to be a liquid, and you need to use carbon, you get restricted a bit in terms of temperature, because too hot and the carbon molecules you built out of carbon start to fall apart, and too cold and the reaction rates necessary for life get too slow (this is intuitive but reactions happen slower or not at all at low temperatures). So not too hot, not too cold.

The last piece is you really need a solvent that is polar. This means that it has positive and negative ends. That's because polar solvents can dissolve other polar molecules (letting them move around) but don't dissolve non-polar molecules (so they can stay put together and do things). Having this ability to have some things get moved around and others stay together points to having a polar solvent, and Water happens to be a very polar solvent.

Water ticks all of these boxes better than basically anything else. It's possible you could have life in a different liquid solvent like Dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol, but these other choices are either more complicated and unlikely to form a lot of naturally, or are too unstable and could lead to chain reactions with oxygen that result in the production of water anyway.",1647704914.0,11

This transition is between two phases of solid water.  So as one went down the water column at the relevant P-T regime, you would see first liquid water, then ice-VII, then this phase ice-VIIt, then ice-X.  Sequestration by a solid phase has already happened but he time this polymorph is relevant.

It’s possible that microbial life could exist at the interstice of ice crystals  at *some* elevated pressure, assuming the formation of a eutectic formed by dissolved ions, but that’s not relevant here.  Further, this structure is the more rigid one, which suggests such a space would be smaller. That’s not to mention the pressure regime is absurd.  Polymerization, or any other reaction that results in a positive change to standard molar volume, is thermodynamically disfavored at high pressure.

Finally, mineral (and dissolved ion) content in our ocean is largely derived from continental processes for a number of geochemical reasons that would hold on other planets, too.

So I gather that rather than us having no proof of it existing because it’s hard to find and the conditions have to be just right, instead it’s just because the conditions are so extreme we haven’t actually be able to go there and check if it’s really real. We’re very certain it is there, existing “naturally”, and doesn’t need to be made just to exist.",1647710347.0,30

Metallic hydrogen has been claimed to be created in the lab. By Paul Loubeyre, Florent Occelli and Paul Dumas.

The most common argument is that the narrow but non-zero band-gap the hydrogen might be a narrow band-gap semiconductor, rather than a metal.

In any case metal cannot be ice since it does not sublimate.

Ice has a very specific set of characteristics in astronomy it can sometimes be used to describe solid volatile compounds that sublimate, in chemistry that use it not standard.

The article covers CO2 which does sublimates in solid form but it doesn’t not cover Dry Ice which isn’t a scientific term it’s a branding you can check out yourself, it was trade marked in the 1920’s.

Edit: A good topical example would be the word condensation or condensate.

In physics and general chemistry a condensate is the product of a gas condensing into a liquid.

In organic chemistry a condensate or condensation is the term used for a specific reaction when molecules are combined at the loss/explosion of a water molecule.

I didn't read all the way down, so some of this might be somewhere in what I didn't read.  I also only read the first half of the article.

Most folks seem to be under the mistaken impression that religion = spirituality, and while they're often listed as the same category as well as used interchangeably, they are different.  There can be times when they mix, and more often than not (depending on how widely you look), they do.

Religion is a set of established rules and rituals that govern how adherents should interact with whatever deity the religion focuses on (if there is one, more, or any at all), the world around them, and how they should live their lives.  A religion can be widespread, organized under a world office (think the Vatican for Catholics), or can only be practiced by a single adherent if they take the time to make their own personal one (what I did, and no, no one else can join it).

Spirituality, despite ""spirit"" in the word, has little if anything to do with actual spirits themselves, and you can have one without them.  Interacting with spirits can, however, be included in spirituality, just as it can in religion.  Let me see if I can explain this correctly, even if the article did a fair job of it already.  Spirituality is a sense of community with literally everything in the world around you, or universe, depending on how big you're going.  People who practice spirituality are cultivating that sense of community.  Some people who practice religion can practice spirituality while doing it.  Some people who practice spirituality might find themselves wandering into a religion because it helps their cultivation of the aforementioned sense of community.  Some people who practice spirituality might find themselves creating their own religion (like I did), and some of those people might choose to share it with others (which I will not).  There are also people who follow an individual's spirituality as though it were a religion.

Religion, as first developed by humans, was a way for our ancestors to explain their natural environment, attempt to harness it, or otherwise feel more in control of it.  It was also helpful in governing groups of people, and encouraging them to function as a community.  We humans seek a higher power by nature, as evidenced by an infant instinctively looking to its mother for its every need.  This doesn't mean we are all required to be religious or even spiritual our whole lives.  We don't need our mothers to wipe for us as adults, after all (there's breathing room in this for various conditions where an adult would need that kind of care, but I won't go there here).

Science is a way of objectively measuring, observing, and explaining the world around us so we feel more in control.  Communities form around science, and it also governs how we interact with the world around us, eachother, how we live our lives, and even how we interact (or not) with deity (if we believe in deity in the first place).  Sound familiar?

Whether someone sees a sense of deity in science or spirituality doesn't really matter.  Deity is more common in religion, but not strictly required.  That doesn't matter, either.

Humans are communal by nature, we are wired to seek eachother out and (generally) remain in groups.  We've been doing all of the above since we first started doing them; it's not too much of a stretch to think there might be a grey area between science and the other two.

And people REALLY need to re-think where psychology fits in.  Psychological activity happens in the mind, the brain is generally understood to be the container the mind is in, and the brain is in the body.  There are some people who believe the mind is contained within the entire person's physical body since the brain pretty much operates everything else while depending on it for its continued existence, but I won't go there more than I already have.  Stress had your shoulders and neck tense long enough to where you need to take painkillers regularly because it still hurts after the stressor is gone?  Feel a burst of warmth in your chest that spreads everywhere when your partner smiles at you after a long day of working kept you apart?  Those and every other one like them are evidence enough until science catches up.

Religion, spirituality, and science hold varying degrees of importance to various different people.  If a human, as a communal creature, doesn't feel enough of a sense of community with only their fellow humans, they might either get a pet, take up a religion, take up a spirituality, or reach for other ways for their ""community needs"" to be met.  If a human's ""community needs"" aren't met over a significant length of time, said human might develop mental illness (depression and anxiety are two common ones).

The biggest problem with this article (the parts I've read anyways), is that the author, unfortunately, sucks at getting the point across objectively.  Mystical experience and spiritual intelligence, while generally accurate, don't correctly illustrate the point.  ""Mystical experience"" implies that it must be something that is firmly supernatural, or of something divine; that it can't by nature be something normal/ordinary/mundane.  ""Spiritual intelligence"" implies that spirituality is something that must be learned, rather than a function of evolution to preserve the species.  It can, however, be re-learned.  There are as many ways of re-learning it as there are humans living.

A better way to frame the article would be ""New psychology research links spiritual experience to heightened sense of community with everything.""  Compare that with the original, and it brings the subject matter down to earth more, makes it closer to ordinary.  Simpler.

If these are spiritual experiences, then wouldn't knowledge/insights retained from these experience work toward ""spiritual intelligence""?. 

Granted, ""spritiual"" is a world that is quickly becoming like ""God"" in that it invokes a highly skeptical reaction. But I don't think it is very complicated. 

Understanding or knowledge in this world doesn't seem to be just only about the ideas we hold, it's also about seeing what we are in relation to those ideas, and if you have taken steps in the ""spiritual"" journey as it were (such as meditation and that kind of thing) then eventually you come to a point in which coming to truth or simply self, ideas have to be left behind. Mainly because if you relate to self through an idea, you are staying in a sense of duality to do so. These experience (especially psychedelic) wash a wave through the whole game, and to see what was once a sturdy reality now washed away like a castle made of sand is tantamount to a miracle, albeit a phenomenological miracle (a kind of change in perception thought not to be possible by the experiencing agent). 

The real issue is being able to convey this spiritual intelligence to another. I suspect it can't really, and the best we can do is accept altered states of consciousness as legit ways to gain insight into the nature of self and from that facilitate these experiences with forms of ritual as they have always been. This is already happening, of course, as the dust settles from the 60s, more scientific research is being done on psychedelic drug research, legilisation/decriminisation with more exposure to culture.

I recently read Scattered Minds by Dr. Gabor Maté, and he emphasized the necessity of having some sort of spiritual understanding, may it be as complex as religious following or as simple as yoga or meditation, as it provides purpose and moral principles in a fluctuating world while also developing self-insight through a filter of spirit and soul. The study of the spirit has been consistent throughout human history, it’s not something that should be disregarded as hogwash, especially considering the majority of the world is at least somewhat religious or spiritual (which appears in various forms, from Buddhism, Islam, Native American spiritual traditions, voodoo, Japanese folk traditions, and much more.). It’s actually a relatively new and mostly-European based perspective to consider spirituality as an archaic concept. 
Based on my personal experience, finding spirituality was probably one of the best things to ever happen to me. It gave me a reason to live, and enhanced my life tenfold. I recommend at least considering some sort of spiritual understanding.",1647748021.0,-5

Similarly, happiness is vague, but there are several metrics to approximate happiness. And so on. And if there's one leading metric, it terms to become synonimical with the term in everyday language, like intelligence with IQ.

From another realm, happiness also has its own happiness index that is used to write articles [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ti05fc/the_worlds_happiest_countries_for_2022_8_out_of/).

I don't think we're going to hash this all out here because we are at best tangential to the original topic at this point (the ""spiritual"" intelligence Garner originally proposed wasn't philosophy-- he proposed existential intelligence for that-- and I think we agree it is a junk concept anyways). Nonetheless, let me give an alternate explanation with a controversial statement: science, like religion, is less rigorous than philosophy.

See, scientific consensus is possible because of certain, untestable base assumptions: specifically around epistemology and empiricism. (Now you called out $5 words, so I'll add that epistemology is how you can know what you know is true and empiricism is the belief that knowledge can be derived from sensory experience). There is, objectively, no way to test those base assumptions-- imagine an experiment to prove that experiments are valid. It is an unreconcilable paradox.

Now analytical means using logical reasoning. It is not about experience or experimentation-- analysis is logic. While you may be uncomfortable with moving past the base assumption of empiricism, base assumptions are not logical, they are convenient. You will see more variety in the arguments of philosophers because philosophy is not bound to any specific set of assumptions. What derives from those base assumptions must be bound by reason, or we've abandoned philosophy and moved on to mysticism.

This is why I compared science and religion in the original statement. They can be rigorous and analytical up to one point-- challenging their base assumptions. The argument you frame between statements of ethics being objective or subjective is a good case in point-- you have to make a base assumption to get at either position. What you do with that base assumption is what determines whether you are making a valid argument.

Listen to academic philosophers critique philosophical arguments that deal with their own center of expertise (you wouldn't listen to your average geneticist talk about geology either). They will analyze whether the argument made supports the assumption being proven. To say that that analysis is, well, not as analytical as a chemist analyzing whether a sample supports the hypothesis of an experiment is a simple misunderstanding of what the word ""analysis"" means.",1647753861.0,5

It’s a bit Occam’s razor. 

There’s maybe another term in philosophy that better encapsulates it, but it’s way easier to say “these experiences are typical, and therefor not divine” as opposed to “these experiences are typical and exemplary of the divine.” The mundane is common. The divine is not, by definition, so you’ve elevated the burden of evidence against yourself if that’s your argument.

I think it's more the concept of there being a god existing is the evidence. Whether there's absolute proof or not, one accepts that it exists in some capacity. 

For example i dont believe in god. I dont think god has any kind of direct or real nfluence over people. God isnt an authority i recognize even to the point that i absolutely refuse to capitalize the word in most cases (grammar allowing it). However i refuse to say god isnt real as well. The concept and the possibility of god existing affects human culture, beliefs, morals. It can change people's emotions, comfort or cause discomfort. So real or imagined, in some capacity god exists. I accept that. I am fine with it. I am even happy for it since it makes for good stories in fantassy. Doesnt really have consequences on my day to day life, but it's interesting.

Frankly i have a similar relationship with astronomy. I cant tangibly calculate or observe celestial bodies like an astronomer or astro-physicist would. But ive read a bit on it, ive listened to astronomers talk about it, i can see the stars in the skies. It all seems beautiful, intangible and ephemereal to me, much like a dream, yet i somehow manage to just accept that it's real. Doesnt really have consequences in my day to day life, it's just interesting.

That said people who swallow religious dogma, the fanatics and zealots arent being spiritual. At that point it's just automated blind faith since that's all you know, or it serves your selfish purposes or you do it out of fear. At that point i call it mental illnesses and ignorance

Tall order. I can't ever prove that any other person experiences any of that, because I'm limited to my own experiences. Your brain and the experiential phenomena that it samples  through your nervous system, then collects and stores in an extremely compressed format that we call a ""memory"", are entirely your own until you die.

The 0.5% of coal fly ash that escapes the particulate precipitators installed on coal plant smokestacks amounts to a release of some 801 tons of Uranium (including 5.5 tons of U-235) and 2,630 Curies of radiation in 1982 alone.

So, nearly 600 times as much Uranium and 57 times as much Radiation were being released annually by Coal plants at the time of the Church Rock incident. 

Since there were about 150 Coal plants in operation at the time, each individual plant was responsible for releasing 4 times as much Uranium and a third as much radiation as Church Rock every single year.

(The temporal proximity of this study's data to the Church Rock incident is just a happy accident.)

That's why there are plans on file, for every interstate highway bridge, to blow it up quickly and completely. Demolition plans have to be part of the submitted design, and they have to be approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers before it's built.

Obviously that's a whole different thing from storing explosives in the bridge all the time, but it's still pretty cool. The plans are very specific.

Tasteless joking aside the bacterias are an important part of how Swiss Cheese holes are formed. 

>Three types of bacteria are used in the production of Swiss cheese: Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus (also known as Streptococcus thermophilus), Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus helveticus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus), and Propionibacterium (Propionibacterium freudenreichii subspecies shermani). In a late stage of cheese production, the propionibacteria consume the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria and release acetate, propionic acid, and carbon dioxide gas. **The carbon dioxide slowly forms the bubbles that develop the ""eyes"".**

In fact when the amount of holes in Swiss cheese started decreasing the Swiss Cheese producers had to start hiring scientists to find out what makes the holes.

They test shot an encyclopedia beforehand but book was propped against a solid wall and the bullet never pierced the book. They didn’t understand the physics of conservation - the book and wall can act as one object like a very reinforced book. During stunt he held the book midair, which if the book was in midair, the .50 cal bullet would have certain passed through the book like nothing.

edit: conservation of momentum and conservation of energy are the physics laws involved. the same laws are seen in a Newton's cradle. the bullet is both pushing and tearing the target (elastic and inelastic). the heavier the target, the more impulse energy is used up pushing the object and there is less energy to tear into the target.

I'm a little confused about how 30 people in rural MN didnt realize the danger of a deagle through a small book.

If they get clogged or somehow don't expand, they will pass right through, acting like a full metal slug. Or the partial jackets can get stripped and pass through.

A man accidentally shot dead his wife while trying to install a TV satellite system in his bedroom.
Ronald Long had been unable to punch a hole through one of his exterior walls in Missouri, U.S.

So he used his .22 calibre handgun to fire two shots into the wall to make a hole big enough for a cable to run through from the outside satellite dish.

Tragically his wife Patsy, 34, who was standing outside the house was hit.

If anyone had asked me I would've assumed a thick book would have enough mass compared to a bullet that it wouldn't matter whether or not the book was allowed to move, since the fraction of momentum the bullet retains is basically the ratio of their masses.

It's obviously a pointlessly dangerous idea to shoot a gun at someone but he probably used a reasonable line if thinking to ""make sure"" it was safe before getting shot at. Maybe he thought:

 • Books or coins in people's pockets stop bullets in movies

 • Bulletproof vests work on a similar principle and are perfectly capable of preventing death

 • If I can find a thick enough book, maybe I can use it to block a bullet

 • I got a thick book and shot it with a small gun, it only damaged a few pages

 • I got a bigger gun and shot the thickest book I have, and it only went in 1/4"" into the 1.5"" book (I'm just speculating here)

 • This book is six times thicker than needed to stop a bullet, so even if there were any small variations the book is going to be virtually 100% effective at stopping bullets

 • If the gun is shot at me, the only way I'll die is if it misses the book

 • Shooting the book point-blank makes it impossible to miss

 • This would be a sick YouTube video

#Additional additional fun fact!!!: 

At the time that Poe died it was not uncommon to find dead people on the streets reeking of alcohol. This was because there were several people who, when voting time came around, would go to bars, find a local drunk, and use them. By that I mean take them to the polls, have them vote for someone then take them , dress them in different clothes and then have them vote again , then repeat, repeat, repeat.

I haven't heard about how successful they were, but Ethiopia was planning to put in 7 billion trees in a third round of afforestation last year. Even sharing a billion of those with its neighboring countries.  With the war in Tigray I hope it still happened and the trees aren't being wiped out.",1647782421.0,5

People didn't just need it for heating the furnaces but they also required the mineral [natron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natron#Importance_in_antiquity) that was obtained from the wood to produce the glass. 

That's why glass factories traditionally were in the densest forests, like the Bavarian Forest. Workers cut down as many trees around the factory as they could. Once it wasn't profitable anymore the whole factory [moved to another place.](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldglas#Waldglash%C3%BCtte)

>Because of their high consumption of wood, they also had important tasks in the development of the state and forestry. **When the forest was cut down, the forest glass works migrated to more and more distant, uninhabited areas up to the high valleys, and with them all the entourage that got employment through them went with them.**

>At that time, about 1 cubic meter of wood was needed to produce 1 kg of glass. The wood requirement of a single glassworks for the production of potash and for heating the glass furnaces was 2000 to 3000 cubic meters of wood annually, which corresponds to an amount of about 3000 to 5000 cubic meters. For a glassworks, the wood supply of about 20 to 30 hectares of forest was needed annually. **80 to 85% of the wood was incinerated to obtain potash. Already in the 14th century there were complaints about the devastation of the forest by the glassworks;** for example, in the Spessart, there were never more than 10 forest glassworks in operation at the same time. For the landlord, however, a glassworks was the most lucrative way to exploit his forest.

>Farmers and cattle breeders could be settled in the abandoned dwellings, who in turn produced food on the deforested areas and thus further promoted growth. A traveling glassworks was able to prepare entire forests for settlement, farm after farm, settlement after settlement. In some areas, firing glass furnaces with wood was banned as early as the 17th century (England 1615, Bohemia 1650), which heralded the end of forest glassworks. 

It made a lot of money (at least for rulers and those who owned the forests) but it also destroyed a lot of the environment. 

It's also remarkable how a lot of people today think that in 18th/19th century, in the time before industrialization, there was mostly ""untouched nature"" in Europe. This is partly because of [Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) which helped shape this idea.
