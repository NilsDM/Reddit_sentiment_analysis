Same colors and markings of a corgi, usual long pointy ears of a corgi... And of course, long and short body like a jenga piece, with the trademark corgi butt too...

It does look like its face was smooshed in a little in the PS process unless it's just a weirder-looking corgi, and since chihuahuas tend to have a short stubbier muzzle (among their many other differences like body shape, hair length, tail, shorter wider ears, etc) maybe that's why it is resembling it more than it should? 

With all of the other differences, it is still pretty much impossible to mistake this for anything but a corgi. Even if you straight up put a chihuahua head on it, only a corgi has that butt and shape there. LOL",1647967739.0,3

Furthermore there is also the ideological impact of the individual between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.

The fetus tested positive for [Edwards Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_syndrome). Just given those test results, the chance of a live birth dropped to 5 percent. Assuming the baby was born, the median life expectancy was measured in days. Likely disabilities include kidney malformations, structural heart defects at birth, intestines protruding outside the body, esophageal atresia, intellectual disability, developmental delays, growth deficiency, feeding difficulties, breathing difficulties, and arthrogryposis. (Skimming Wikipedia, apparently results have got better since we dealt with this, but still nothing like good quality of life.) So she had the abortion. It was a relatively easy decision as these things go. 

That was her first pregnancy. The second one was healthy. Our daughter is in school at the moment. She's tiring and often annoying, but in age-appropriate ways. If my wife didn't have the abortion, we probably wouldn't have had her. We might not have been able to, the first pregnancy could have caused health problems, and we might not have wanted to, given the expense and trauma we would have gone through. When abortion bans are in the news, I often think, ""If that had been the law for us, our daughter wouldn't be alive.""",1647957670.0,355

I grew up with a sister who was held back at birth. Her highest measurable IQ is 2 years 6 months at feeding herself . She is in her mid/late 60s now.
No one in our very large family had a normal childhood. We all had to watch her and take care of her. She’s older than me, but I still had to take care of her toilet needs and I often had to clean up floors, furniture and laundry, plus her, when I wasn’t even a teenager yet. As I was closest in age, it fell to me to be her caregiver and eventually her guardian. A large part of my life has been devoted to her. I knew very early on that I would never want to give birth to a mentally challenged kid. I lived in fear that my own child would be held back and end up oxygen deprived and be like her. I never had a clue what a real childhood should be until I got a lot older. I often think how different the lives of my siblings, parents and myself would be, had she been born as a “normal” person. I could never willingly give birth to a mentally disabled person and mess the lives of my other kids and my spouse up so drastically.

I check in on them on social from time to time and see pictures of what life would have been like for us and the child in that same house. Seeing their beautiful son makes me feel terrible.

I love these kids, but seeing some kid with no ability to move any part of their body or even look like their heads are about to explode with tears coming from their eyes with no ability to yell ""HELP ME FROM THIS"", just fucking kills me.

I will not throw any shade at people for their decisions, whether it is to abort, to raise and love, to ask the state to care for such a child. It is complicated and personal.

But me? As a witness to all that, I have spicy opinions.

Over the course of 15 years I witnessed that family get absolutely wrecked. Parents never ever ever happy, older brother defacto caregiver, resentful because his life suffering, all plans for college and retirement fucked by absurd medical costs of caring for the special needs child. On summer days when the windows were open we could hear them all arguing and yelling at each other, always about her. 

On top of that was the usual stuff of her getting bullied in the neighborhood, or at school. And constant medical problems. I would characterize her life as mostly suffering and mental distress. And the entire fact that most everyone feels school is pointless for such a person and that anyone doing that kind of thing is ""foolish"" and ""wasting time"" (not my opin)

The child unceremoniously died to a respiratory infection right around the time i was entering college. Which fucked them up even more, because although it was 15 years of thankless nonstop work, now they didn't have to do 15 more years of that. They exhibited clear signs of survivor guilt. 

Parents eventually divorced, house got sold, older brother moved away. They all had permanent frazzly hair, frowns, drab shitty clothes. All in all, I think even the most relentless optimist would have a hard time pulling a silver lining out of that. Those people got dealt a SUPER SHITTY hand from life.

I watched my nephew suffer for 8 years. He was ok (as in content) for the first few years- he loved lights and colors, and because he couldn’t walk, he was obsessed with feet (he would roll on the floor, and my dad lowered his fish tank for him- it was his favorite) and we all wore funny socks and slippers and oh my god, his laughter when my sister would wear these slippers of reindeers with bells on them. It was a musical laugh, very happy. He had a feeding tube, and loved cuddles. Sweet baby, but always a baby, even at 50 lbs. very hard on my sister, bc his dad left as soon as my nephew was diagnosed (3 months). But as my nephew’s illness progressed, so did his pain. By the end, he was in pain 24/7. He was a child (really, a baby, bc even though he was 8, he didn’t have an 8 year old’s mental capacity), and all he knew was pain. I couldn’t do that to a person if I could prevent it. My sister had no idea he was disabled when she was pregnant, btw. I don’t know what she would’ve done if she had known, but she didn’t, all tests were normal. He died at home, he had seizure after seizure, and eventually either he stopped breathing or his heart stopped. They don’t know which happened first. My sister has (obviously) never been the same.

He is VERY fortunate to be in a position where he has a lot of love, attention, and access to resources but I firsthand know the emotional and financial toll it takes on my parents although you wouldn't know it because they really do love and don't resent him.

You lose a lot of independence and flexibility because EVERYTHING you do has to work around them. Nonetheless, my parents have made it work and I think they're one of the better examples of this situation. They didn't know that he had down syndrome before he was born.

The other consequence that I haven't seen talked about is the outcome of redirecting most of your attention to one child instead of equally spreading it across all children. I come from a relatively big family, and because my brother required a lot of attention, I do believe it negatively affected me and my other siblings. I don't resent my parents though because I understand that my brother needs a lot of attention. I did wish they stopped having kids after my brother but it is what it is (I'm the eldest).

We always had to lock the doors growing up because my brother would run away. He had no sense of fear, no sense of danger. He enjoyed running around, sometimes would jump into pools. Even though I don't live with my parents anymore, it's become ingrained in me to check all the doors at my home, several times throughout the day because I would have to do it all the time as a child. I don't think this is a huge deal, but it's to give you an idea of something I still deal with today.

Even though I have the financial means, I don't want to lose that kind of independence in my life, also it's incredibly stressful. My brother also has seizures, although it has gotten better due to legal access to CBD oil.

I sometimes have trouble sleeping because I don't want my parents to pass on before he does. I will help him no matter what, but you can't explain to him why mom and dad aren't around anymore.

Either way, I love my brother to death and am always ready to help him in any shape or form. I'll always be here for him and my parents.

We go home, wife takes it easy for a few days but it doesn’t seal, there’s nothing that can be done surgically and we have to induce. Our little girl fought to the end but she was stillborn. Had she survived the odds were in her favour but we’ll never know. The staff were so supportive, we okayed an autopsy for research purposes, medically and genetically she was perfect, the only thing they could come up with was that her finger nail nicked the amniotic sack and the leakage was enough to prevent it sealing itself.",1647943889.0,149

Not a day goes by I don’t think of that child. I still look at the ultrasound photos from time to time, remembering a life that could have been. 

But as far as I’m concerned, we saved that child. As a disabled person myself, the thought of experiencing the traumas of life without all the resources and facilities I’ve been afforded is chilling. Some people say it’s because the parents don’t want to have a life of pain, or because it will become some burden. But for us, we just didn’t want to bring a life into a world that can be so cruel. The pain. The rage. The dependency. If I could spare any creature that, I would. Especially my child. It was a short life, only experiencing the comfort of their mother’s womb before they faded away into painless oblivion.

My hild was born with a severe and terminal skin condition that made her suffer beyond imagination. Many children with her level of disease are skinned alive through natural birth. She spent months in isolation at a top hospital. During her life she had to have countless surgeries, including two to replace her esophagus with pieces of her colon to keep it open. 
Her fingers fused together despite the best treatment. She was unable to extend her leg fully due to scars, had to have a support dog to help interrupt the pain every single time she used the bathroom. She couldn't eat solid food or attend school. She never ran or played. 
The pain from a dog licking a baby's face is enough to prompt them to stand and walk to avoid further pain. 
Of the children who reach puberty, they can look forward to their many scars becoming cancerous.

And this is coming from someone who has struggled with the morality of the issue for a while.  I think abortion is wrong.  You're ending a human life before it's had the chance to start.  I don't think it should be illegal, but I think people need to be given the chance to really think about it before they do it. 

 Barring three things -- Rape, complications threatening the life of the mom, and severe birth defects, I think it should be pretty hard to get an abortion.  

For those three things I don't think it should even be an issue.
  
- We don't live in caveman times and rape should not have to to result in the rapist's chromosomes being passed on, nor the mother forced to raise it.
- Unless the mother really wants it, she shouldn't have to risk her life to have a baby.  
- Finally, with people having fewer kids later in life, the opportunity for life and success should be given to someone who isn't going to create a lifetime of hardship for themselves and their parents through no fault of their own, simply by being unlucky when the genes were shuffled.

Depending on your personal views, you very likely disagree with me about some portion of this.  Feel free to tell me about it if you need to.  I ask that you keep it respectful.  I know I've said things that are probably offensive to people, especially if you've grown up with disabilities or have a family member with disabilities whom you love.

We had a very rich, super charity driven family in my hometown who had a son with a severe disability and they basically fell of the face of the planet caring for him. They canceled plans for her to open a tanning salon. They had a houseboat, a Ferrari and a bunch of toys (dirt bikes and stuff) but they were all sold to pay for the medical expenses. He sold his gun collection his father had built up and thats where I got my first shotgun. He sold his business for half its worth when the kid turned 3. the kid died at 4 anyways and then they were a scarred couple in their late 30s with only their house and 2 cars left. The dad is doing better now and went back to work for the guy who bought his business, but the mom hasn't recovered socially. If that baby only makes it a couple weeks or months, this couple doesn't lose everything they built up in the last 1.5 decades. Now they probably have to pay off medical debt for a few years before they get right financially. They were wealthy with a very bright future that was ruined by a birth defect. 

Sorry I don't remember what the baby had and I don't feel comfortable asking anyone what it was. No one talks about it anymore.",1647959011.0,151

My sister has a rare, but mild form of cerebral palsy. She can feed herself and talk and walk. She can do a number one in the toilet and a number two, but doesn't know how to clean it up; and often has accidents. She can remember basic things, colors, numbers, she can count to 10. She can slap back with some sarcastic comments, and when she does it shocks me haha. Sometimes she has seizures, and it renders her unable to walk or move for a good hour or so, and leaves her weak.  She's 25. I feel terrible for my mom, who had to grow up with a disabled daughter and be a full time caretaker. Mom has never got to live out her life, essentially being stuck with my sister forever. I grew up being a part time caretaker, cause mom was young and wanted to go out on weekends with her friends. 

My mom signed up for a program that actually pays her to be my sister's full time caretaker - and this same program allows someone else in the family to get paid and watch her for a few hours every week - so mom gets a break to go out and run errands and do shopping, or get her nails done, etc.  She gets paid more being a stay-at-home caretaker/mom than she did at her old accounting job. I highly recommend the program to anyone reading this that may need it. 

California - [IHSS Program](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/in-home-supportive-services)

West Virginia and Wyoming - [IDD Wavier](https://www.fmrs.org/idd)

Other states may have similar programs but these are the ones I am familiar with.

My mom always told me if God didn't think she could handle a disabled child he wouldn't have given her one.  I don't personally know if I can handle it, but I do know that once my mom passes, I will be taking care of my sister, and it's a terrifying thought. It scares to me to the core. I love her so much, I would do anything for her. I'm trying to work hard to get myself in a good position financially, so that when the time comes, I can afford to have a nurse help out - because I know I won't be able to handle it full time.

My brother-in-law has cerebral palsy but it is a sever form, he can chew food and do some basics like grab a stimulus toy when you place it right next to him but he spends his entire life sitting on the floor in front of the TV. When he uses the bathroom, his mother lifts him up like a sack of potatoes and carries him to the toilet then she wipes his ass. He has physical therapy multiple times a week but going anywhere is very laborious. Currently aged 26 he has a very... youthful set of interests (big explosion movies, daytime tv).

His mother is a saint. But there is no relief for her because we can't afford it. Watching her I now know how much care like she gives should be compensated, but the only person who can do it is her since she can't ever find a job to work that would pay for full time care and the rest of the bills. Looking at them, I just see an anchored existence. There is no escape, like ever. Even if she could get away for a vacation how would you feel if you left to get a break from your disabled child and they died? What does it say to him when you want to vacation without him? What good is he getting from his life when (as far as I can tell) he may not even be able to fully express himself or understand his feelings?

My brother is mentally disabled. He is “high functioning” but hasn’t always been that way.

If I wasn’t helping him get ready for school, cooking breakfast for the family, getting him to take a shower (ugh teenagers with mental disabilities are rough) I was organizing meds or just trying to get my own laundry done. 

As an adult my parents have done decently for themselves but we’re financially crippled early for years while paying off medical bills. They had to push retirement back and back. My parents have never been on a vacation in almost 40 years that didn’t involve just driving to their parents. My brother doesn’t require 24/he care but requires 24/supervision. He is and will perpetually be a 10-12 year old. Is it the worst situation? No, far from it. But holy shit, it doesn’t just change your life as a parent it changes your families life. 

As a sibling, you grow up fast. You know everything about his meds, finances, and behavior problems. You have to be invested in your parents finances and wills because you are the one that will be taking care of him when your parents die. 

Think about that for a second. When your parents die you won’t have time to grieve. Why? Because you now have a 10-12 yo child in a 60yo body that requires immediate attention. 

Did I delay having kids until I was better financially? Absolutely. Was I happy when my wife because pregnant? Of course! But was constantly worried my baby would have disabilities. We did all the genetic testing but even that doesn’t stop seizures from turning your baby’s brain into a potato at anytime.

I have three kids, all teens now.  They have no developmental issues.  I've been spared this question in my own life.  But, there's a part of me that wonders if we leave the realm of obvious disabilities that will cause short lives of pain for the children or demand non-stop care even after the parents are gone, and move into hassle issues, like a child that would be born needing a transplant or a child that would have asthma, do we draw a line?  

I less concerned with the religious ramifications; we pretty much all know how they feel on any abortion.  I'm more interested in whether or not society could seek to limit a woman's right to choose.  I don't think we should, but there are certainly issues of technology eventually getting to the point (say in 100+ years) where we could know whether a child would be amazing, and then selectively abort fetuses until we get the exact kind of baby we want.  At that point, is it still about a woman's corporal sovereignty?  What if a hardline government were to make it so that babies had to be 'designer'? 

These issues are fascinating.  When we were having kids, we were religious and likely would not have.  Now that we aren't, I don't know what my wife would've done.  I think I would've thought about it long and hard.

Mental hospitals were rightly criticized back in the day, but instead of changing the way they worked, we pretty much just got rid of them, and now there are very few options for people who need residential levels of care.

The problem there is that in-home help usually costs A LOT more.  So people who need residential care are being given haphazard in-home care, which means there's less assistance available for folks who are genuinely at the level where they/their parents just need in-home care.

If parents of autistic kids with high care needs had someone who came in for a couple hours a couple days a week to help with things and give the parents ""breaks"", like being able to go grocery shopping by themselves, that could make a huge difference in caregiver burn out.

But qualifying for those types of assistance are so difficult and take a huge fight that so many families that could really benefit from that don't have the chance unless they are wealthy and can privately pay for it.

Before our first was born, you get that question: do you want to do genetic testing? No, we didn’t. If the child had an issue we were still going to be their parents, we said. They urged us to consider children with severe disabilities and we said let it be. Our child was born and all seemed well. We were blessed.

Then came number two. And number three. And number four.

And as they grew, it became super clear that one and two were physically fine, but had severe behavioral issues. Family and friends became distanced as we tried to figure this out without their unsolicited advice (“beat their asses” was common). Diagnosis: severe ADHD and all the opposition, impulsivity and irritation that comes with it.

It’s been hard. Some days are better than others but finding the right mix of routine, medication and therapy has been helpful. Dad is now out of the picture. He is still local but he chooses when and where he wants to see them all (I keep it informal and open access to promote their relationship). He supports the family financially but in so many ways has ‘checked out’ and become a Disney Dad. He is aware of all their educational, behavioral and medical challenges but there is minimal involvement in that. It all rides on me.

He loves them all very, very much but it’s just too much sometimes. There are days he makes a quick getaway. Is it hard holding it all together, on my own, with no local support system? Yes. But as they get older it gets a tiny bit easier. They are learning control, even if there are only small victories — it’s more than we had when they were toddlers. They’re all good kids, I’m blessed.

I do consider, though— I have no idea what I would have done with a severely disabled child. I have friends with such children and it’s just all-consuming. My two are only special needs and it takes so much from all us to help them.",1647962171.0,10

One, I think bodily integrity outweighs everything else, up to the point of viability. I don't think it's appropriate to force anyone to continue a pregnancy given it is not a riskless condition. Women still die due to pregnancy, childbirth and post-partum complications. They still suffer health affects, pain and psychological issues. They are still unprotected by law and can be fired from their job, possibly leaving them unable to support themselves, if they cannot continue their current duties. We seem to value bodily integrity so much that even the dead get to choose whether they donate organs to save a life. But somehow living women should have someone else decide what their body goes through? Bonkers.  

Two, for circumstances past viability, I think it has to come down to whether or not the state has the appropriate funding and staffing to care for disabled children 24/7 for the rest of their lives in a humane way. We don't have that system currently, and I don't see the politics there to actually put it in place. Leftists are still struggling with conservatives over keeping healthy, impoverished children fed. Just fed. And that is a lot less expensive than around-the-clock care.

But, assuming like you say, he has no learning difficulties or disabilities this will pass.


At the very least he will go to school and be in the social environment he likely needs to unlearn and re learn behaviours instilled due to the nature of covid and lock downs etc. 


I doubt you have the mental capacity or energy to consider to much to relearn at home! But if you can , or you have support who you can lean on it could be worth trying to set small boundaries? 


 I'm not sure exactly the circumstances of ""overly attached"" or his age but can you start coaching some independence in with a small task like putting his own pajamas on at bedtime? Or washing himself at bath time? Is he old enough to  eat solid food like a yogurt with his own spoon? 


Just little things you can build on - well you managed to put your top on yesterday, I reckon you do the bottoms today as well!


It sounds like you both go to bed at the same time? Obviously I've no idea what your schedule is and changing bedtime habits can be very challenging. But post his bed time and pre yours should really be several hours of you time to decompress. Is he going late or do you need to go early for work? 


Depending on his age young kids are often extremely eager to help out or appear grown up especially if you ham up your own ""ineptitude"" at stuff like loading a washing machine. Combined with the learning centre he's at that helping him with socialising with kids you may be able to slowly wean him into some independence and give yourself some breathing space. 


You're not selfish for wanting time to yourself. You're not selfish for setting boundaries around time or activities you want to be child free. 
Nor are you a terrible person for harbouring some resentment. Particularly off the back of having a young child through COVID - nobody went into having kids expecting to be locked down or have severely reduced social opportunities for two years, particularly during the most developmentally important part of a babies life. I imagine raising a kid hasn't exactly met your expectations given those circumstances and hating that is normal. 


Kids can be awesome and raising them (generally!) Pays off long term in terms of enjoyment and enrichment.

They had a blog about their child and how sick he was, how he couldn't walk and needed a feeding tube, how they needed to raise money for his treatment.

A few months after I met the guy, there was a story in the local paper about how the child had been taken away from him by CPS because the doctors at the children's hospital reported them for medical abuse. They had been shopping around for doctors who would do unneeded procedures, then post about it on social media. The kid didn't need a feeding tube and could walk.

I have *very* strong feelings about this.

Why does the parent get to decide for whatever reason that that life *has* to be lived? If you abort, then that’s that. There never is any suffering, and this stupid fucking fairytale of “a missed life” doesn’t apply because you are destroying a fetus. You are not taking anything away from anyone (the person that would have been born I mean) because it wasn’t there yet in the first place.

She also bit people. Probably not on purpose, but still. Very tough to get along with someone like that.

This is awful, and awfully familiar.

I had a closer relationship with a pet dog than my barely-verbal but still physically active sister.  Caring for her dominated my childhood household until she was finally institutionalized as a teenager with the mind of a profoundly autistic 15-month-old.  On what visits we still have, she doesn't seem to recognize me anymore, as her sibling or as a person to communicate with directly.  Her minimal vocabulary has also drifted over time in pronunciation when speaking at her father, and we can barely recognize even the most basic verbal cues (""Cookie."" ""Cheese."" ""Bathroom."").  While nonverbal tantrums (with self-harm) or elation is obvious enough, anything more fine-grained than that has been lost.  Maybe her caretakers are better at this now, but that rotating cast of recent inductees into the American healthcare system are... not great, by all indications.

The state is in charge of her now in a formal legal sense, but apparently a bureaucratic conflict has permitted them to completely deny her dental care (for which she has to be restrained and sedated), so even decades after terminating legal guardianship, thousands of dollars a year go into that; I don't know if I'm expected to pick that up when my parents die, or what.  I don't know that I'll even visit somebody who doesn't understand that I exist.

It's difficult to communicate to others that the concepts of humanity and personhood are tightly linked, but not synonymous.  People are social entities that communicate, maintain some memory and agency with regard to the world around them, and enter into relationships where they have reciprocal roles and obligations.  You can't really interact on a meaningful level with a human being who doesn't rise to this threshold.

If the father is a carrier, and the mother is not, NIPT might be enough to detect it early, but it wouldn't be enough to eliminate the possibility, so there's a whole calculus of probabilities involved.  


I do wonder if it wouldn't be beneficial to design an exhaustive NIPT panel as a default; the risk of complications from NIPT is much lower than from invasive (to the fetus) screening, but placental damage can and on occasion does happen, and it seems like, if that risk is being taken anyway, an exhaustive panel would make it a little more worthwhile.  


One of the rationales for not doing an exhaustive panel is that for extremely rare conditions, false positives can become far more likely than true positives. For this, I think it would be more reasonable to apply more education, and in the case of positive results, adding an invasive screen, rather than not doing the screen in the first place. Even with an exhaustive screen, any false positives are going to be rare, and many can be eliminated by doing an overlay with sequencing on the parents, and most of the rest can be eliminated with an invasive screen. Compared to the cumulative cost of NICU treatment for undetected conditions, this would be relatively minor. Of course, certain ""moral"" positions oppose this because it encourages abortions. I can't comprehend how condemning a child to suffer is moral, but that's how it is.",1647966791.0,35

They use an ultrasound to guide the needle and very carefully avoid touching the fetus itself. They didn’t even come close to puncturing the placenta, which is thoroughly stuck to the side of the womb. Puncturing the amniotic sac can prompt contractions, but for me, the contractions stopped quickly. The risk for infection is never zero for any medical procedure, but in this case it is pretty low.

Genetic testing was not at all common at the time, but my son had a 50/50 chance of inheriting a blood protein that my husband carries. If he had it, he would’ve died a few months before being born, so the test was deemed necessary.

The only people saying it’s a superpower are the people who are (or way more commonly people who are caregivers for) high functioning individuals. You don’t see a lot of posts claiming it’s just ‘being unique’ or a ‘superpower’ from those who have children who can’t speak, regularly self harm due to frustration, aren’t toilet trained, are violent to those around them etc.

I do get why, it’s obviously very very difficult and I can’t imagine the emotions involved with wanting to protect somebody/wanting them to succeed so badly when they have a disorder or disability that stops them from being able to do so in neurotypical society. I also believe we can all make changes to make things easier for people who aren’t neurotypical. But the rhetoric of ‘they’re sooooo amazing’ is just so damaging to people who are low functioning and those who love them. It makes people feel like they can’t vent or be honest about their feelings or their loved ones abilities, and it honestly sometimes even leads people to be anti-medication or anti-adjustment because it’s ‘just who they are’, totally ignoring the fact it could help them.

Like you say, you can address the self-hate and society ignorance without going the other way and pretending it’s all rainbows when it’s not. We just need to be honest about it and accept people with disabilities are still just people with a whole range of abilities, emotions, behaviours etc and just as it doesn’t make them a bad person, it also doesn’t make them a super special magical rainbow person with no bad qualities whatsoever.",1647969485.0,1

Was in my early 30s and had recently gotten out of a bad relationship. I ended up chatting with a girl from okcupid that I thought was very pretty and intelligent. She was a PhD candidate at NYU for Philosophy. 

Our plan was to go to an art show and then a bar after. The art show had free wine, which was a good cost saver for me. But for her, the wine wasn't even close to her appetite. We get to the bar and she IMMEDIATELY orders three shots of whiskey for each of us. An hour later of even more shots, I'm completely blasted. We end up taking a cab back to my place. 

We start getting into it despite both being very drunk. She's aggressive, so she starts riding me on the bed hard. A moment later, she punches me in the face. I shake it off like it was an accident, but the she does it again. And when I say punch, i mean it. It was definitely hard enough to break my nose, though thankfully she didn't.

In any case, I'm really drunk, so I don't react at all. About a minute later, she gets exhausted, rolls off me, and falls asleep instantaneously..

Most of my friends melted away, and I got a lot of judgmental looks. Anyway, so I'm trying to couch-serf and sleeping over with anyone who will allow it. 

Well after about 2 weeks I've tapped out all my friends and I'm sleeping in my car and I get a text at 1:30 in the morning. It's from this senior girl who was drop dead gorgeous. She was lonely and wanted to talk, after about 15 minutes on the phone of hearing her vent about how hard she has it right now. I hear her go wait, you aren't xxx, you are xxx!?! (Another guy with the same first name) 

Then she starts crying because she is complaining to the homeless guy and asks if she can do anything to help me. I just say that I really could use a chocolate milk. She laughs, and she says she can arrange that. 

She tells me where she lives, and luckily I'm able to find it. (Ahh the late 2000s', cell phones but no internet on them haha) 

Well I have to sneak into her house, and once I'm up in her room she hands me a chocolate milk. 

I luckily avoid doing a spit take as she stands up, pulls off her shirt and panties, and gives the sexiest pair of do me eyes I have ever seen. 

At that point my brain no longer has dibs on the blood supply and we go at it. 

We laid there cuddling for a bit, and she says I have to get out of there before her parents wake up. 

So I sneak back out, and back down to my car. 

We never spoke of that night to anyone, and I only saw her a couple times around school before she graduated. 

I never did get a chance to tell her that that night probably saved my life. So Brittany if you remember hooking up with an underclassmen back in '07. Thank you. Oh and the chocolate milk was delicious too haha.",1647948491.0,2201

After a shift of delivering pizza I find that a snap was sent out of her riding a dildo. I ask if she's open for me to come over. I doubt it. Go to Waffle House to get my dinner and think it'll just fizzle. But no, she messages back, gives me an address, and I'm off into the boondocks for some fun. The All Star Breakfast rots in the back. It's about 11:30 at night, my phone won't charge, and my GPS guides me onwards. 

After some miscommunication, I find that she lives in a rural property a half hour away. In a trailer off her family's house. I parked my car off to the side of the road, and snuck into the property as her parents were likely sleeping in the house a stone's throw away. Guided by her on the phone, flashlight leading me in. Legally, I probably could have been shot as a trespasser. 

Anyways, we fucked for over a hour among a flock of cats, on a couch inside the dim trailer. Doing just about everything, and indulging her kink for people to bite her, hard.

Half way through the drive, my boss called me and said that the meeting was delayed and to take a week off. I didn't want to drive home to Texas so I continued to Philadelphia to explore for a week. 

I checked into a hotel and drank quite a bit of whiskey before going downstairs to have a cigarette. I saw a gorgeous woman sitting outside having a cigarette as well so I asked if I could sit with her. She was staring at her phone so I tried to make small talk by asking her if she was from the area. It turns out she was Norwegian and just in the States for training. We talked for a while before exchanging instagrams. At that point, her coworker showed up and I excused myself.

I was back in my room completely hammered at this point when she messaged me. I asked her if she wanted to have breakfast the next morning but she was going home. She offered to have drinks instead. We went to a steakhouse right next to the hotel and had a few drinks before going back to the hotel. We had talked about the TV series The Office which she had never seen before so I asked her if she wanted to come watch. It worked!

Two months later, I flew to Oslo to meet her again. And that, ladies and gentlemen is how I met my wife.

Edit:

I'm glad a lot of you enjoyed our story. I did not expect this to get so much attention so here is a bit more info and answers to some questions.

I'm aware this isn't technically a one night stand.

We have been married for 3 years now.

We have both quit smoking cigarettes since then and almost never drink either. Pretty funny imo.

I moved to Norway a short while after we got married.

We are very happy and I'm so thankful to have found such an amazing woman.

I ended up matching with my first person on tinder. They were very interested and asked me out on a first date. We ended up going for dinner and then having sex - half with a condom and then I got my wits together to put one on for a magnitude of reasons. Unfortunately, I was thinking with my penis instead of my brain. She confirmed she was on birth control prior to having sex. After we finished, she was in a hurry to end the night. I assumed I was a rusty partner. 

I ended up ending things after the first date since there was no spark. Turns out, exactly 3 months later she says that she’s pregnant and is going back and forth about an abortion. She ends up not getting the abortion and is sending emotionally charged messages in paragraphs of how I shouldn’t abandon my child. I ended up being such a mess over it all that my appendix exploded the following two weeks when she said that “she was going to take everything I have if I didn’t support our child”. Reminder that I’m a fourth year student in boat loads of student debt and am unemployed. 

I was lucky enough to smarten up and contact a lawyer. I ended up cutting any and all communications to a bare minimum and simply stated that I was not confident that the child was mine.

Next thing I know he posts a video of himself jacking off to my video. *Super hot*. We message a few more times and it turns out we live in different cities in the same small country. His city in particular is pretty close to the major airport. Next time I'm flying out I send him a message and tell him I'll be in his area. I stay overnight in a hotel the night before my flight and we meet up and have a really hot, mostly 69-based, hookup.

We meet for drinks, chat for a while, he's clearly nervous. Once we get a few drinks down though, he awkwardly kisses the back of my head when I had turned to look at something. I said something snarky like ""are you going to kiss me for real at some point?"". He of course does, and the world fucking stops, my heart stops, time stops. We don't stop making out except for long enough to pay, get into and out of the taxi, and get undressed at my place.

We must have had sex five or six times that night. He cuddled me so tightly while he slept. We had sex twice more the next morning. I offer to drive him home, and he accepts.

Turns out I was his second only partner (he was 27), hence the bit of nervousness at first. We had sex more times in that one night than he had ever had lol!

I casually mentioned that I'd like to see him again (sex was hot af, and I genuinely thought he was an interesting dude). He actually texted me a few days later, and we started regularly hooking up.

We go to her place, and as we walk up to the house I realize it’s a friend’s old place and she’s the new tenant. Super weird coincidence. 

Anyway, we go in and look at it, and s he’s normal, she’s extremely cute, has two cute friends over. She invites us to have some drinks, of course we say yes. We’re all getting along, hitting it off and having a great time. A few more drinks go down. One of her friends, who is a stunning Persian girl and I keep making eyes. She seemed to like the fact that I had my bike because she biked too. 

Eventually, my friend goes out to smoke with two of the girls, the Persian girl and I are alone. We look at each other and just instantly start making our, zero hesitation from either of us. 

They come back in and she goes “I need to go but my new friend is going to bike home with me to make sure I get home okay” - sure, message received. 

We get on our bikes to go toward my place and start riding through a field that’s enormously bumpy and both fall down. We’re tanked and have no balance. We start fooling around in the middle of the field before deciding to keep making our way back. 

We end up walking our bikes the short distance back to my apartment and get to it. Her body is spectacular, our chemistry is crazy. I had never eaten ass before but I felt absolutely compelled to. We went for hours, showered, went again. Just one of those magical nights. We part ways hungover but feeling good. 

We’re texting again later - some dirty talk the next weekend while she’s at work. While we were together, she mentioned she always wanted to sleep with a girl but it had never happened. While we’re texting, I told her one of my FWB was bi and that we should initiate her. I’m describing her - name, attributes, body, etc. She stops texting me. I start texting my FWB to tell her about this girl I think she would like. 

An hour or so later, the Persian girl texts, and no shit, she sends a selfie with my FWB - they fucking work together! I have no idea how they broached the conversation but it was absolutely wild to be texting them separately meanwhile they’re both serving in the same restaurant. 

Anyway, I wish I had a conclusion about how this led to a threesome with them but somehow it didn’t, despite the stars aligning?

Turned out she knew the owner of the discotheque where it was held and she got 2 VIP tickets. She was happily to give me one... if i would do her. That night. Before we went there.
I lived very close to the venue, so i picked her up and took her inside.

One of the hottest initiatives i have experienced until this day. Ofcourse it didnt last that long and i think in 10 minutes we were on our way to the party.

We both get crazy drunk, because you know.. VIP so free drinks. 7 hours later in the early morning i drop her off at home and she says her parents are not there. We go inside and i dont know what happened but i hop on my bicycle 3 hours later to go home. We had been tearing eachother apart for the full 3 hours. We never had any clothes on. We took showers, we had food and more drinks. We were constantly touching eachother. There was no end to it (except when i went home). While writing this down i still get a boner when i think about the stuff we did and there was not a sexless moment for more than 2 minutes or so.

She asked if she could come in and she seemed to be nervous and was blushing and kind of looking at the floor and avoiding eye contact with me. I thought something was wrong so I let her in and she sits on my bed and basically after a lot of hesitation she blurts out that she’s always had a huge crush on me since we’d met and that now she was 16 (legal age of consent in the UK) she wanted me to take her virginity right then and there. I thought this was all a joke and that her and my sister had been playing truth or dare or something and that she’d been dared to tell me all this ludicrous stuff. She said it wasn’t a dare and that she was being completely honest with me and explained she’d waited for my sister to go to sleep before coming to my room and she wanted this. I couldn’t believe her and still thought she was lying. There was a lot of back and forth of her saying she wasn’t joking and me not believing her. To prove she was telling the truth she suddenly pulled off her tank top and shorts and just stood naked right in front of me and said “Believe me now?” I asked her if she was truly sure that she wanted to do this and that I didn’t want her to regret her first time because of some silly crush and she responded by pulling my sweat pants down and started sucking my dick. Of course we ended up having sex and then she never told anyone and neither did I. Until now.,1647955134.0,23
1530,AskReddit,What is your craziest one-night stand story?,,1647919683.0,2050,7216,0.91,tecolotesweet,"A while back, I was doing as single dudes do by doing some tinder swiping. At this point in my career as a single man, I was already pretty over the apps and was being extremely picky. I came across this stunning woman and, for once, I immediately swiped right. It was a match. I took this opportunity to look over her profile a little more and realized that she looked really familiar-though I couldn’t conjure an idea of why this was the case. I decide to just be direct and say something to the effect of “hey, I know you from somewhere don’t I?”. She unmatched me immediately which, to be honest, stung a little bit because I didn’t find myself being as instantly interested in someone on Tinder as I was with her.

Fast forward a week. For context, I’m managing a restaurant in Austin, TX at this point. This is post-quarantine and the peak of the staffing shortages so it’s been a rough several months since I got transferred to this location in the company I was employed with. On this day in particular, I had to fire one of my full-time servers because he has been getting creepy with some of the women we worked with which put the schedule in dire straits. I got desperate and called my friend (let’s call her Mandy) to ask her to pick up some shifts even though I had previously denied her ability to do this because of a difficult availability. She answers the phone and says “hey you, I was literally just talking about you” which confused me a little but I was too much in work mode to really process it. She agrees to come back to work and then not five minutes later, my host approaches me and says there’s a call on the line from a former employee that wants to pick up some shifts. So naturally I’m like “miracle from the fucking sky, this is exactly what I need right now”. I pick up the phone and chat with the woman for a few minutes and she agrees to come in and talk with me about everything the next day. We exchange names at the end and I realize that *this* is the woman who unmatched me on Tinder. When I say my name, she lets out a bit of a surprised giggle as well so I knew she realized who I was at that point as well. 

She shows up the next day with Mandy in tow to talk to me then have dinner at the restaurant after. She is somehow even more stunning that she looked online and I’m sweating because I have a very strict “no fraternizing with staff” rule for myself but we have immediate chemistry as soon as we start talking and there’s absolutely an unspoken mutual attraction so I know that this is going to be weird, but i’m so short-staffed that I can’t even really argue with it. Her (let’s call her Macy) and Mandy end up sitting at the bar of the restaurant for the next two hours or so and we keep on meeting eyes. At one point, Macy goes to the bathroom and I walk up to Mandy (who I’ve known for years) and ask her if I was delusional or if Macy and I had matched on tinder to which she responds “oh yeah and she’s totally into you”. The attraction has now been confirmed which makes working together that much harder.

Her first day, there’s definitely some flirting happening, but I’m trying to keep things professional and at the end of the night, I’m talking to her about scheduling and I just say “by the way, let’s not talk about it please” to which she responds sarcastically “talk about what? i have no idea what you’re talking about.” so it’s been acknowledged, but buried as far as I’m concerned. Turns out, I was wrong because this “flirtationship” heats up incessantly for the next month and a half with moments like her messaging me for drinks at 1 AM, us following each other on instagram (which I know I shouldn’t have done, but did anyways), us having text exchanges that happened organically and ended up being meaningful conversation, etc.

One day, we’re both closing and end up talking at the end of the night for like an hour and, at this point, I know that I’m fucked. The next day at work, I’m about to leave and I see her polishing silverware by herself looking stunning as ever and I just snap and ask her to come have a drink with me to which she obliges. We agree to go to our mutual favorite bar and she asks me to pick her up. Turns out her place is a two minute walk from said bar so I’m a touch confused at the time and at this point, I’m determined not to sleep with her and to instead just blow off some steam by having a drink with her. We get there and immediately dive into having the best first date of my life. Sparks are flying all over the place and suddenly, the conversation stops and we’re just looking into each other’s eyes. We immediately start making out. It’s the best kiss that’s ever been documented in recorded history. I’ve completely relinquished control over the situation by now. Fuck it, what happens happens. She and I walk back to my car and and I drive her the thirty seconds it takes to get back to her place. She wants me to come upstairs with her, but I’m concerned because we’ve been drinking and I don’t want to take advantage in any way, shape, or form. She proceeds to tell me that she had me pick her up so that I would have to take her home and that this was already in the books for her as far as she had been concerned. So we go upstairs and fool around until like 4 AM and it’s incredible. We end up both passing out in her bed and wake up the next morning, do it again, then part ways.

I’m freaking out at this point because I just broke my number one rule by sleeping with a server. Not to mention that I really liked her so I didn’t know how to keep this under wraps, but I knew this had to be a one night thing. I have the day off on this particular day, but we have a prescheduled meeting with the managers so I go in anyways. Out of nowhere, my director of operations calls me and says that one of the managers at another store had been injured and they needed my help over there. *My last day at the current location just happened to be the previous day*. Now, everything was legal by some miracle. I text Macy to inform her about this and we proceeded to spend every single night together going forward. That was a year ago. We’ve had a whirlwind romance and the healthiest relationship I’ve experienced in my life. We now live together and share a beautiful life together. She’s my best friend and I just know I’m going to marry her. Best one night stand ever.

TLDR: matched on tinder, got unmatched but somehow met in real life, flirted for two months, hooked up, now in love.",1647958948.0,22

Long: A few years ago I was at this fundraiser gala for a bunch of local nonprofits of which one I was a donor for. After the event there was a cocktail hour where we stood around having drinks. Two women were there volunteering for this other nonprofit. I ended up inviting a bunch of people over for a pool party that evening including the two women. 

Later that night I came inside to refill my drink. They were sitting at the bar chatting over some wine. Both in bikinis etc. I found them both attractive but I had no intention of bedding either or them at this point. I poured us all some wine and got to know them: where they go to college, what neighborhood they're from, oh did you graduate from so and so district etc. When they told me which school they graduated from I asked them if they knew Ms. So and So. Their eyes both went wide. They told me they hated her; I told them I dated her briefly.  

Got some more wine. Convo switched to my volcano vaporizer I had and the strains I smoke. After a little while I let skip that their teacher and I recorded us having sex. One of them got excited and asked me to send it to her. I said absolutely not. Back to the volcano/cannabis and they asked to use it, which I said ok to. Then one of them brought up the sex tape again and I asked them if they really wanted to watch me banging their old teacher and she shrugged and said yeah. 

So we were heading upstairs and it suddenly dawned on me that we were going to get stoned and watch me fuck someone else and thought ""what if....nah?"" We got upstairs and I brought out my tablet and we sat on my loveseat with one of them on either side. She and I made the tape over a couple nights and I (poorly) edited it to look like your typical porno: started out with us giving each other oral, then we had sex in a few positions, ended with a money shot, etc. I saw one of the girls shoot a glance over to the other and grin a couple times. 

They must have liked what they saw because before it was even over one of them slipped her hand down my pants and started playing with my dick and then the other one joined in.

1536,AskReddit,What is your craziest one-night stand story?,,1647919683.0,2050,7216,0.91,Vanille_Croissant,"TL:DR Unexpected, spontaneous threesome in my birthday with a hot friend and her lesbian friend, filmed on video.

My (30ish M) birthday 2 years ago in my flat: huge party and this super hot friend (22F) I’d always had a flirt going on with (we’ve slept in the same bed several times, had crazy parties, seen each other naked, but never sex) had brought some girlfriends of hers. 

One of her friends (23F), who happened to be lesbian, but super hot and edgy, lived far away (I live in a big city in western europe) and asked me if she could stay over, and I agreed bc there was enough space and I live in the center, with lots of transport connections.

When everybody left at like 6am she asked me if she could use my shower and I obviously had no problem. 

Until this point I had had no flirting with the lesbian girl, first because she was really homosexual (quite a masculine vibe) and clearly at least 80% into girls (not like the girls that make out drunk with her girlfriends and then say “I’m bisexual”), but secondly because I found her a bit intense and at times a bit annoying…not my type of girl at all personality-wise

In any case, whilst she’s showering my other friend (the hot one I have had flirting going on, which, by the way, is also super sexually open with friends, but doesn‘t really sleep around) tells me “Let’s go shower with her, we are all stinky and dirty” and I said “Sure”. We got naked and jumped in the shower with her. She was a bit surprised but was fine with it. I have a big standing shower with clear glass where we all fit. At this point we’re all making jokes (nothing sexual), we were all quite drunk, washing each others hair and laughing etc. At some point my hot friend says “This is fun and I want to film it…” so she went to get her cellphone leaned it standing next to the sink and recorded for 8 minutes the interaction.

After not very long things started to get sexual when the girls started to make out (not their first time) and at the same time the lesbian started to grab my dick. Then my hot friend told her “blow him” so she did.

I’m very tall (6’6) so it is normally impossible to have sex in the shower for me, so we left all wet and ended up having a threesome in my bed. 

The lesbian girl was WILD, like she would give me blowjobs asking “have you ever been penetrated by a girl?” and stuck 2 fingers in my ass, etc. In the end I couldn’t come bc I was super tired and drunk so we stopped, laughed about it and collapsed in bed until like 2-3 pm.

It was extremely fun, especially because it was so spontaneous. What made it so special was that I truly never expected a threesome out of it (even when we were in the shower naked) since one was lesbian, and with the other we never had sex but had this super chill sorta open-minded friendship where we never forced sex although we had been naked and alone with eachother (long stories).

And for all wondering: YES I got the shower video (8min) from my friend the next day, and still have it. Have watched it many times.

So I bumped into a woman at the shop and I helped her pick up some heavy items. I didnt really look to see what they were, then I helped her get them into the car. We suddenly realised we hadn't paid for them so we drove off very quickly. 

We then got to hers and I realised these were those boxes stores put their money in when they get picked up by security companies. So realising I was in a lot more trouble than I thought, we lay low for a few hours. One thing led to another and we slept together. 

After this I thought it would be safe, So I snuck out and went home. I got home and was nackered and passed out.

The next morning I woke up horribly guilty. 1) for the crime I'd helped commit and 2) for cheating on my partner. So I went to the kitchen to confess to my partner and tell her I'd be going to the police station and I may not be back for a while. 

So I sat her down and told her, it was tough and she was quite, but had a vacant look on her face. Once I was done she said ""are you finished"" I sadly admitted I was. She then said ""You've had the flue and the medicines been giving you weird dreams, this is the first time you've left the bed in 3 days. Now go back to bed and I'll bring you some soup.""

I'm currently separated from my wife, but we had specifically spoken about the fact that we could and may date other people. Just for the record.

Anyway. I was living on friend's couches and hopping between hotels, kind of a dark time. So, as the newly single sad soon to be divorced guy, I fired up the dating sites. Everyone knows Tinder; every heard of Feeld? Oh, Feeld. Oh my.

Anyway, I generally was just chatting with attractive women on the site, if we talked for more than like a half an hour I'd come clean about my situation because otherwise I felt like I was being dishonest. Generally people were pretty understanding.

Anyway, one day out of the blue I get a message from somebody saying basically immediately ""Hey, do you want to come over some night to have a threesome with me and my super hot red head friend? Her birthday is coming up."" I basically said, well, I mean, let's chat for a little bit, buy me a drink first I guess? Eventually I decide that I'm not getting murdered to on the night in question I headed out their way.

So. They instruct me to park at the end of a road in a rural town; I park and somebody emerges from the woods. This is NOT one of the two women in question initially. Ok, now I'm getting a little bit weirded out but I can hang, whatever. She leads me into the woods down to the riverbank where they're having a fire. Kind of a cool setting.

Anyway, there's another dude there. Who just happens to be a stripper. Ok, now I'm not like, SUPER up on threesome etiquette, but I think general politeness would generally dictate that you warn the guys they're not the only other guys there? Or really, that there is going to be ANYBODY else there that you weren't expecting? Call me old fashioned. \[EDIT: when I first got there the dude and I looked at each other and if I read his face correctly, he's about as pumped by the situation as I am. There was a strange camaraderie there, I think.\]

Well, we stand around the fire and have some drinks, I'm still wondering if I'm going to be murdered. Eventually the heat gloves come out and they bring the rocks in the fire into the sweat lodge that they had constructed on the beach.

Oh, did I not mention the SWEAT LODGE?!

Yeah. So everybody just unceremoniously disrobes and we sit in the sweat lodge and talk about feelings for a while. Which was less crazy feeling at this point for me than you would expect, by this time I'm essentially treating this night as an anthropological study so I don't know what else to expect.

Well, after a while it's time to go hit the bedroom apparently, we re-robe and walk over to her house. Well one thing leads to another, the mystery woman just kind of orbits while the impromptu four-some goes down. Which again, was just kind of a bizarre experience.

Oh and then after we're all kind of just hanging out some meth pipes get busted out. So that's also a thing that happened. No, before you ask I did not partake, thank you very much.

Yes, I got tested, I'm in the clear nobody panic.

My second year of university, I was on a night out with some friends from my esports/gaming society. We end up in our on-campus nightclub and as the night progresses, we end up on the dancefloor, all smashed out of our minds on vodka and Jager bombs. 

Out of nowhere, this cute black girl comes up behind me and we talk for what felt like a few minutes (although my friend later said was about 10 seconds) before we start making out. I offer to buy some shots and she agrees and we end up in the outdoor smoking area, just so we can actually talk and hear each other. Now, I don't exactly remember what we were talking about, but I ended up making a joke about trading pancakes for virginity. At this point she asks if I'm a virgin and I tell the truth and say yes, it turns out she **HAS A KINK FOR TAKING GUY'S VIRGINITIES!** At this point, I'm pretty excited but I surprisingly remain cool enough about it that I don't weird her out and an hour or so later, we leave the club to go back to her place.

The walk to hers was actually less walking, more taking 3 steps and stopping to make out again but eventually we get to her's. There's just one issue, she only has a single bed, not a double and also her housemates are playing annoying music through the thin walls. I ask if she wants to go back to my place and she agrees but asks if it's ok if she brings her vibrator (I guess she did have experience with virgins lol) I say sure, since who am I to say no to that, and am also kind of into the idea of just watching her use it.

So we do the same walk in reverse, back to the nightclub so we can catch a taxi to my place. The taxi ride is incredibly awkward since I didn't want to do anything to make the driver uncomfortable so we kind of just sat in silence. We get to mine, go to my room and she pushes me onto the bed and starts giving me a bj before I can even take my shoes off. She also does something **AMAZING** with my balls that I have never felt again to this day. After that, clothes come off and we engage in some awkward, mediocre sex - I had no experience and we were both too drunk to do anything for any extended length of time. We eventually both just finish ourselves off, clean up and fall asleep...

I wake up around 8am and she's still there (hey, that's got to be a win right, she didn't leave!) We talk for a bit and I continue the joke about trading pancakes for virginity and actually offer to go and make them. She seems down for a free breakfast but something in the back of my mind tells me to not leave my wallet in the room with her so I sneak it into my pocket and go to the kitchen. 

When I return with fresh pancakes, I notice she has made-up my bed (better than I could!) and is playing some chill music over my bluetooth speaker. I instantly feel guilty about my decision with my wallet, until I notice something weird... My PC is turned on and she's **TRIED TO GUESS MY PASSWORD!** I ask her about it and she kind of shrugs it off and we make small talk while eating pancakes and order shakes from a local place on Uber Eats. We end up laying together tired and hungover which escalates into me fingering her (and hey, I actually got her to orgasm from, another win for first timer me lol).

She says she has to meet a friend, so I walk with her to her friend's place which was close by, where we awkwardly hug and then never see each other again.

Woke up to the smell of bacon as I look at the door she comes in a dressing gown with her son, like 3 or 4? And says ""say hello to daddy""...
Inside I'm freaking out. Outside I just said hello little man, I'm racking my brains and think to myself SHIT!!! DID I USE A CONDOM???, casually look about ""for my socks"" I'm about to explain that introducing me as daddy to her son was not appropriate and I'm certain she can sense where this is going so slices my bacon sandwich puts it on a plate and hands it to me in one hand with the biggest carving knife you can imagine....she looks really pretty, but has this innocent yet somehow emotionless terrifying look...so I spend an hour there and make my excuses and leave with a kiss goodbye and a ""see you later"" now I'm stuck in the arse end of nowhere had to get a taxi to my hotel. 
I left and called her to explain im not looking for a relationship and she hits the roof accuses me of duping her (i didnt think i did) numerous texts and calls later I thought at least she doesn't know where I live (London) 
One day at work reception call and transfer her to me... fuck. She wants to see me and she's outside, she found me on linked in and had driven from swansea to london... I agree to meet in a coffee shop and I'm dreading the ""I'm pregnant"" basically long story short she's not pregnant but she needs a man her son needs a father and that is going to be me. 
I figured the best policy is to be honest with her which goes down badly and she insists she will be back every day. 
So... I have a think about this and at the time as a single man, I did nothing wrong, yes it's embarrassing as a senior figure in the company but I've not done anything wrong. So I explain it to my bosses and he and she define this as stalking so they decide to screen my calls and prevent her entering the building. I was grateful they were on my side, I notify the police as she acts on her promise and tries daily to come into the building with her son. Eventually she gives in, I had one other run in from her trying to follow me home. Quite difficult to do when I get the tube across London and a train home, it's easy to loose someone when you know London well and they don't.

So...several months later I get a letter at work demanding I pay her credit card bill of 6k that was run up because I made her depressed and I caused that to be run up. it never went anywhere and other than some abusive messages sent to a girl I started seeing, the thing I don't get is how she knew? I have social media but is private and my profile picture is a silhouette with friends not shared.

Lessons learnt
Be private.

Back in the day I used to be a lad but always be careful driving a car - wear a seatbelt... no matter how cute, sexy, handsome etc. You never know people until you know them.... wear a seat belt (condom) 

Don't jump into bed unless everyone knows what their getting, a new boyfriend, husband, father figure or just 30 minutes of cardio followed by some endorphins release.... make people aware.

Be honest... even if they have a knife in their hand!!! Maybe distance yourself a bit and make yourself safe and then tell them the truth.

Welsh women are very passionate and usually thats great but this one misplaced that passion a lot.

Check a house when you go into it.... we weren't quiet, she was a proper grunter... and the thought of that little boy sat there whilst his mum in the next room made warthog impressions will sit with me for the rest of my life... also I have no idea if that child was left alone all night or if he was dropped off whilst I was asleep in the morning, I hope the latter....

Don't get sucked in by looks, there was something off about this girl but she was hot so I followed my dick... go with your gut.

If your being pressured to do something you dont want to tell people. Don't sit on it, I was so worried that she was pressurising me and thought I was going to loose my job or she was going to claim rape (that was aired at one point but I quickly dismissed - I think she realised her claim would contradict her history of text messages)

This was a terrifying 18 months before she disappeared and even now 16 years on... I still get a funny feeling that i think I'm being watched. I can't prove it and as a result of her I begun working from home to prevent her cleverly following home in secret, and even now out of habit I drive to a different train station in another town if I go to the office just incase she follows me despite there being a train station down the road from my house.

She was a clear nut case.

Part of me wants to see this so she can realise she didn't win.

We were at work and during a little downtime us 3 guys started to share our one night stand stories. My friend went first, We’ll call my friend “Dave”- he starts his story as being in a bar somewhere in Michigan with a couple of friends. Said he was having fun when he noticed a cute girl across the bar. As the night went by, he noticed that the cute girl had noticed his group of friends and after building a bit of courage, he said fuck it and walked over to introduce himself. He mentioned that besides being cute, she was very attractive. They hit it off and they left the bar and headed to the girls place. There, they had some wine and one thing led to another on the couch and they were making out. A couple of seconds into making out, the girl stopped and pulled away. Dave said he thought that that’s as far she was going to go that night but was instantly surprised when she said “before we continue, I gotta let you know that I’m a freak, we can do whatever you want first, then it’s my turn “ Dave told us that he didn’t think about it and immediately agreed. So the action went from the couch in the living room to her room and he said they went at it for a good while and they did everything- bj, 69, anal, etc. Once he finished, they laid in bed for a minute when she said “ok, my turn “ and got out of bed and walked out of the room. Dave said he got excited for round 2 and wanted to see what was in store. The girl came back moments later with large empty dinner plate.

Confused, he asked what it was for. The girl repeats again that she was a freak and hope she wouldn’t scare him and asked Dave to go to the bathroom and poop on it. To lay a log down. As long as possible.

Dave said he repeated what she had asked back to her make sure he understood. The girl confirmed and said “yes please, after you do it, I’m going to put it in the freezer and use it as a dildo later”

Dave said he had to keep his word and agreed to the deed. However he couldn’t just poop on command and told her he would do it as soon as he needed to go #2.

Dave said the girl got back into bed and round number 2 got underway and they ended up passing out on the bed. Dave woke up sometime in the middle of the night and headed to the bathroom not before grabbing the shiny white ceramic plate from the night stand and laid a log down on it. He said that seeing a crap log on a kitchen plate started to make him wonder how much of a freak this girl really was and I guess it scared him a little bc he said he went back to the room, got dressed and peaced out of the girls place. 

What did he do with the plate? He said he took it to the kitchen and left it on the counter for her to find when she woke up.",1647948204.0,8

I thought sure why not, Josh turns up, we all get in the backseat of his car and she and i take turns blowing him, it didnt go any further which was fine it was a bit awkward with our friends right outside the car basically.

So they came to get us and we went to Paul's house and paired up, Paul and i had sex on the bed while Adam and my friend went at it on the floor. Then afterwards we talked, smoked, drank and all hung out together. We slept the night at Pauls house and then in the morning the boys got up and casually mentioned they had to get ready because Josh was on his way over to pick them up. I looked at my friend and she said ""ohh i forgot to tell you these two are Josh's best mates.""

I was so wrong.  

She didn’t believe in MATH!  Yes, she had this fucking idiotic conspiracy theory that all mathematics beyond like elementary school arithmetic was fake and “made up.”  Algebra, geometry, trig, calculus, etc - fake fake fake. 

When I asked how in the world she explained all of the real world applications of advanced math she denied that there were such applications. 

For example, let’s take building a bridge.  For her, there’s no math behind it, there’s just hundreds of years of trial and error and people wrote down what worked and what didn’t.  Then engineers came along and “made up” a bunch of fake numbers to justify getting a fat paycheck.  In her mind, everything was like that - just a series of trial and error with people going back later to “explain with fake numbers” why that final step worked and earn a bunch of money for bullshit.

Well Friday night of the con I had gone out drinking with friends (this entire night is a story in and of itself) but after several bars, doing comedy, and several hotel room parties. I had met a lotnof people and had a blast. At the last party there was someone there that now that I looked back definitely wanted to get down. Well he kept stealing my hat, getting close to me, and even flirting. I never picked up on any of those things. After the party we walked to a McDonald's about 1km away (or .6 miles) and got some food. Afterwards we all went back to the hotel. Well at this point everyone was parting ways and going to their rooms and going to bed. So me and this guy were waking toward my room. I didn't think anything of it. We had been talking all night. We went into my room and I laid in bed and talked for a bit. We were laying in bed together. I NEVER suspected anything. Even when he put his arm around me. While we were laying there he started to rub his ass on my dick (plot twist. I'm a bisexual male) and I still didn't think anything of it. Until he grabbed my dick and took off his pants. In that moment It clicked. It took me all night to figure this out. Well my friend was in the other bed passed out. And I couldn't bring myself to have sex in the room incase he woke up. So. While both of us were naked. I said ""how about we do it on the balcony instead"" and we did. While having sex on the balcony  someone a few rooms down were doing the same. All 4 of us acknowledged eachother. It was quite funny. Well as I was doing it it dawned on me I was not wearing a condom. And as I was about to finish I pulled out and finished over the side of the balcony. We were in the 18th floor of this hotel and the hotel restaurant with no roof is right below us. Where my seed landed is beyond me to this day. My favorite part tho. I found out my roommate had sex with the same guy as me the next night. So now me and my good friend are now tunnel buddies. I thought it was funny. He didn't.

TL;DR: I had sex on a balcony while others watched, nutted off the edge, and found out my good friend had sex with the same person the next day.

One day I told a mutual friend, let's call him H, that I thought she was attractive (this is important for later). He agreed that she was pretty and gave me her number. 

So a few months ago by, and nothing really comes of it. We texted a little but only in a very platonic capacity. Then one day, as I'm stumbling home drunk after a party, the girl approaches me while I'm getting mozzarella sticks in the student union building and invites me back to her place. I was pretty shocked, considering I had texted her like once or twice and maybe spoken to her once for three seconds, but obviously my surprise was overshadowed by drunken glee. Of course, I immediately assumed that H had told her I was into her. Why else would she randomly proposition me for sex? 

So we go back to her place, the sex is ok, whatever, not the point of the story. After we finish, she casually drops a bomb shell on me: She just got out of a relationship with H. Like, few days ago. 

I literally had no idea. When H gave me her number, ya know, after I said I thought she was hot, he had been dating her for months. And he just decided not to tell me. He had kept it a secret from almost all of his close friends. So this is a mini TIFU post I guess, since I fucked my close friends ex a few days after they broke up. 

I had also just gotten out of (the worst) relationship, so my crush asking me for sex was actually a much needed confidence boost. Still a really bizarre situation though.

Picture it.. it’s 2007, we have on our sparkly tops and bump it’s… we are hot shit, heading out with our flip phones for a night on the town. 

We are at the club dancing, having fun… and we meet these two super hot Australian guys that are in town for a soccer tournament. We hang out with them all night, sneaking shots because we are underage. Come closing time, there were two of them left and all three of us. We get invited down the block to keep partying at their hotel. (Please keep in mind that we are Americans… and these guys were from Australia. Which means they had *accents*… which… well, to a young American girl.. it’s simply HOT ASF. We are THIRSTING hard for these foreign futbol guys) so we decide to YOLO before it was cool and go with them. L and I have claimed one hot guy each and C is a bit salty at this point and said she doesn’t want to go. We are arguing with her… like hey the whole ass team is there so we will probably meet more than these two. She is having none of it so she gets upset and leaves us there in the parking lot. Now we kind of have no choice but to go with these guys (these were the days before UBER) so we do. We head to the hotel and have a few more drinks and decide to go explore. We are sneaking around the hotel and we head up to the very top floor of the hotel where all the executive areas area and we see these floor to ceiling window and huge 5 star restaurant. It’s open but completely dark and empty. All the tables are set to the nines, all the windows are clean and sparkling, and the only people in sight are us four. We are all four walking around and get to the edge table where the windows were and L starts kissing her guy and I start kissing mine. We are all kind of laughing and giggling and excited because we are all doing something we shouldn’t be in a place that is off limits to us! So the fun begins, one couple on one table, and the other couple on another table… one thing leads to another.

One of them dresses me up for the occasion, get super drunk, meet some punk chick who seemed to think I was hot shit. Mate who invited me kept trying to put the moves on her, but she kept blow him off for me. I wasn't trying to hit on her, I was *super* awkward and just kind of let it happen. She invites me back to her place which was at the top of a really big hill, but we did the drunken stumble all the way up. Turns out her housemates are home and she doesn't get along with them. Asks me where I live, it's 2 suburbs away. She has the brilliant idea to take her BMX to my place. It's really small, I'm super lanky, so I wouldn't be able to ride it properly with her on the back, so instead this \~5'2 punk chick is giving me, \~6'4 a lift down a really long, steep hill, shitfaced on a tiny bike. We get back to my place, smoke a lot of weed, have really shitty sloppy drunk sex. When we wake up the next morning we realise we'd not even exchanged names. My housemates, who were awkward nerds like me, think I'm a legend. My punk friend is mad at me for months for ""stealing that hot chick off him""

The epilogue? About 8 years later I'm trying to find a new place to live, so I respond to an ad online for a room at a sharehouse. Have deja vu when I'm at the front door and you guessed it, punk girl answers the door. Turns out she was the one moving out, so I would have gotten her room if they'd accepted me.",1647956356.0,3

I had an extremely similar scenario happen to me. The only differences between my story and yours is that I didn't hire a lawyer. The paternity test happened because the state forces a woman to find out who the father is in order to recieve welfare (the state forces the father to pay their share).

During my walkabout days I ran into an old acquaintance IRL, I didn't recognize her but I could tell she was kind of vibing me in a strange way so I said hello. 

It turns out that years and years ago her then boyfriend accosted me at a coffee shop she worked across the hall from in a small local mall type building. He thought I went there so often because I was staking her but no, I was just a bartender who drank medically significant amounts of espresso. Sue me. 

Anyway, we chat, we know a lot of the same people, numbers are exchanged yadda yadda yadda. The next night or to she invites me over, we go to a Halloween thing and back to her place and, well, you know. 

Ok. We did get together another time for a drink, and while we're chatting just out of goddamn cinnamon toast-fucking nowhere she looks me dead in the eyes and just announces, ""hey, just so you know, I don't mix my race.""

Well then.

I ask basically, uhm, can you repeat that? And oh my she did. And my first thought was just like, well fuck, this sucks. Because in every other way it was a very pleasant bit of time we had spent together, but I'm not like, SUPER down for white supremacy? 

So yeah, I accidentally slept with a white supremacist. I made the snap decision that I'm not going to change her mind, it's just not something I can really deal with at the moment. So I gracefully cut the hang short and we parted ways.

(I don't know what to call it. I used to call it Goat Ropin Disco. He was really good at it though. All the country ladies were all over him all night every time I went with him. As a plus he was always so busy dancing he was the designated driver because he was too busy sliding around to drink). Anyway

One night he's doing his thing and keeps dancing with this woman that has a very obvious ring on her finger. Eventually she says, ""You can buy a widow a drink"". So they ended up back at her place making the beast with two backs. He said in between breaks she cooked him a steak. Anyway, they eventually passed out only to be woke up early in the morning by her very much alive husband coming home. Dude didn't care that she had brought home a guy 20+ years younger than his wife. He was very pissed that he'd have to wait for his wife to change the sheets so he could go to sleep.

Anyways, he said he was hanging out a friends house and his friend casually asked him if he wanted to fuck his wife so, he did.

The guy was sitting in a chair in the corner while Rick pounded his wife missionary. 

The wife was screaming bloody murder and he was really getting into it. All of the sudden he felt something on his balls.

We were both at the local watering hole. The only bar in my town. We were not there together, but we did speak that night and he bought me a beer.

He was sitting at the bar, just drinking. A rather large woman came over and sat next to him. They were just making chit chat. No flirting or anything other than jibber jabber.

Well, there was this lesbian that hung out at this bar. She was mayyyybe 5'1. If I had to guess she was 150 lbs? Huge boobs. Not an ugly girl. Her nickname was ""wahoo"". She wore a black leather jacket all year long and a blue bandana on her head. She was always the loudest one in the bar. She also drank beer out of a pitcher. I wish I made this up, but I didnt. I think she was of a Hispanic decent and I had known her for 15 or 20 years. She lived in a trailer park near town.


Anyways, Rick was sitting at the bar, talking to this lady, and wahoo comes out of the bathroom, sees Rick talking to her. She walks up to Rick and pulls out a knife and says ""what are you doing talking to my woman?"" 

Rick never even looks at her and says ""bitch, you're gonna wish that fuckin knife is a candy bar when I make you eat it."" 

She looked stunned, told ""her woman"" to get in the truck and they left. 

Wahoo didnt want no Ricky that night😂😂😂",1647960797.0,32

During the first part of the experiment, rats were put in a bucket of water. After about 15 minutes the rat would begin to drown. The scientist plucked the rat out of the bucket of water merely seconds before death.

After a couple of days the scientist repeated this process. However, instead of drowning after 15 minutes of treading water, some of the rats survived for up to 2 and half days.

The scientist concluded that the rats were able to continue swimming because they retained the HOPE of being rescued, as this is what they experienced during the first trial.

It raises **SO** many questions, and would honestly create more questions than provide answers. 

Let me explain. 

Subject A has suffered a fatal cranial trauma. They have a cerebral edema that due to its severity and location, cannot be operated on, and in a matter of moments, Subject A will expire due to their injuries.

Subject B is an unfortunate patient, their body is crippled and dying due to a congenital disease. Their mind, however, is exceptionally functional, in fact, beyond so for what one would expect of a normal, functional individual of their age. Subject B has expressed an unwavering desire to finally die. They have little time left, and what time there is will be spent in unparalleled agony and misery. 

With the logistics and families sorted out, a brain transplant is set up.

Subject A, their body kept in a state of cryogenic stasis, receives the brain of Subject B the brain stem is successfully spliced and the surgery is considered a textbook success in every aspect. 

As Subject A begins to recover, we are faced with several questions. The biggest of them being: 

**WHO IS SUBJECT A?**

We know that our thoughts and memories, the things that make us who we are, are in fact created by a string of rapid firing neurons, each connected in such a way as to recreate experiences every time they are activated. Subject A, now in possession of an entirely different brain, no longer has those pathways. They have lost absolutely everything that made them who they are. 

Or

Has Subject A in fact become Subject B?

Has Subject B, their body now ready to be cremated, been given a new chance at life? Is Subject B now in control of a new body and Subject A is now dead? 

*More controversial still*:

With the destruction of Subject B's corpse, and seeing that Subject A has inadvertently become Subject B, can we assume that if there is a soul, it is kept within the brain? If Subject A resembles neither themselves nor Subject B in thoughts and habits, is this because if there is a soul, both souls have passed on and now this individual is something different from humanity, akin to a machine with free will? 

What if Subject A somehow expresses thoughts and habits expressed by both subjects, such as seen in rare cases of heart transplants?


I don't know, it's just been something that's been on my mind for a while.

I am glad that my thoughts could get so many others to question things and really take a look at what we consider physical vs consciousness. Thank you for the awards as well, they weren't exactly needed lol; but I certainly appreciate them nonetheless.

> Genie (born 1957) is the pseudonym of an American feral child who was a victim of severe abuse, neglect, and social isolation. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal child psychology.When she was approximately 20 months old, her father began keeping her in a locked room. During this period, he almost always strapped her into a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with her arms and legs immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished.The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles County child welfare authorities in November 1970, when she was 13 years and 7 months old, after which she became a ward of the state of California.

Does spanking 6 year olds work? How about 12 year olds? Would a punch to the gut work better? Does time out truly teach kids how to behave? Are strong words more important than actions?

How about the legal and penal system? If empirical data could show that shock therapy reduced repeat offenders crime rates by over 95%, is that worth it? If we knew waterboarding pedophiles would stop them from targeting kids, should we do it?

This would not only focus on punishment though, it's also a study on when to punish vs when to rehabilitate.

>When chemical enhancements had gone as far as they could go, the scientists turned to genetic engineering.

>Super sportsmen and women were grown, literally grown, in laboratory test-tubes around the planet.

>The world's official sports bodies banned the new mutants from competing in events against normal athletes, and so a new, alternative sports body was formed, and set up in competition.

>The GAS (Genetic Alternative Sports) finished 'normal' sport within two years. Sports fans were no longer interested in seeing a conventional boxing match, when they could witness two genetically engineered pugilists -who were created with their brains in their shorts, and all their other major organs crammed into their legs and feet, leaving their heads solid blocks of unthinking muscle -knock hell out of one another for hours on end in a way that normal boxers could only manage for minutes.

>Basketball players were grown twenty feet tall.

>Swimmers were equipped with gills and fins.

>Soccer players were bred with five legs and no mouths, making after-match interviews infinitely more interesting. However, not all breeds of genetic athletes were accepted by the GAS and new rules had to be created after the 2224 World Cup, when Scotland fielded a goalkeeper who was a human oblong of flesh, measuring eight feet high by sixteen across, thereby filling the entire goal. Somehow they still failed to qualify for the second round.

>American football provided the greatest variety of mutant athletes, each one specifically designed for its position. The Nose Tackle, for instance, was an enormous nose -a huge wedge of boneless flesh that was hammered into the scrimmage line at every play. Wide receivers were huge Xs -four long arms that tapered to the tiny waist perched on top of legs capable of ten-yard strides.

If not her, than their ape siblings might off them whilst playing. Assuming this is a newborn.

A toddler might be a bit different, but for best results I'd say a 4-5 year old would be a better starting point... however once it comes to territory, rivalries, predators, hell - even mating - the human would be past tense fairly quick. 

Actually to go off on a slight tangent here, the part of me that believes in bigfoot drew this conclusion up. Ive been thinking about all the kids who go missing in the woods, only to turn up deceased a couple of years later in places where SaR workers had already checked, with seemingly no explanation on how they get to those areas in the first place. Othertimes when they are thankfully found alive, some mention cowmen, bearmen, monkeys, dogmen, etc... watching over them, or playing with them, feeding them. Gets you thinking, could a sentient, instinctually maternal, and assumed grief stricken over the loss of their own offspring, ape-like homonid ""kidnap"" a child who is out in the woods, and attempt to raise them be plausible?
 If so I'd presume that their attempts would end in a similar fashion as the previous hypothetical Gorilla scenario. As odd as bigfoot existing might sound though, I'd say if they did end up being real that would probably be a pretty sound explanation for a LOT of those missing kids in the woods who just vanish in the blink of an eye.

A Gattaca-style future doesn't even need to use editing at all as that future could be achieved purely on parental selection of which of their unedited natural eggs and sperm to combine.

The obvious current insurmountable hurdle though is in knowing exactly which egg+sperm to combine to closely match the parents' desired optimal genetic outcome from the set of possible natural offspring; but once we're able to cross that information threshold, then every child can be ""one in a billion"" (and editing would then presumably be unnecessary at that point, sidestepping most of the ethical concerns that come with editing).",1647940159.0,20

I just finished some anatomy courses in school so I’m going to weigh in on some body systems, no intent to put down your idea but as a logic experiment.
Lots of systems in the body function efficiently and effectively as a result of their correlation to other body systems. Also there are lots of physics principles involving fluids and gases that the body utilizes to function. 
For example, breathing air is not just us activating chest muscles to “suck in” air. Muscles on our rib cage as well as our diaphragm contract to create more space in our chest cavity, creating negative pressure, so that air wants to rush in to our lungs to fill the larger space. Then we tie in circulation, in which blood is circulated to the lungs to get oxygenated. From largest to smallest to largest again, we have veins to venules to capillaries to arterioles to arteries. While the heart does pump blood, at the smallest point of circulation (capillaries) where oxygen and wastes are exchanged, the capillaries are only a single blood cell in width and it is the change in pressure gradient that enables blood cells to go from a halt back into the larger vessels until it’s in circulation again, not just because the heart is “pumping”. So your concept of stretching things out farther is interesting because I feel like the pressure gradients wouldn’t work to move blood anymore.
Plus if you’re stretching things out and are able to keep the nervous system connected, that’s already a scientific win in my eyes as many people could benefit from having nerves repaired or replaced, whether after accidents, injuries, or organ transplants. 
Very thought provoking!

Edit: you’d probably have to swap research with the cybernetics guy, as the body functions because of the physics principles that can occur with tissues, organs, systems of the “plumbing, heating, and electrical” all being in close proximity to each other. Spreading out even one thing would mean other systems may be compromised and not able to function. So some aspects of certain systems would have to be replaced by mechanical things that are sustained by external forces/energy, not bio-produced",1647936482.0,124

After 100 years the people on your island probably wouldn't be that much different from anyone else. 100 years is only 3 to 5 generations.

Left for longer though, it's very likely that children born on the island would have a lot of health issues.

With such a small gene pool to work with, certain physical traits would be very common or become exaggerated. This would include problematic genes and susceptibility to illnesses caused by recessive genes.

For example, if one of the progenitors had a recessive gene which made them more likely to get a certain illness, their children would either have the same gene or might get half of it, becoming capable of passing it down.

In an ordinary society, genes are shuffled with a completely new set each generation, lowering the frequency of recessive problem genes. This, over time, leads to a more resilient population.

However, on incest island, the third generation would very likely inherit the problem gene. This then almost guarantees it being passed to any further descendants.

After a few centuries you get a whole population which all have a set of largely the same genes. As each person's genes get more similar, each new child ends up with more and more identical genes to each parent.

While I'm not sure if it'd ever get to a stage where the DNA is non-viable, children would likely be very sickly and prone to certain diseases. Many would probably die young. Perhaps, after a few centuries, it would be so bad that children would die before they are old enough to procreate, leading to the end of the experiment.

There are actually some examples of this happening in real life - see Charles II of Spain. He had an inbreeding coefficient of >0.25 - around what it would have been if his parents had been siblings. He had a lot of health issues.

Pedigree dogs are also a good case study for the effects of inbreeding. They notoriously have many health issues directly caused by inbreeding for certain physical features. Pugs are especially prone to issues, from crippling hip problems to eye infections and problems breathing. But people think their faces are cute, so they get bred anyway. Non-perfect pug puppies usually either die young or are culled.

If you go far back enough, everyone alive today can be traced to common ancestors. These are known as Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve. These two also make pretty fascinating reading.",1647939736.0,217

That is to say that, for example, if the only food source for those dogs were field rats then they would only get as big as their food source allowed and would evolve to hunt it most efficiently. A pomeranian might eventually become average Terrier sized, but there would be no pressure for it to become Great Dane sized - and at the size of a Dane it would also probably suck at catching rats compared to the more nimble Terrier breeds.  
  
It works in the other direction as well. Putting Rottweilers into your enclosed fence where their only source of food is hard to catch hummingbirds would -probably- eventually reduce the overall size, weight, height, torso thickness, etc etc. You have to be fast to catch hummingbirds and even when you do they're probably not calorically dense enough to support current Rottweiler builds.  
  
You've also got to keep in mind if other predators were introduced. If there is competition for the same food source then maybe that pomeranian stays the same size and becomes dependent on worms as its main food source instead of rats. This is basically what mammals did during the reptilian age. They didn't want none of that dinosaur smoke so they said fuck it and occupied a different niche.",1647927136.0,132

The researchers made some really careless mistakes, the first one being that they took the baby chimp, Gua, away from her chimp parents when she was 7 months old and already attached to them. Then when they cut the experiment short, they also just shipped her off from her human parents and made her live as a chimp being used in several other experiments. She died of pneumonia because she didn't have her chimp immune system or her human parents' protection. Her human brother, Donald, committed suicide in his 40s though there's no way to know if the experiment was behind that. The experiment did lead to his development being slightly stunted, as he learned some chimp behaviors like screeching when he should have learned to talk.

[Here's an Olympic gold medallist describing the process](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics-ohuruogu-banned-after-missing-three-drug-tests-5330058.html)

>One of these is to adhere to the regulations imposed on competing athletes, including rule number 32.2 (d), which is to make my whereabouts known for one hour every day, 365 days a year. 

Now that means for every day, there's 23 hours that an athlete knows they can't be tested. 

There are lots of short elimination half life drugs out there that you can combine together into a programme to beat these restrictions. For example GHRP-6 is a peptide that stimulates the body to release growth hormone. GHRP-6 has an elimination half life of 2.5 hours, that means 6-8 hours after using GHRP-6, it is no longer detectable. Another example is Testosterone propionate, it's a form of testosterone, and one of its notable characteristics is that it's a very short chain ester of Testosterone. This gives it an elimination half life of 4.5 hours. The study that I have read about Testosterone propionate used a 1000mg dose that was undetectable in blood plasma after three days. Now if you wanted to microdose this, you could cut that down to under 20 hours.

And that's not even mentioning designer PEDs, which are actively produced to have very short detection windows. There's not much info about these designer PEDs as their makers don't like to shout about them, for obvious reasons. It's hard for anti doping agencies to create tests for drugs they don't know exist. (It's also illegal to supply people unregulated drugs).

The facts that althetes can't be tested for 23 hours of the day and that there are PEDs out there with very short detection windows means creating a doping programme to get around these restrictions isn't too difficult for someone experienced in the field. 

Add in that athletes also can miss three tests in a 12 month window before getting sanctioned, which gives them a couple of mulligans if they mess up their timing and the testers show up. It's like the anti doping programme is designed to be beaten, or at least not try too hard to catch people, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The actual level of draconian restrictions you would need to imposed on athletes to actually run a half decent testing programme would be ridiculous, and the benefit is that we get worse sports with athletes have shorter, more injury plagued careers.",1647941883.0,79

It's a long story, but basicallly what happened, is I only have good eye and I tried to make the bad eye work together with my good eye again.


Longer story is that I have two different eye strenghts and this causes my brain to ignore the input of the 'bad' eye. Like, your brain gets two images from both your eyes and layers on top of each other, right? Well, my brain throws away one image and works with only the 'good' image. Now, the 'bad' eye does work. Physically there is nothing wrong with it. In fact, my brain does make use of the image of the 'bad' eye that the 'good' eye cannot see. So, basically, my peripheral eyesight is perfectly fine. 


Now, day to day it doesn't affect me too much, though growing up I did had (or still have maybe) a slight hand-eye coordination problem. Not sure if it is because of that, but would not be surprised either. Anyhow, this did lead to the ""funny"" side effect I always permanently see my nose on one side. Like, usually people's nose is in the middle(ish) of their face and they don't see it unless they focus on it, right? Well, on my case I just see my nose permanently on one side (like, as if you close one eye).


Anyhow, a few years ago the optometrist noticed that my 'bad' eye was perfectly fine (before this we thought I had a lazy eye, but that turned out to be incorrect). Only the strength was very much different from the 'good' one. For comparison, 'good' eye is 0, 'bad' one is like -3.25. Bit of a difference. I cannot see the Coca-Cola letters on the side of the truck, to give you an idea.


Obviously, it's better to use both eyes, so my optometrist use those eye glass measurement thingies to make the 'bad' eye perfect vision as well, and then removed the blockade in front of my 'good'. And, well, I lost vision.


So, now my brain finally got two perfect images to work with, and lets just say that did not go well lol. I still saw light, so it wasn't pure darkness or anything, but it was just nothing. Pure meaningless. It's hard to describe, but you know how a monitor has pixels? Imagine that your view has those pixels and somehow every individual pixel was placed at every possible pixel location simultanously for every pixel present.


Interestingly, there was also movement. You know those videos where people fall over and roll down a hill? Like, you get grass, sky, grass, different patch of grass etc. Like, the image is basically gibberish with a lot of recognisable movement in it. Well, that also happened, and then for good measure also add that tunnel vision blue light movement they show on TV and games whenever they go lightspeed (like in Star Wars. So, a lot was happening, and at the same time nothing at all.


The movement didn't stop just in the eyes. I was unable to balance myself and was swaying all over the place. I was sitting, so nothing happened, but I could imagine falling over if I was standing. I was swaying *hard*. I even felt it in my brain that something had happened. I didn't have a headache or other pain or anything, but it felt as someone slightly gripped the front of my brain and give it a slight twist. It was wild.


Well, eventually after a few seconds or so (maybe 10, 20?) my vision returned and slowly I got a single vision again. Unfortunately, every time I blinked the two images would spread out again at like max distance to slowly get back together. So, seeing double. Every time I blinked. And it taking a bit to get to normal again. Not great lol


So, yeah, I ""reactivated"" (maybe reallign?) my 'bad' eye, and now I see two seperate noses. Permanently. Joy lol


I can improve it by wearing contact lensen. I'm not sure, but I think the distance between the eye and the glass is blurry in such a way that my brain gets thrown off, whereas with the lenses it is directly on the eye and both images are perfect. I really should wear my contacts more (well, daily really), and if I do this long enough the noses do come together and disappear (I had this happen once. It was wild. I was wandering around a parking garage like a kid in a candy store lol) like regular people's vision, but it is extremely tiring and I just don't have the energy for it.


So, yeah, that is why I'm not entirely sure if cybernetic eyes beyond a regular vision as it is right now can exist. Because you can get used to the image, but I'm not sure your brain can handle constantly switching between different modes and zoom levels and such.",1647955950.0,32

1.The oldest humans aboard the Axiom are in their 40s (lifespans shortened by several decades due to unhealthy lifestyles)

2. Only a few dozen children aboard (most likely cloned as natural reproduction would be impossible, or fatal)
Edit: or at least sex would be physically impossible. IVF and artificial wombs are another possibility 

3. After 5 years, all their food supplies would have run out, so where are they getting food?! (some fan theories suggest cannibalism). Also, all the food came in cups. Even with all sufficient chemical nutrition (doubtful), the lack of sensory nutrition (color, flavor, texture, etc) would cause various health problems.

4. No human crew members except Captain 

5. The plant Wall E found was NOT the first or only plant growing on Earth. This is shown just after everyone disembarks the Axiom after arriving on Earth. Meaning other positive EVEs were found and culled under AUTO's orders, with previous captains being none the wiser.

6. The Axiom is the flagship of a fleet. Some ships were seen on Earth, having never taken off. There may be more that did take off, and are now ghost ships. The Axiom is the only ship visible on the monitors.",1647894064.0,7255

Her stories are often suggested between the lines rather than depicted directly. 

Her film You Were Never Really Here is also fantastic. It sounds like a sleazy thriller (a ruthless badass who hunts pedophiles with a hammer), but is in fact a complex and subtle character portrait about a man coping with PTSD and suicidal depression.

It's one of my favorite movies, no question, but I just can't get through it without my eyes turning into faucets.

In fact, there are scenes now that fuck me up that didn't affect me at all the first time I watched. For example: >!the part in the beginning where Clem is talking about Huckleberry Hound and Joel has no idea what she's talking about. But later in the movie we find that Huckleberry Hound was Joel's favorite cartoon, and because of that he thought her name was ""magical"". But then he gets her erased and he has to take Huckleberry Hound out as well because all of his memories of his favorite cartoon are now indelibly linked to the woman who erased him.!<

The first time I watched it was *right after a breakup* with a woman who's eyes were filled with stars every time I looked at them. Every memory I had at the time would somehow loop back to her. Watching Eternal Sunshine while I was going through that fucking *broke* me. >!When his memories are disappearing as he realizes how much he loves her and doesn't want to lose the memories but all he can do is watch as every last bit of his Tangerine is washed away!< I just completely broke down. Tears, loud bawling, snot pouring out of my nose… the ugliest of ugly cries. I've never seen another movie that comes close to showing what that kind of breakup does to a person. It also does an incredible job depicting the confusion and disorientation inside a dream.

Every rewatch you find something new. The world building is outrageously good and the metaphors are incredible. 

On my latest rewatch, I noticed a women holding her dead son in the siege of Bexhill in the same way the Mother and son are depicted in Pietà by Michelangelo, which is told by his friend who rescued another sculpture by Michelangelo, that they could not recover the sculpture [Pietà](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)?wprov=sfti1https://maps.apple.com/?ll=41.902222,12.453333&q=Piet%C3%A0%20(Michelangelo)&_ext=EiQpfPNtBHzzREAxIOiQTRvoKEA5fPNtBHzzREBBIOiQTRvoKEA%3D). 

Also one of the reasons Micheal Caine chose to do this film is that he was extremely against the 2006 Iraq war

The one shot scene combat scene where the fugitives are battling the British Army while Theo, Kee and the baby are running to the boat is described by experts as one of the most realistic combat engagement scenes in cinema history.

The commentator Matthew Henry wrote: 

“This text has been the occasion of great distress to some gracious souls; they have been ready to conclude that every wilful sin, after conviction and against knowledge, is the unpardonable sin: but this has been their infirmity and error. The sin here mentioned is a total and final apostasy, when men with a full and fixed will and resolution despise and reject Christ, the only Saviour,—despise and resist the Spirit, the only sanctifier,—and despise and renounce the gospel, the only way of salvation, and the words of eternal life;…”

Many apostles write about the continuing struggle against sin in the Christian life with no reference to ultimate and irreversible sin for the repentant sinner.

In Romans 7:22-25 the Apostle Paul writes:

“ For in my inner being I delight in God's law; but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.

What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?

Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.”

This is the struggle - in our saved soul, seeking to live a life of holiness but in our natural self, possessing the desire to sin throughout our life.

If Hebrews 10 meant that one sin after receiving the offer of salvation would damn a soul, then sections like Romans 7 would make no sense.",1647971413.0,1

If there is no sorrow, there will be no happiness either. Happiness is defined by the state of unhappiness existing, if a state of unhappiness did not exist, neither would happiness. It would just be a neutral existence with neither joy nor sadness.

Not to mention, without difficulties you never grow as a person, never change or develop, never realize important things about life.

* The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)

* Sunset Boulevard (1950)

* To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)

* Whatever Happened to Baby Jane (1962)

* Shall We Dance? (original 1996 version from Japan, not the sexualized American version)

* While You Were Sleeping (1995 comedy)

Like, that word gets overused, but seriously...  It would have been SO easy to just make ""Star Wars II"" with more whooshy pewpew action just like the original and rake in a billion more dollars, but instead they made a sequel that went against pretty much every possible audience expectation.  And with the dark tone and downer ending, it could have easily killed the burgeoning franchise.

Instead, imo, it saved Star Wars.  Star Wars couldn't have survived as just a bunch of mindless Flash Gordon throwbacks.  The way the franchise bounces between playing the pulp tropes straight, and then deconstructing them, is what keeps it interesting.",1647929964.0,22

Because nobody wanted to claim it, it basically became free for TV channels to run. Its omnipresence as filler in the 1970s created its popularity.

Akira was experimented on and eventually blew up Tokyo. They seal his remains and hid the other test subjects. During the reconstruction of Tokyo there was a Mishandling of funds and suspicion rose giving rise to protests. On the city council one council man began scheming and spreading rumors about the return of Akira creating a revivalist religion. He also funded the ""rescue"" of one of the test subjects. The rescue took place during one of the riots, and meanwhile a biker gang fight erupted on the same highway the test subject was attempting to use to escaped. The government captured the bikers assuming they were part of the resistance group that committed the rescue.

One of the bikers was injured and taken away for treatment. Contact with the rescued (#26) awaken3d Tetsuos latent powers and the government used the same test drugs used on Akira to increase F
Tetsuo's power. The drugs drive him crazy and he attacks the city. Before he attacks, Kaneda tries to rescue him from the government facility but only witnesses Tetsuo's power. Ultimately the test subjects summon the spirit of Akira who destroys Neo Tokyo again only this time we learn that the destruction is actually Him moving between dimensions or planes of existence. He takes the test subjects and Tetsuo with him. The test subjects say they may be able to return and we can hear Tetsuo claiming he is not (we assume) Akira.",1647926485.0,17

""The most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them--words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.

In ER this are called grace, and you first touch them before being able to rest at them.

The game usually tells you ""Grace discovered"" when you touch one. I assume either OP edited a screenshot or used a mod. 

This is humorous because the game frequently tells you to ""touch grace"", which is similar to the phrase ""touch grass"". Telling someone to touch grass is the current internet way to say that they send too much time inside on electronic devices and really need to go outside and see what real life is like again (implying that you have no life).",1647953173.0,1479

Let's talk about the invention of the printing press - something you might consider not overly important, but before the printing press, the Church had a monopoly on copying texts: entire orders dedicated to doing so. Books, by nature of this labor intensive process were expensive - A Personal Bible would be a reasonable gift to a new couple type deal, and would be graciously recieved. But the printing press, invented around 1436, changed everything - with the idea of it, and subtle improvements books went from unaffordable by most, to accessible to anyone with some spare coins - to the Wealthy, having something like a Bible was common place, poor families might save for a family bible. But in the end - this had a huge impact.

Over the coming decades, the monopoly of understanding the bible was taken away from the church: Anyone could read it. Anyone could spend time thinking about it, reviewing it, or - on a whim, going to other passages and considering how they fit together. And of course - cheaper, more affordable books meant literacy grew with it, as more people could afford to. No longer was literacy largely left to what you needed - but now, at least for those with a bit of extra coin, reading could be a pass time.

Fundementally - if you make the knowledge approachable, people will think about it. If you don't tell them WHAT to think about something, in the same phrase as you tell them that something - people will come to their own conclusions given time.

In the end - Religion and Capitalism are somewhat the same: If you stop to think about it, you may find what is being told to you is full of crap. 

**this gets us to the disclaimer part**

To be clear: There is a lot of good lessons to be found within the bible. It is, functionally, a collection of stories with idea's of how to live ones life to best improve and serve the community, and family that you have. If someone truely believes in the idea's as they stand - Awesome. What I generally have a problem with (and the undertones of what is written above certainly is influenced by it) is having religion flaunted and shoved in my face, like a badge of honor - a status symbol of sorts, not unlike an iPhone, or a Rolex.

The unfortunate truth I suppose, is that the Catholic Church especially has a history of covering up scandles - and how systemic, and pervasive it is, makes me wounder.

And a lot of games could benefit from it.  WD: Saints and Sinners has some neat actions where you grip/take your backpack or weapons, fasten a flashlight, climb ladders, use a bow, and so on.

But most games I've seen are still using the controls in very traditional and less interactive ways - usually just hold the controls in a certain position or aiming.  Squeezing and pulling and the throwing responsiveness, etc., would open a lot of doors for gameplay ideas!

It's nice that he makes people's day.

It may be difficult to find one of these guys/girls if you look in a shelter. Certainly not impossible, but a dog like this realistically would not be in the shelter for long before someone adopts them. There are regional corgi adoption networks if you are located in the US, but not sure about the rest of the world (my local one is called East Coast Corgi Rescue). 

Another way would be to find a reputable breeder that is AKC certified, inquire and learn about the breeder, and join a wait list for the next litter of pups. Puppy Mills are sadly in existence, so make sure you do your homework on these little guys and the breeder before moving forward.",1647948824.0,48

5083,aww,I’m serious,,1647928396.0,179,37067,0.96,PurpleK00lA1d,"He's definitely an energetic little dude. We're actually temporarily in an apartment right now after selling previous house and waiting until new build is finished.

At the house he had a lot of room to run around the house and outside and stuff and didn't really care to interact with his toys/chews too much after teething.

In an apartment now and we walk him twice a day. Short one at lunch time and a longer one on the evenings. He's taken to playing with his toys a lot more and we throw stuff around with him in the little space we have. If there's days he doesn't burn enough energy he turns into a little gremlin. Overall he's a happy pup though.

So I'd say they're fine in apartments as long as you interact with them enough and burn enough of their energy. I work from home so it's easy for me to play with him on and off during the day as well. This is him now just calm and relaxing:

Alternatively this is him when he has too much energy:

If your neighborhood has a webpage, post the pictures up, there, too.

Call some of the shelters/vets in the area. There's a chance someone called them, looking for their cat. The shelter might be able to put you in touch.

See if a local vet can check for a chip. If he has one, and it's updated, they might be able to reach the owner.

And watch the cat's response to whomever tries to claim him. You can generally tell the difference between ""hey, people"" friendly and ""hey, MY people"" friendly.

We tried PawBoost, putting in a lost report with our local humane society, checking for a microchip at an emergency vet and when our local vet opened. Walked 2 miles around the neighborhood asking if anyone had lost a pet to no avail. We ended up having him fixed and keeping him, but he was by no means anyone’s outdoor cat. I still to this day look and see if there are any missing kittens matching his description.

I think you are doing the right thing by keeping him safe and fed, but I would put feelers out there to see if it does actually belong to someone. The local humane society may be able to keep him until the owners are found. If the owners are not found you should be able to adopt.",1647970292.0,1

When she brought the cat to me she didn’t tell me where she found her or that she had a collar on when found.

I asked her if the collar had a tag and she said no and I asked if I could see it and she said she didn’t have it anymore. I freaked out and immediately had her checked for a microchip and there wasn’t one. Now I don’t particularly know if this friend of mine was trying to deceive me, but I know that my cat needed help. I found out that she was pregnant but the vet said that she was so small, giving birth would’ve been dangerous. I fully believe I saved my cat. Sometimes there are bad people out there that aren’t really taking care of the pets they have and don’t deserve them. My cat wasn’t being fed well, was not taken to the vet, and was left completely alone outside. I felt sick to my stomach about it for a while because I felt like someone out there was missing their cat, but all of my pressing questions were met with no answer and I realized that it wasn’t my fault that my friend put me in this situation, but I now had a cat that I loved and I would take care of for the rest of her life.

Instead of trying to cancel the free-flow of ideas (and jesus fucking christ we're talking about something that happened 40 years ago in the world of entertainment), why don't you just post some reasons why the commenter is wrong? The reason for my original comment is that Di'anno gave Maiden a much rougher, punk rock edge, and the first two albums had tracks that were, don't know how else to say it, much less ""precious"" than the albums that came after. Number of the Beast was actually my first Maiden concert, and saw them a once again. But, sorry, I just lost interest after that.

Self Titled is a mess. Freaky Style has some good parts but is very unrefined. Uplift is them starting to understand how to write an album but still not being able to capture their energy plus they were all high on heroin the whole time. Mother's Milk was slapped together after John had been around for 6 weeks and Chad for one week and no one was really happy with it and it shows. BSSM is where they first started to jell as a band and really collaborate but there are several misses on the album. OHM we don't talk about just like the band doesn't. Californiacation is a cumulation of them all being sober and is fantastic front to back and only held back by the poor mastering. By the Way is a John solo album with the Peppers as a backing band, nothing wrong with that it's just not a Peppers album. Stadium Arcadium is them at their absolute best, Flea being Flea, trumpets, John ripping the guitar, Chad at the top right his game, Anthony with some actual effort to sing, showing off all their styles, the mastering was good, etc. I'm with you had Josh trying too hard to be John and suffered from a lack of John's backing vocals. The Gateway felt forced and without Rubin it was a bit directionless. 

I was actually disappointed that Josh was kicked out when John rejoined because I would have loved to see what those two would have done together, despite the above Josh is a great guitarist and I like his work; he's just not John. It would have allowed them to incorporate more of the electronic music that John spent the last decade making and added an entirely new layer to their sound.",1647918058.0,9

The celebrity must be nominated, and have considerable fame in their area for at least 5 years. Out of all nominations (of which there are tons), the Chamber of Commerce then chooses around 24 a year to get a star. Once a celebrity is chosen, the person (or organization) who nominated the celebrity is responsible for paying for the cost to install the star, plus a fee for lifetime maintenance (\~$50,000 as of 2020).

TL:DR; You don't just pay money and get a star. If you're *chosen* to get a star, whoever nominated you is responsible for the cost of the star.",1647881587.0,47

In the original, the lower lip rests on the upper row of teeth, which is visually equivalent to a huge grin.  
In the ""new"" version, the lower lip no longer touches the teeth, indicating that the mouth is open. So it is no longer a smile, which looks more like a laugh.

The reason is nothing in life is truly white. There is always a reflection of the surroundings on the material. Try warming up the dress, tiara and background sparingly and you’ll find it does not detract from its whiteness, and reduce the decoupage feeling.",1647952507.0,3

Not every attempt at having a modern take on anything old is a desecration of some sort.

And maybe the photograph was taken in black and white for aesthetic purposes, maybe it was because they didn't have color film. Whatever the reason, the image would not have looked like it would have had it been taken today. And if that photographer was alive, I'd like to believe they'd see a reimagining of their work as just that -- a reimagined version matching up current technical standards rather than some sort of hostile take on their work.

I was more thinking about how colorization is always an artistic interpretation and for pre-color photography, that it’s a great way of humanizing the subject, and the only way to do so, but for photos taken in an era where color photos existed and were common, that it sort of stops being a way to humanize the past and just artistic expression.

Obviously is 1958, there aren’t two versions of this photo the way there would be now with digital. For example, I’m planning my wedding and know that it’s pretty common for people to order black and whit sprints of photos that were taken in color. That’s artistic choice. So if in the future, someone were to say, “what does that photo look like in color?”, like we have the definitive answer. It’s just the original digital file.

But in 1958, this photo is black and white and there’s no other option, but I imagine that it was a personal choice of the bride (or maybe the photographer) to use black and white. There’s almost certainly color photos of the bride in existence from this time period. So you almost lose the historical reason for colorizing. You’re left with just the artistic reason. Which again is subjective.

Maybe I’m trying to describe how images change over time. If you save a jpeg over and over it changes because of compression loss. Someone might somehow lose that original black and white photo and only have your colorized version and then say, “this photo was originally taken in black and white. I want to restore it to it’s original state.” Then later, someone loses your colorized version and now only the twice edited black and white photo exists, and then someone else with your mindset says, “let’s humanize this beautiful woman and add color back in.” If you colorized Lucille Ball, not knowing who she was, would you know she was a redhead? 

How does that change the image over time? I guess my coffee hasn’t kicked in yet and your photo got me thinking about the subject of colorization sort of tangentially.",1647965104.0,1

I have a degree in design so I've spent a lot of time photoshop manipulating images, so I get that it's the only way to get that kind of fidelity. However...

1) It's not really impossible to tell. Lots of comments here are pointing out where things are off even if they don't know specifically the techniques you're using.

2) It's not ""just pixels on an image"". The photograph, especially being one that was taken with film, captured light in that moment. The photo was created in that instant. Sure, there is an original photo and then there is the digitized version made up of pixels that the original poster created when they scanned the image, but there's a lot to be said for the authenticity of remaining as close to the original record as possible. And there's something just extra weird to me about using someone else's body parts. It's like having a bad recording of your father's last words and some voice actor/professional impersonator makes a cleaned up high bit-rate version.

Restored and Reimagined by Me (2022,,1647932861.0,331,27065,0.94,IDoArtForYou,"What you point out is something that happens with any 'restoration' per se. Most paintings we see that are restored today have remnants of the job done by restoration artists. What is lost cannot ever be fully recovered. Over time, yes it does change from how it was originally painted but nevertheless the end product justifies the vision of the original as long as the restoration attempts tried to stay true to what it was before and improvise where there just isn't any info available.

As your example of Lucille Ball, anyone worth their salt trying to do this would gather as much information as possible when trying to do restoration work like this. That's my first step indeed. In most cases I make sure I get as much info as possible on the colors / shades / tones / time period colors and etc. In the cases where there is no information, then it comes down to interpretation. And at that stage, it is where that particular journey begins.

In 1958, there were color photographs and people used then but they generally became more common in the 60's. So it's possible this particular wedding as shot in black and white and it may or may not have been an aesthetic choice. We cannot really say -- unless u/spellcaster3 knows about it and can fill us in.

\> *How does that change the image over time? I guess my coffee hasn’t kicked in yet and your photo got me thinking about the subject of colorization sort of tangentially.*

But to answer this specific question, it does and that I feel is inevitable for any image that undergoes a restoration process. But luckily given the time and age we live in and the tech we have, this doesn't have to be a destructive process anymore. One can restore and still enjoy the original at it's truest quality. So I guess that's not as much harm done.",1647966426.0,1

It is indeed like a Ship of Theseus situation. At the end of the day it really comes down to the person who wants to have this work done.

When I work on these images, it's generally people who approached me or in cases where it isn't, I make sure they see the result and then take their approval before posting it.

So I guess in that category of people, they're okay with the process and as long as the end product maintains a certain fidelity in comparison to the original, they're good with it. I guess that's where the ""category"" of people this is for falls in I guess.

But I got really into hiking trails after starting to work from home due to the pandemic. I was staying indoors way too much and went and started exploring my city's huge trail system. It has affected me in deep, joyous, almost religious ways. It made me love all who fight to preserve these places where you can go to be completely away from streets and buildings and just be out in nature for a time, while still being actually in the city. I'm blessed to live where there are bazillions of hiking trails that span the city, through a river valley where you hear no traffic, see only trees and water, and I will go hike along that for hours until I am sore as fuck. I live Downtown amid hustle and bustle yet within 30 minutes of walking I can find complete silence down in the trails. It's become very precious to me, and I do not respect people that don't respect the trails. So I like this guy even though he's fucking nuts.",1647929081.0,2

Maybe this is a truly mentally ill person who spends most of their time in the parks and has witnessed horrible atrocities, and has a totally justified suspicion that some kind of terrible fate awaits in the drainage sewers, that the police can be some of the most violent and shady people in CA, and that the L.A. river has certainly seen it’s share of body disposals. It all tracks. 

My advice: don’t be a trash type or do houl in the park 🤷🏻‍♀️you’ll be alright

EDIT: I stand by this comment. If you can perform kind acts for another without using it as social capital then you're performing a kind act for two people that day. Be humble. I imagine if I was in a terrible state of distress, perhaps have any lost family members or god forbid a child, and then a person came up to give me a free meal but first had to pose for photos with the meal to post on the internet of their good deed I'd want to throw that meal in their face. Or hell a man on the street asks for some money for his kids and I say sure but you gotta take a selfie with me first so I can post about my donation to you for all my followers.

I'm sure you're all so moved by this photo that you yourselves have already made your own donations to Ukraine now too.

You posted it because you want a positive reception, attention and compliments. And that is fine; but it also rubs a lot of people the wrong way. A selfless act ceases to be selfless when you put yourself front and center and make it about you, inviting people to look and pat you on the back.

I have issue when people do something, seemingly, just to make themselves feel good.  Example:

I was driving home and on a big intersection in my town there was a group of people (maybe 30 or so) holding *Stop the War* signs and wearing blue and yellow.  I live in a very rural part of my state in the US.  Those people are doing...what?  They are protesting a war by standing on a street corner and saying, let's stop it.  I appreciate the sentiment, but we do not have politicians coming through our space.  This isn't Russia so no one in my little town had the power to stop the war here.  Their little protest accomplished precisely...fuck all.

If they had posted a picture saying, ""Protesting the war in Ukraine. Look at all the good we did"" then I would be in the camp of asking why.

On the other hand, had that same group been raising money to buy goods for families/children in Ukraine.  Had they been in a busy walking thoroughfare asking for donations to support the people of Ukraine, that would be better.  If they then took the money they had raised and bought a shitton of groceries and took a picture saying, ""Look at all the good we did!""  I would celebrate that.  They did actual good.

This woman and her partner behind her did actual good.  They raised money, bought goods, and took them to Ukraine.  That's a helluva lot more than I have done right now.  More power to her.  If she wants someone to say, ""good job"" then I damn well will because it is a good job.  She's done an awesome thing and that should be celebrated.  Let's celebrate awesome things.",1647906550.0,6

Calling them out like this just decreases the odds of them doing it again. Give them the lauding and attention they're looking for, because to them that's the reward, and they'll keep doing it as long as that keeps happening.

I think the ice bucket challenge stuff should put this to rest. 

[source](https://www.als.net/ice-bucket-challenge/)

basically, people sharing their good deeds encourages others to do good deeds as well. There is absolutely no way ALS foundation would have raised any of that money if people weren't sharing their challenges. They have said that even the people who did the challenge but didn't actually donate helped encourage others to donate. 

Another great example is when reddit got into cleaning up places. People were posting photos of themselves cleaning up garbage. It encourage others to do the same. I suspect hundreds of bags of garbage got picked up because people saw that and thought 'I'm going to go out and do that' and wouldn't have other wise.",1647907960.0,66

when i first saw the ice bucket challenge? i didn't care that these people were only doing it for clout, or whatever; the fact of the matter is they were doing it, raising awareness, and donating money.

Rather than doing something nice themselves, they can feel like good people by focusing on the flaws of people who are actually doing something meaningful. By calling out the supposed ""selfishness"" of people taking credit for their good deeds, in their minds, they have brought those do-gooders down to a level beneath them, which soothes the uncomfortable feeling of cognitive dissonance.

That said people outright deny the stuff the news puts out, but its harder to deny stuff random individuals are putting online. Even now, people are still trying to frame Ukraine as either a nazi cull or as a attempt to stop bioweapons labs.

The ~~only~~ typical exception* to international law regarding this is if soldiers are under direct fire from those buildings by enemy combatants. The fact that all these places were bombed by artillery/missiles tells you all you need to know about how 'justified' it was. *See bottom

But it's all a moot point anyway. Russia has declared a war of aggression against Ukraine and invaded them unprovoked. It is an illegal invasion. They wouldn't have to bomb anything if they stayed within their own fucking borders.

Given Ukrainian soldiers didn't have the time or resources to setup field hospitals and military bases, it should come as no surprise that they're using adequate community infrastructure to house, brief and heal their military. You can start complaining when they're shooting artillery from the roofs of these civilian buildings but nothing until then.

I want one optional platform with country exclusive borders. Closed system. Go back to dial up if you have to, I don't care. Media, officials, and the general public need a place to avoid hostile observers and where the real public opinion can be seen. 

I want to see an existing platform freeze all existing accounts, complete real offsite registration and verification to maintain -one account per person- rules. Accounts left unclaimed get denied access and are deleted. That takes out the most harmful tools. LARPing and multi account point/like/share manipulations will die. Troll farmers will have to find real jobs. We wont need as much moderation either. 

No more punishing platforms for failing to censor. Individuals represent themselves online instead of hiding behind vpn and anon status.

>Nestlé announced earlier this month that it would suspend all exports of its products from Russia except for essential items such as baby formula.  
>  
>Nestlé also stated that it would not import Nespresso or other products into Russia, with the exception of baby formula, cereal, and therapeutic pet foods.  
>  
>Nestlé has defended its decision to remain in Russia by claiming that it will not profit from its operations there, as Ukraine increases pressure on the world’s largest food company to leave as the war escalates and casualties’ mount.

I'm not sure what else people expect them to do when it comes to doing business in Russia.

**Edit:** There seems to be a pattern in the replies so I'll say it again: Fuck Nestlé. That being said, people seem so focussed on fucking over Nestlé and getting vengeance for Ukraine that they're justifying cutting food supplies specifically intended for BABIES. That's Putin level mental gymnastics.

It doesn't matter how shitty Nestle is or how much you hate them. Anything you ask them to do at this point won't make a bigger dent in their profits. Focussing on these last few products will only negatively impact living beings who don't even understand what a country is.

It's great that people got them to this point but now turn your attention to all the other companies still dealing with Russia. I'm sure you'll find plenty of better leverage that doesn't involve taking food from babies' mouths.",1647967154.0,1

The fact that this leak happened at all is a minor PR issue that will be forgotten literally tomorrow. And the content of the leak will most likely be completely harmless and boring and of no interest to anyone here.

For those of us who know the backstory here. Lol... ""essential"".

For those of you who don't, Nestle's first big financial success came from creating baby formula that caused malnutrition and killed babies. They followed it up, by cleaning up their formula, but took to running entire multi-million dollar ad campaigns to combat the evils of breast milk. Once women shift to formula even for a brief period they lose the ability to produce milk which locks women into the product for their children. And there are still significant health concerns with the nutritional value of formulas. 

It's great for women who literally can't produce milk or outright don't want to breastfeed, but it's a corporate trap for everyone else, particularly targeting the developing world.",1647968284.0,1

Based on the inciendiary anti-Nestle comments we've seen over the past week, my impression was that they were remaining in Russia wholesale.  I was surprised to read that they're pulling out of the market with narrow exceptions for essentials.

But hey, it's the internet, and lordy we love to grab our pitchforks and join a mob.  And if we're wrong, Nestle is an evil company anyway so who cares.  I mean they *are* an evil company, but in this case I feel as if they're wearing the minimum pieces of flair for doing the okay thing.

They have not read the room that trade with Russia is over.  Period.

There will be no peace deal signed within the next few days and Russia seems like they are going to keep killing civilians.

Either way, as the days go on and greater totals are verified, the civilian casualties and stories of loss are going to become mind blowing to the world.  Russia directly targets cvilians and non-military targets and they were directly ordered to do so.  Orders they have complied with.

We must, as a nation, always reign in the darkest impulses of capitalism once the stakes become clear and people think they can profit where wholesale murder is taking place.

Russia is not to be part of the global economy again unless they, on their own, change to a very different regime and an actually democratic system of governance with legitimate checks and balances.  One that is reasonably peaceful with their neighbors.

South Korea has a much stronger and more modern military and a higher population than Ukraine and an economy larger than Russia's even before Russia got sanctioned to hell. They have a larger active military than Russia and a much larger and better trained reserve force (meaning trained at all basically). Unlike Ukraine they have been preparing for invasion for decades in case North Korea tries anything. They have superior air defenses to Ukraine and an actual navy to defend the shore.

They also don't share a land border that Russia could exploit, which is a huge factor in the Ukraine invasion. Russia started their current invasion mostly surrounding Ukraine with their own country in the north and east, Belarus on the other half of the northern border allowing Russian forces to start the invasion only 100km from Kyiv, and military forces starting their invasions in the south and east from the occupied Donbas region and Crimea, and even a few strikes from Transnistria in Ukraine's west. Any invasion of South Korea would either need to be a naval invasion which Russia lacks the capability for, or go though North Korea. Even if North Korea joined Russia in that fight the DMZ is literally the world's largest minefield and South Korea has a massive amount of defenses aimed that way. 

Then you need to consider US involvement. Unlike Ukraine, the US has a defense treaty with South Korea and a huge amount of troops there. If somehow Putin managed to even get a significant force in South Korea despite all the issues then he would be starting a war with the US and probably Japan. He can't even fight a war in Ukraine which is right next to the more developed and populated part of Russia, he would have no hope of defending Russia's east from a US onslaught let alone invading Korea from there.

Basically they best Russia could hope for in that scenario would be not starting a nuclear war with the US while getting utterly destroyed conventionally in Korea and perhaps their own far east.",1647967877.0,1

You've got to realize that when something gets replaced by automation in a capitalist economy it means that it is *profitable* to do so. Which automatically means that more money flows to the top, and either less jobs or less-paid jobs at the bottom.

IIRC the TL;DR (among that and other good articles I've read) boil down to ~six things:  

1. Replaced jobs don't tend to result in an equal number of jobs. What would have been 15 farmhands is now 1 farmhand, a tractor, and an engineer for the tractor.  
2. The requisite education and skills are not 1:1. What used to be a simple job that any child or uneducated adult could do (like being a cashier at McDonald's, for example) is now a job that must be done by someone good at math/compsci and likely with a college education (engineers working on the auto-checkout thing).  
3. Globalization means that locations are not held constant. What used to be a job for a professional seamstress in New Jersey is now a job for 3 underpaid slave children in China.  
4. The people displaced still get no help. If a nuclear plant is opened up to remove coal dependence (for example), then the coal mining town that was supplying the coal now has a bunch of jobless people who are middle-aged with no skills other than coal mining. They cannot be the nuclear physicists in the nuclear plant -- even if jobs are created 1:1 for every job lost, _those same people_ aren't the ones filling the jobs; you're trading the jobs of middle-aged people without many options for the jobs of youth who had plenty.  
5. The belief is that technological advancements result in more jobs is due to innovations with the new technology -- innovations take time, and jobs are likely to reach a pace where old jobs are eliminated faster than innovation can replace them with new jobs.  
6. AI is starting to render out even high-skill, high-intellect jobs. Technology is fundamentally changing in this regard; technology used to be more of a ""tool"" that would allow someone to leverage more work with less resources (such as a hammer, or a car), freeing up those resources to do other things. Whereas now it is in the forms of algorithms that allow you to replace the entire chain, including the person who used to need the leverage.

The answer isn't as clear as yes or no, so often just gets into a very muddy argument. 



You advance tech and now you can make more clothes in factories because it doesn't have to be all done by hand! Now you can make more clothes faster and more consistently, sell more, make more money, build more factories, hire back the people that you lost to the machines, and make more clothes! *(ignoring the impact this had on the farming industry, because wages increased in factories so people just stopped farming.. food shortages..)*

The past implies that this will happen again right?


But you need to ask the question, what happens when you don't actually need any more clothes to be made, but you make advancements that allow you to cut your work force by 90% to make them? You repeat the same process, but you don't have the space to build more factories, the world already has an excess in production of what you're making, and you can't afford the pollution levies to double your production anyway? 



Another example is, Okay sure, Industry B lost jobs in the past, but technology advancement does stuff like, creates the aeroplane and with that the entire aerospace industry! 

This I don't really have an argument against at all, maybe, if we can imagine a world where there's no need for drivers anymore, even the cars are made completely by robots, by parts delivered by driver-less lorries, if you can imagine a world where software has AI writing it, and fields of food plants and harvests itself all year round, then you can argue you can imagine lots of new industries created to replace those billions of lost jobs!

But that sure sounds like a guess to me! That's a lot of relying on hope.


The rate at which technology is increasing, will mean the next 20-30 years will make the past 100 look like nothing... 

You can't really use the past as evidence, because what we are about to see (or what I feel we are) as far as technologies effect on humanity, has never been seen before on a similar scale and pace...


Even ifff.. even if all these new industries are created, they won't be created as fast as the jobs that will be removed, there will likely be a very long period of issues, before the new industries take hold! This you can actually find evidence of in the past from any of the past industrial revolutions as I mentioned before!

For instance in a car plant most jobs that can be replaced don't require a high skill level. A couple days of training and you're good to go.

But the jobs that come with automation are far more complex. For instance: machine management, maintenance, planning or inspections. All of those jobs require a decent bit of training, which might not be so easy for a 50 year old to do.

> Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comWARSAW, March 22 - Poland said on Tuesday it had suggested to U.S. officials that Russia be excluded from the G20 group of major economies as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine and that the suggestion had received a &quot;Positive response&quot;.

> The G20 is a much broader grouping that includes India, China, Brazil and others and any move to exclude Russia could struggle to find unanimity.

> &quot;Our interlocutors expressed support for our position and declared that if gaining unanimity under the G20 to exclude Russia proves to be a problem, the U.S. could consider leaving this club and creating another alternative structure,&quot; he said.

>You need to remember that leader of political party that is current government believes that russia killed his brother

And it's been proven many times to be false, not because the Russians wouldn't want to do it, but because the theory on how it happened assumed some convoluted, high-tech, weather-altering capabilites of Russia to create vast fog to disrupt plane's visibility and increase the chances of crashing it. It's dumb tinfoil shit (not to mention it paints Russia as some kind of superpower capable of assassinating heads of states with weather, which is exactly what Russians would want others to believe) that takes weight off instances where Russia does actually assassinate people like Nemtzov, Litvinenko, Navalny(failed) or Zelensky(also failed). Look, it's easy enough to make the case you're anti-Russia because you do the easiest thing ever, say ""fuck Russia"" or ""it was Russia"" and instantly you get 5-10% more votes, but Russia has fed us enough real, gruesome and painful reasons to not forgive them over the last 300 years that making tinfoil theories up just hurts those who actually suffered from them.

There's just certain things you have to do as a military.  They aren't glamorous or sexy.  It's not Tom Cruise getting into his jet and taking off to go get the bad guy.  It's the 20000+ people that maintain the jet, order the parts, design the simulators, design and build the weapons, continually upgrade the equipment, train, train, and train more.  Just to allow that one guy to take off and fight.

That entire chain of people has to be 99% honest (nothing and no one is perfect).  They have to make sure they are doing the work.  Or the plane doesn't take off.  

When it lands, then this whole giant crew turns around and works on that jet for HOURS and DAYS to make sure it can fly again.

There's something called ""Pencil Whipping"".  It means that instead of actually making sure the equipment is there, or the training is done, you just sign off on it.  Sure, yep, it was done boss.  See, that box is checked.

It don't mean shit when you go to the freezer and there's no nuggies left.  

We always kinda assumed, since the US military is so serious about stomping on corruption (mostly) and makes sure the work is done, that Russia (our assumed peer) would do the same thing.

The cost was so terrible that Khrushchev himself announced the de-Stalinisation of the Soviet union to remove the effects of Stalin. Stalin is unfortunately an example of how ambition can lead to vile and evil actions. Stalin was manipulative and ambitious to the point that Lenin warned the Soviet party about Stalin before he died.

He is glorified in Russia because they see him as synonymous with a strong nation and a lost glory. It will be interesting to see if they know about the Holodomor and the Great Purges.

The Bengal famine was caused by a disease and the Japanese navy making it impossible to provide the relief the region needed. Even so A million tons of grain made it through between August 1943 and December 1944 by which time the famine had ended.

On 4 August 1943, when Churchill’s war cabinet first realised the enormity of the famine, it agreed that 150,000 tons of Iraqi barley and Australian wheat should be sent to Bengal, with Churchill himself insisting on 24 September that “something must be done”. Though emphatic “that Indians are not the only people who are starving in this war”, he agreed to send a further 250,000 tons, to be shipped over the next four months. 

On 7 October, Churchill told the war cabinet that one of the new viceroy’s first duties was to see to it “that famine and food difficulties were dealt with”. He wrote to Wavell the next day: “Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages.” Churchill refused a Canadian offer of 100,000 tons of food aid for Bengal because it would have taken two months to arrive, but the same war cabinet meeting resolved to seek Australian supplies instead.  By January 1944, Bengal had received a total of 130,000 tons of barley from Iraq, 80,000 tons of wheat from Australia and 10,000 from Canada, followed by a further 100,000 from Australia. Then, on 14 February 1944, Churchill called an emergency meeting of the war cabinet to see if more food aid could be sent to Bengal without wrecking Allied plans for the coming Normandy landings. “I will certainly help you all I can, but you must not ask the impossible,” Churchill telegraphed Wavell before the cabinet met.

The concept of a 'strong nation' is very subjective. Nations can be strong in a number of different areas. The Soviet union was the largest nation on the planet and it followed communist principles. It was also starting to compete in an arms race (Cold War) with the United States and its allies. 

Stalin never cared about the number of human lives lost in pursuit of his goals. It was evident from his WWII strategies of throwing Soviet troops to the various fronts with less formulated strategies as opposed to the rest of Allied forces. This became evident when Churchill went to see Stalin and told Stalin of the Allies' strategies to attack the Axis Powers from various fronts with varying military forces. This was a surprise to Stalin since his strategy was to throw more men into war.

Ultimately, the Holodomor and Great Purges were one of the consequences for what was the combination of Stalin's approaches, his dictatorship and his unending pursuit of power for the Soviet union.",1647970286.0,1

TBH, I completely ignore the critics, often times, the critics opinions will diverge from the audience. 

In my experience, critics hunt for things that are ""supposed"" to make a good movie rather than evaluate films as they are. 

Don't Look Up for example was lambasted as being too obvious by the critics on RT. Who cares if something is obvious? The X-Men vs the Brotherhood of Mutants is an obvious allegory to Malcolm X vs MLK. So what? Obvious things can be fun. 


Even then, such critiques are levied arbitrarily at films. Birdman was hailed as an artistic triumph, yet it's every bit as on the nose as Don't Look Up. I personally found Birdman to be a long, boring, slog of a film. The music was cool though.",1647957697.0,2

9343,movies,The 3 Most Disappointing Movies of 2021 Are Best Picture Nominees! - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,,1647912844.0,1700,9708,0.92,purplekiren,"Yeah, I'll go ahead and try to explain it. I'm not really sure if you're asking ""What do the people who like this movie like about it?"" or ""Why did the Academy specifically respond to this movie?"" so I'll go ahead and try to answer both.

For the former question, as someone who really loved this movie, I found it to be a really tense movie and full of really interesting character dynamics. Yes, there's the literal final shot reveal of Peter's sociopathy (which on its own I think is brilliant; final shot plot twists can so often be hacky but I think it comes across really well and rewatching the movie really illuminates how much that changes the dynamics of the story). But I also think it's really interesting how Phil's homosexuality and homophobia wasn't really trope-y; so often when that sorta thing is done it's to point out the hypocrisy of the homophobic character or in the worst cases, to attack their character which is basically making being gay pejorative. But with Phil the movie really clearly feels sympathetic for him and basically contextualizes his cruelty and abrasiveness as a survival mechanism. There's clearly a wounded element to his character and he's ultimately tragic, not villainous. I also think so many of the shifting power dynamics, like Phil suddenly taking a shine to Peter and then earnestly bonding with him or George's passivity basically leading to the wife he loves be made to feel unsafe is really interesting stuff. 

Obviously if you're not into those sorts of character dynamics, the movie isn't gonna appeal to you. I also think the movie is generally misunderstood — it's a western in setting but definitely not a traditional one narratively and the trailers made it look sorta like a slow burn thriller (which I think it kinda is, but I think it was an even slower burn than people expected, which is especially unideal for a movie 99.9% of viewers are gonna see at home instead of in a theater where there are no distractions and you can't pause it), instead being sort of an atmospheric movie that's fiendishly plotted and yet in a way where you can't really see the pieces moving until the very end when the curtains are drawn on the whole thing. I think some people also see it as ""just"" about toxic masculinity, when in reality I think it's about social norms and customs making people behave in differently toxic ways, especially when as people they really shouldn't be that way (Phil is an academic and pretty sensitive under the tough shell, and the movie is interested in asking why he has that shell without resorting to flashbacks or anything, while Peter is kinda a sociopath but also out of an interest in protecting his mother and what he holds dear in a very twisted way). I know ""watch it again"" is a tough ask for anyone who doesn't respond to a movie, but I also don't know anyone whose opinion of the movie didn't go up on a second watch, both among people who loved and didn't love it on first watch. 

The movie’s also just beautifully shot and I think the score and craft generally are fantastic. Filming in New Zealand results in this weird alien landscape that I think emphasizes the strange, contradictory and tense nature of the movie. And obviously the performances worked for me: Kodi Smit-McPhee has to play a lot of layers, someone who you can't really initially tell if he's shrinking under the weight of the men in his life or if it's legitimately rolling off of his back, Benedict Cumberbatch playing a man who's pretending to be a cowboy (and one thing that leaped out to me on rewatch is how much everyone, like the Governor, the ranch hands, and George and Rose really can see through it and is just sort of humoring him since he's smart and able-bodied enough to actually be able to do the rough and tumble stuff).

Meanwhile, as for why the Academy jumped for this movie, I think it's because it was heavily pushed by Netflix (and usually half the battle is just getting your movie broadly seen by voters), and it's also a comeback for Jane Campion after not making a movie for 12 years and especially not making a big Oscar hit for almost 30 years. It stars a guy who's a past nominee (Cumberbatch) and two actors the Academy was clearly ready to embrace (Dunst and Plemons have been doing either Oscar-worthy work or filling supporting roles in Oscar-y movies for years, and that gets you goodwill), and the movie in general emphasizes its craft heavily with a showy score and lots of big beautiful shots, which helps it feel like a prestigious, “best picture”-type movie. It also kind of interrogates/responds to the western genre (which I think any person in the industry who knows movies well would probably get a lot out of).

And none of this is to say you have to like the movie, obviously. There are people I respect the taste of who don't think it's that deep and it's definitely one of the thorniest and in some ways demanding of the viewer movies to get the sort of platform it's had in a while. But I just found it really engrossing, tense, and ultimately emotionally moving.

2019 Oscars were terrible. Star is Born is entertaining, but definitely not deserving of a best picture. The Favorite was okay, but it's my least favorite (no pun) Lanthimos movie.

But it's also a little bit true. After all, Kareem is not just some random blogger or journo struggling to make ends meet. He's a millionaire. There's a major power difference in him asking for donations/support/Patreon subscribers than if it was, well, you or me. 

I think OP had a kneejerk reaction to the request because of that. It's just not really eloquently framed.

Edit for more context: I re-read what I just wrote and wanted to add one thing. This absolutely *does not* mean that Kareem shouldn't be paid for his excellent writing. Of course he should! But the whole Patreon/GoFundMe thing came out of struggling folks trying to get others to help them in a system that gate-keeps people from writing or creating art for a living. Seeing more and more wealthy individuals, especially those who are established in the system, use that same format today is really rough. It changes the playing field once again, leaving no-name bloggers (myself included) struggling against brand recognizability. 

Not saying that this is what OP was thinking when he said it. This is now more me contemplating why I'd partially agree with them. But, at the same time, I *want* for Kareem to be able to write more and for a long time. But I don't want to compete with him for Patreon funders/donations, cause, let's face it, I'd lose instantly.",1647939263.0,53

This is the excerpt from a 2010 interview with The Village Voice.

""Q: And also, you really are roughed up by Kareem Abdul Jabbar, you know? As an untrained actor, was he a little too rough at first, or did he do all right?  
A: Well, he’s huge. And at 10 years old he was gigantic to me, he just seemed like this giant. I mean, he was really intimidating, because he’s a painfully shy guy, and I don’t think he even really totally wanted to be in the film. \[Laughs.\] So he was really just saying what he had to say and then getting out of there. Peter and everybody else made me feel very at home and welcome there, but there was no chit-chat with Kareem, and so when we went directly into him just collaring me, that was real. He was really shaking me around.""

And I can understand that. The movie looked beautiful and the progression of the story made sense, but I didn’t really care beyond curiosity. For a film that’s more than two hours long and spans such a length of the character’s life, we seemed to breeze through, at arm’s length almost.

And then look at something like Uncut Gems, where the character is unlikeable as fuck, makes stupid decisions, and even revels in the slime of his business, but the film somehow makes the audience root for him in the end.

The commentary on politics and media and reception to science was nothing new, but I think the strong performances from Streep, Hill, Perry, and Blachett helped keep it fresh.

The first couple Blade movies were just great movies with a main protagonist that happened to be black. In fact, I don't think Blade's skin color came up at all during the movies, and if so, they were subtle nods not really cringey and overt political messaging. 

These are the types of movies and roles that black characters deserve. Good movies where their skin color isn't the main attraction. Hopefully we'll get out of this skin color obsession soon and we can get back to just making good movies like the Good Ol' Days.",1647971482.0,18

It's like you read right past this. X Men had been in development since the 80's. Once Fox got it was fast tracked. Development took longer because they spent more than blade. But the Kick off was around the same time. Same with Hulk, and Spiderman. Blade was picked up in the same fire sale by Time Warner  under new line.

Considering this may be a dark movie, what principles do you go by for lighting and color grading nighttime scenes, and how do you feel about day-for-night filters?  I often find them to be too noticeable or the blue looks too fake, but maybe they're necessary for nighttime scheduling conflicts.  Are you studying techniques with shadows, fog, fire, etc.?

On a separate note, I think understated use of bass in the sound design sometimes gets overlooked as a way to build suspense you can feel.  How much of the soundscape design do you expect happens pre or post shooting in the projected timeline?

I've been a long time watcher, starting a few years ago while I was in grad school at the University of Akron.  I really appreciate your taste in movies, especially horror, and your appreciation of effort in filmmaking, whether or not the end result is amazing.

I hope anyone reading this interested in indie films and/or horror considers it.  I am glad to see someone so driven and hardworking pursue their dream and I'm happy I could contribute.

Now, as for my question, you have said many times before that the films Minority Report, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, and Signs have impacted you in such a way that it made you want to pursue filmmaking as a career, and I waned to ask you how that came to be. 

Did you start to perceive films differently afterwards? Did you become more critical and/or analytical? Did you become more knowledgeful of the filmmaking process? Did you start seeking out ways to get into the film industry? Essentially, what was your headspace during that time.

Been a long time viewer as well, watching you since my college days when yours was the only positive voice on Signs I could find on Youtube. It's been incredibly rewarding watching you grow up, get married, change your intro music a few times, and start your own film career... You've really come into your own, Teen Gohan style -- but I think the most surprising thing to learn is that you used to be a serious Christian.

I was one myself, and there are dozens of us ""ex-vangelicals"" out there (dozens!) and on behalf of all of us, I'd like to ask your thoughts on the apparent taboo seemingly against depicting the Christian religion in horror movies. Horror films have no problems borrowing from other aspects of our society, but save for the Mist by Stephen King and a couple others, there are remarkably few horror stories that have Christianity as part of the film. It's always some unnamed cult in these stories, but to many of us in our daily lives, there is a bone-chillingly real cult out there right now actively harming folks.

I'm sure this is likely done to avoid offending certain people's sensibilities, but offending sensibilities is what the horror genre is all about.

My question is: Do you intend to explore the horrors of that religion at some point, or is it something that you've washed your hands of so to speak, and never want to work with?",1647902879.0,3

I've been watching your reviews for a few years now, and you are one of the reasons why I love movies so much. You've been a joy to watch and listen to, and I'm extremely excited for Shelby Oaks! I have some questions for you:

My first question: In your opinion, out of the following movies, which one should I watch for the first time, first?

- Heat
- The Shawshank Redemption
- The Green Mile
- Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind
- Alien
- Parasite

My second question: If you were to name your three favourite Steven Spielberg movies, what would they be?

My third question: Are you taking any inspiration from certain filmmakers or certain movies? If so, who/what are they?

My fourth question: Which movie has your opinion changed the most for? 

My fifth question: Do you have a favourite movie poster? If so, what is it?

My final question: Are there certain parts of Shelby Oaks that you're really excited about bringing to life? (I would ask for details but that might ruin the surprise lol)

I hope you have a fantastic time making Shelby Oaks, and I hope you're doing great! Thank you very much for answering the questions!",1647903991.0,1

First off, as a long time fan of nearly 10 years now, thank you for all you’ve done for film criticism, and a huge congrats to you. For this film, the birth of your children, and the honesty you have always shown us. You’re one of the greats. 

My question is: With your creative aspirations being fully realized, how likely are we to see things like short films or more director inclined content on your channel as opposed to your reviews? I love your reviews, don’t get me wrong, but I’m just curious.",1647902936.0,1

   I know you are solely focused on this film and been wanting to make this. With how you talk about writing and movie making, I'd imagine you got quite a few more ideas in store brewing in your head. Don't need to know specifics obviously. Just wanna get an idea of genre and how many you could consider making depending on funding.

Congratulations on your Kickstarter Campaign. I have a couple of questions/requests.  
  
1.	You had stated in your moving forward video that you will only review movies which you loved or at least liked and felt others should watch. There are clearly some exceptions to this i.e Cowboy Bebop, Bobba fett. In your cowboy review you said you were critiquing it because it was personal to you. From this I concluded that you will be criticizing movies/series that are personal to you (if this isn’t the case I would kindly request you to clarify in a tweet or on here). I am fine with this, I would want to know though, What upcoming future content that’s personal to you will be the exceptions like cowboy bebop? I would also like to know what kind of content is personal to you in general whether its anime or spiderman or anything else.   
  
2.	This is very connected to what you stated in your moving forward video. So, before you had uploaded your squid game review, I had automatically assumed that you watched it and didn’t like it, which is why you didn’t make a video on it. I am currently assuming the same thing about The Invincible series on Amazon Prime starring JK Simmons. For trending content especially, I would like you to say/clarify something if:  
  
a.	If you haven’t watched it  
b.	If you’ve watched it, liked it but can’t make a video on it because you don’t have time  
c.	If you’ve watched it, liked it and will eventually make a video on it.

  
If you have watched said content and haven’t liked it, you can of course stay silent. I’m sorry if I’m asking too much of you here but it really confuses me personally. I don’t want to take time away from your friends and family so I feel like tweeting occasionally about a particular trending show or movie given the 3 conditions above shouldn’t take too much of your time.   
  
3.	I’ve noticed you have stopped reviewing videogames. I’m assuming it’s because you don’t have time anymore either to review/play videogames? My question is will you be reviewing videogames you like in the upcoming future?   
  
4.	Same question as above (#3) but with Anime series, not Anime movies. (i.e Demon Slayer Entertainment District Arc, Full Metal alchemist, Attack on Titan)  
  
5.	I really loved those videos where you used to react to the Academy Award nominations, I’m assuming you stopped after 2014 because you didn’t have time. Is it possible for you to do that again? I’m asking because it’s only once a year.   
  
P.S If ANY of these questions/requests have been addressed in a video I haven’t seen, I’m truly sorry for wasting your time here lol. 

  
Thank you so much for reading. I donated $1 to your Kickstarter by the way.

  
Your fan,

I’ve been watching your channel since 2015 and I’ve always been supportive of you every since I fell in love with your content. Your analysis videos on Signs and The Force Awakens completely changed how I looked at movies. Keep being awesome, Chris. Your determination to do what you love has inspired me to build a path towards becoming a game journalist, which is what I wanna do with my life. I’ve started writing blogs about games and I plan to go back to college and get my Masters degree in Creative Writing for it. Your example has made me more determined. So excited that you’re getting to make Shelby Oaks and I’ll always support the film! As far as questions go, what is your favorite shot in the history of cinema? Probably a broad question I know because there are so many that I could consider to be my favorite. The shot of Luke in Star Wars walking outside the Lars Homestead with the Twin Suns in the background. The shot of the Fellowship passing the Argonath statues in The Lord of the Rings. I always think of those, but obviously there are tons of more subtle shots that could be even better those. It makes for a great discussion. I’ve always been curious of what your opinion is on that. I’m also curious as to what your shots in Shelby Oaks will look like! I’m sure they’ll be awesome. Definitely ready for a breath of fresh air when it comes to horror and I think your film is gonna provide that for a lot of people. Cheers, friend!

I'm a huge horror fan and I can't wait to see what you can do!

I don't even know what to ask! But I'll try and come up with a few and hopefully you'll find the time to answer one or two of them.

1. Giallo and classic Italian horror. What is you take on them, briefly? I love how many of them are shot and they often feel like visual candy. But I respect views of those like Joe Bob Briggs who think they don't quite measure up to American horror and they their current popularity is... Let's say overblown.

2. What are your inspirations for Shelby Oaks? Is there a particular film or two that really inspired you to write this script? Are there any films that inspired it visually as well? 

3. As I said, I'm a huge horror fan. I love your videos and usually end up watching several horror films per week. I don't know that I have the film making or writing chops, but how would you recommend someone like me further hone this interest? Do I stick to doing what I love and just enjoy the content? What might be some ways I can expand?

Bonus. I've already mentioned Joe Bob, but I would love if you two got together at some point. For example, if you were a guest on The Last Drive-in. Is that something you could see yourself doing?",1647907284.0,1

2. This is something I think about a lot, probably more than I should. I think what has helped me thus far is that I wanted to be a filmmaker way before I started a Youtube channel. Making movies with my friends as a teenager, way before Youtube even came along. So filmmaking has always been the goal, so Youtube and the success I've found there was just a nice surprise.

Mike said, ""Rich you're a youtuber, but you're not an asshole youtuber.""

Rich: ""I got confused. I thought I was that one prick. I saw the red curtain and I thought we were that one prick."" With a picture of Jeremy Jahns, a drawing of a knight (not sure who that was), and Chris.

Mike: ""There are so many pricks out there"".

Rich: ""I can't remember his f\*\*\*\*\*...""

Jeremy said he thought it was funny, not sure about the Knight guy, and Chris posted that video addressing it. If I remember the video, Chris said he DM'ed Mike on twitter and Mike said they didn't have a problem with anybody.

The thing is some parts of the internet take RLM jokes a little too seriously. If what they joked about was true Rich Evans would have died several times over. It was a little elbow to them, but RLM weren't trying to be malicious.

The reasons for this are that first, it's politically motivated by people that are against the BBC in general. These tend to be politicians who are funded by Rupert Murdoch and/or supported by him, for whom the BBC is competition. 

There was no corporate directive to protect him within the BBC. But individuals did know that he was *extremely* well connected - the Royal Family and Prime Minister were his friends and he used them as a shield. He would have taken legal action against anyone accusing him of anything, and the fear was that *those* connections would protect him. Some of them tried to limit his access to young or vulnerable people. He was banned from Children in Need and Comic Relief, but there was only so much they could do.

Additionally, it was believed that Savile was the one person who you should take threats from seriously. He had connections with organised crime and possibly even the IRA. His driver and minder was someone that would carry out threats for him, likely including murder. 

People within the BBC weren't protecting him. They were scared of him. John Lydon and Jerry Sadowitz spoke out against him because they didn't give a shit, but that also meant they were marginalised figures too anyway. 

After his death celebrity gossip journalists revealed that Savile was the one person they had most stories about that they couldn't publish. But that was because of the combinations of the connections that Savile had - both politically and criminally.

The BBC didn't 'cover up for him'. *Individuals* within the BBC *knew* the rumours about him. But they also knew that if they spoke out then he might have them beaten or killed, and their reputations trashed as well. 

Rupert Murdoch is *very* happy to have the BBC believed to have been protecting Savile, as he wants the BBC to be shut down. Boris Johnson also accused Keir Starmer of not prosecuting Savile, in order to attempt to deflect from his own wrongdoing. 

In terms of Savile having people within the BBC threatened or killed, it is *possible* that [Jill Dando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Dando) was murdered because of her investigative journalism work coming close to finding something solid on Savile. This hasn't been proven, but is a serious line of enquiry. 

So be extremely careful of *why* anyone is bringing up Savile in order to smear anyone except Savile himself. He's (probably rightfully) a national bogey-man now, but is all too easily used as a way to attack others because of what they did or didn't do in relation to him. But it's far more complicated than that, and the 'cover-up' wasn't a conspiracy, it was individuals keeping quiet out of fear or inability to prove anything, unless they were Johnny Rotten or Sadowitz or Reverend Goatboy who had no fucks to give and who going after would have been more suspicious than just letting them sound like nutters.",1647965282.0,25

>(Irvine Welsh) maintains an interest in Savile's dubious notoriety dating back to a story in his 1996 collection Ecstasy, titled Lorraine Goes to Livingston. It features a children's television presenter named Freddy Royle, dubbed Britain's ""favourite caring, laconic uncle"", who maintains an interest in necrophilia and child abuse via his charitable sponsorship of a local hospital. The character was widely assumed to be a reference to Savile 15 years before his crimes came to light.

Welsh: 
>""I’d heard all these rumours that Savile was a necrophiliac and a serial sex abuser. I just thought they were over-the-top rumors, fisherman's tales that get spread around. But rumors are always interesting, so I thought I'd base this character on the rumors I'd heard about Savile, not really believing at the time that they were true. Now I can believe it, obviously. But as a writer I wasn’t that concerned if it was true or not. I was just interested in the idea of someone putting up this massive front of quite bland positivity, you know? He had that bland, presenter's positivity.""

Lots of people thought he was weird and creepy, but how many actually had evidence of it? From what I've read in the official reports into the case, virtually nobody had evidence of wrongdoing, and those that did were spread across different organisations over three decades so that it was never drawn together in a way that would have allowed action to be taken. Whenever this topic comes up, I always see people blaming the BBC and Stoke Mandeville for covering it all up, but I've never seen any evidence to support that sort of conclusion. That makes people uncomfortable though, far easier to blame organisations for letting it happen than accept that Savile was clever and manipulative enough to get away with it, because that means it could happen again.",1647969736.0,3

Firstly, that sounds like a fantastical exaggeration - the reports I can find give a total of 19 patients over 20 years. And secondly, he had his own keys to the place, and often visited late at night when virtually no other staff were there. The NHS report into the scandal explicitly says that he'd rape victims when he was alone with them, and the other types of assault were often committed in public in situations where the victim could not draw attention to what was happening. From what I've read about it, there wasn't any covering up as such by any of the institutions he worked with - e.g. the NHS or the BBC. Rather, Savile was hugely manipulative and planned what he was doing to minimise the chance of getting caught, combined with the general attitude (at that time in the 70s and 80s) of not trusting children when they complained and feeling unable to challenge people in positions of very considerable power.",1647966189.0,-5

That's the point I'm making. *Everybody* had heard the rumours - including Welsh. But just because there were rumours doesn't mean that there was some kind of conspiracy to cover it all up - none have ever been found that I'm aware of. Savile relied on his connections and reputation to prevent most victims coming forward. On the odd occasion that they did, the complaints didn't go anywhere because the person dealing with them was in turn pressured to make it go away because nobody wanted to go up against Savile or lose the money he raised. It was a long series of terrible decisions made by separate people, each dealing with what they thought was a one-off indiscretion or 'minor' inappropriate behaviour. There doesn't appear to be any realisation anywhere that he worked that there was a sustained pattern of abuse. Instead, each of these abuses triggered rumours amongst staff - nobody said 'oh, he raped those twelve girls at Stoke Mandeville' because nobody knew other than the individual victims and disparate staff over decades each of which dealt with one or two allegations. Instead, he groped a woman on a show, or a co-worker, and they'd tell their friends 'stay away from Savile, he's a letch and a creep' and those stories circulated. So everybody *knew* he was a creep and a weirdo, but practically nobody had any actual evidence, and certainly nobody linked those individual allegations together across multiple organisations over thirty years until after he died.",1647967615.0,3

> [In the model with the most controls] A 10% increase in teacher salary is associated with about 0.2 points (0.01 of a standard deviation) higher average math score.

Assuming that this can be extrapolated linearly (very unlikely), doubling teacher pay would increase scores by a tenth of a standard deviation, which is...something, I guess, but not much, considering the cost. And that's making the somewhat generous assumption of no diminishing returns.

Is the lowest quantile of students increasing and the rest remaining about the same?  Or are already high-performing students performing even better and everybody else is left in the dust?  I think these kinds of questions are worth answering before we can really know the full impact.

The authors did some analysis to try and get at social equity considerations, which is maybe similar to what I’m wondering about but not really the same.  Their results were mixed.  For example it’s very interesting (and maybe a little worrying) that the relationship between teacher pay and student scores does not hold in low-income districts:

I grew up in a European country where teachers were very well respected and - though they didn't make a lot of money , there was less if a wage gap between them and other professions. Our schools were VERY bare bones: just desks and chairs, a blackboard and some chalk. No supplies for students (you had to bring your own books, pencils, paper etc), no heating, no cooling, no toilet paper in the bathroom, no labs, no supplies for things like experiments, no cafeteria, no nurse, no library, no study spaces. The only ""extra"" we had was a gym with volleyball nets, a few balls and some old mats. I think there was one tv on wheels that was used occasionally to show an old tape and one slightly larger room for assemblies.
I don't think this would work in a place with students with significant special needs, but the lack of supplies was never something that was perceived as detrimental to our learning, just to our comfort.

 *  72% of funding is Direct Services to Schools. Slightly Half of that is Teacher Pay. Average base salary of $73,103
* The Student to teacher ratio has an average of 13 - 1. 
* New York City's 207 library branches provide world class access to resources to help. And a metro system free to students provides access around the city.

And the **Los Angeles Unified School District** is the 2nd Largest School District after NYC and spends $22,000 per student

School districts and charter schools with ""higher need"" students get more money to invest in those students. 

* Districts receive 20% additional “Supplemental Funding” per student for students with higher needs; children Learning English, in poverty, or in foster care.

Who says they don't already get paid close to this (in some places)?

Let's do some math for you.  In NY state, the average teacher salary is $65,000.  Woah! that's way under that 6 figure salary you say? But that's a ten-month salary (or getting paid 65/(10/12) or about $83000 in equivalent salary).  

But yeah I get they aren't making $83,000 actual take home right?  So here's some more math for you.  If you took early retirement at 50% of that salary and 55 years of age?  Well that would be an additional 415,000 dollars of income, *that you are paid for after the fact.*  Or think of it another way, it would be an additional $13,000 of income per year earned, so it's about $78,000 for 10 months.  None of this includes social security.  Add to it NY teachers benefits cost way less out of pocket.  So while take home pay is not six figures, there's some real tangible benefits to being a teacher that the average person making the same salary doesn't get.

Teachers are paid only for the 180 days they work per year and are forced to take their paychecks over a 12 month period. 

I am not paid for Winter break, spring break, summer, or ANY holiday during the year. I am paid for 180 days of work. And on top of that, due to my contract, I’m not allowed to take a similar position elsewhere to supplement like tutoring in a nearby district or working summer school for another district. That would be in direct violation of my contract. And I’m not allowed to tutor within my own district or offer the service privately. 

Which is why you see so many teachers working retail or summer school within their district. Anything within our field isn’t allowed due to our contacts. 

If we were paid the same way other professionals were with paid vacation or even allowed to work outside our district, we’d be making a much higher salary. Comparable to what you see most private sector jobs offering.

My only counter to the mechanism (high pay -> good talent -> better student outcomes) is that teacher's unions make it hard to use the firing mechanism to encourage good performance. I would think high pay with little risk to doing a poor job would allow highly paid teachers to coast (so some kind of ""rent"" extraction).

This is why no one respects sociology. The conclusion says:

>Our findings consistently show a significantly positive association between teacher base salary and districts’ performance. We find that both mathematics and English test scores are significantly higher in districts that offer a higher base salary to teachers, compared to those in districts with a lower teacher base salary. In both state fixed effects and multilevel models, we find that a 10% increase in teacher salary is associated with an increase of about 0.2 points in test scores in both subjects.

An *honest* conclusion would be, ""Given the inescapable variability of using statistical equations to try and account for so many confounding factors, a positive but statistically insignificant correlation was found between teacher salary and student performance.""

But that doesn't fit the authors' political narrative. They went out to find proof of their beliefs, and they worked the numbers until they found it.

All model specifications show significantly positive association between teacher base salary and districts’ math performance. In model (1), the correlation coefficient between the log of base salary and math test scores is about 10.5, indicating that a 10% increase in teacher base salary is associated with a 1.05 higher average math test score. When normalized, this is equivalent to about one-tenth of a standard deviation in district average math test scores. We control for district characteristics in model (2). The coefficient for base salary substantially falls to about 4, but it remains significant at the 1% significance level. After controlling for community characteristics in the regression in model (3), and adding average teacher attributes as additional control variables in model (4), the coefficients for teacher salary are cut in half, but the significance is still intact. A 10% increase in teacher salary is associated with about 0.2 points (0.01 of a standard deviation) higher average math score.""

This goes for most industries, IMO - you’re half useless when you get out of school, and I don’t really think it’s realistic to expect that to significantly change. Actual work experience needs to be considered hand-in-hand with education, and while that should be considered in restructuring how higher Ed works it should also just be assumed that you need X number of years in the job before you’re truly qualified to be working in an unsupervised position.

All of which is to say, we should have more robust mentoring and early career training - and be encouraging these teachers to stay on the job.

For those unaware, statistically significant means that it is unlikely that we would receive results more extreme than what we see in the data if our null hypothesis is true.

That means in this case, we can say with some degree of certainty that there is a correlation between test scores and teacher salary. The null hypothesis was that the two are uncorrelated, and based on the data that was collected, it is unlikely that that is the case. That is ALL that ""significant"" tells us. It says nothing of the magnitude or direction of the correlation. In this case it's a fairly small positive correlation, meaning that as salary increases, average test scores tend to increase slightly as well.

At the best public school, I still had a few teachers who were.... not great.  But every student *wanted* to be there and wanted to do well, and so the learning environment was amazing.   We collaborated, and if we got off topic in a class, it wasn't because the one girl was whining that she didn't understand a lesson for the entire hour... it was because we were debating with the teacher or each other in legitimate Socratic fashion.

The research team – led by Jorie Clark of Oregon State University and including Dr Dylan Rood and Louise Guillaume of Imperial College London’s Department of Earth Science and Engineering (ESE) – found that the corridor between the two ice sheets did not open fully until about 13,800 years ago, when the two ice sheets covering much of North America melted and retreated.

Dr Dylan Rood said: ""We have closed the door on the ice-free corridor. This research makes it clear that the corridor wouldn’t have been available as a migration route back when people first entered the Americas some 2,000 years earlier, putting the Clovis First theory to rest.""

This approach has been used [previously](https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/can-brain-training-help-manage-adhd-350366) in BCI research, where subjects, upon being shown their cell firing rate on a screen, gain the ability to modulate it.

Gut health is extremely important and with the wealth of issues hitting the public around inflammation and bacterial overgrowths it's cool to see what's really a 'new angle' on treating these. 

For context, currently we try to affect the intestines via chemicals and not all of them are easy to deliver to the right place because of stomach acid etc. Also a lot of solutions to 'heal' the gut are very slow and very diet-constricted. Such as taking specific amino acids and proteins that help rebuild tissue. What's common is one may take L-Glutamine or collagen to help heal but eat something in their diet soon after which aggravates it again. Healing the gut can take a long long time so the longer one has to be on a specific diet and take 1 step forward with supplements, it's easier to have a relapse and eat the wrong thing and take 2 steps backwards. 

Being able to target and transplant parts of the gut opens up a lot more efficient techniques to affect overall health which compliment the current tools nicely.",1647967931.0,1

People lose control of their muscles, and communication may become impossible. But with the help of an implanted device that reads his brain signals, a man in this “complete” locked-in state could select letters and form sentences, researchers report this week.

“People have really doubted whether this was even feasible,” says Mariska Vansteensel, a brain-computer interface researcher at the University Medical Center Utrecht who was not involved in the study, published in Nature Communications. If the new spelling system proves reliable for all people who are completely locked in—and if it can be made more efficient and affordable—it might allow thousands of people to reconnect to their families and care teams, says Reinhold Scherer, a neural engineer at the University of Essex.

ALS destroys the nerves that control movement, and most patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. When a person with ALS can no longer speak, they can use an eye-tracking camera to select letters on a screen. Later in the disease’s progression, they can answer yes-or-no questions with subtle eye movements. But if a person chooses to prolong their life with a ventilator, they may spend months or years able to hear but not communicate.

For most of history, leaving land and materials unproductive and unused for the sake of sentiment was unthinkable, and even when it became more practical to not dismantle old structures for materials or to leave some piece of land unproductive in the late 18th and 19th centuries there was a pervasive ideology, especially among the powerful, of out with the old and in with the new, they saw no good reason why some ancient and decrepit structure shouldn’t be replaced by a more modern building.

With the exception of a few works of art that were deliberately preserved through the patronage of individuals, or a few structures that remained useful and were constantly renovated like the Tower of London, Pons Fabricius, the Pont du Gard, the Trierer Dom, Prague Castle, the Hagia Sofia, the Basilica of San Lorenzo Maggiore etc many of the ancient structures and ruins that we have exist because of historical accidents. For instance, the relatively pristine 1400 year old Anglo-Saxon church in Escomb, Co Durham remains standing because the village of Escomb was too poor, small and obscure to build themselves a new church or for the Bishop of Durham to have a new church built for them; the temple complex at Memphis remains partially intact because better sources of stone were found closer to Fustat; Le Marais was a ghetto built on soft, unstable marshland and so the bastard Haussmann didn’t think it worth the time, effort or money to “renovate” it like he ~~renovated~~ *ruined* most of Paris; Pompeii was totally encased in rock and ash etc.",1647958469.0,18

Romans maintained these structures, and it was expensive. Aqueducts had miles of tunnels with access hatches where someone has to go around and clean it - miss this for a few years and it's all going to shit. As such, aqueducts were only for big cities, farms, and industrial sites - most people had cisterns and wells - Rome had 11 for a million people. Rebuilding was resource intensive, probably required concrete, needed trained engineers, and tons of human labor (slaves or soldiers). Once the aqueduct has been breached, the area around the damage turned into swamps that were difficult to work in. So, once your city has been sacked, most of your labor force is dead, and your resource needs have been reduced, you don't have the time or need to go fix the aqueduct.

Great comment - just wondering if you mean literally millions in contemporary Roman currency or were just using it as a figure of speech (as in, it was considerably over budget)

Only asking because the thought of comparing Denariis (or the like) to modern currency with transitive value seems like a very interesting experiment that wouldn't ultimately be possible lol.  (Haven't thought about it a ton though, nor do I know that much about the evolution of European currencies from Rome--> Now, so I could be wrong!)

I'm from the UK, and the modern cathedral in the town over was built in the 13th century, but the site has been home to *a* cathedral since the sixth or seventh century.

Where I live today, the main road is situated next to a castle that underwent renovations circa 1850, where they found the remains of the old Roman walls at their base. They built the new walls on top of the old Roman ones and lined the difference in red brick so you can see the Roman ""foundation"" that the more modern castle is built upon. The keep itself dates back to pre-Norman times, but since most keeps were built of wood, the modern stone Keep was ""only"" built in the twelfth century.

This means that most people who drive through the city will see Roman stonework opposite a modern shopping centre.

The most common place we regularly interact with old buildings are pubs - public houses have been a part of British culture since time immemorial, and so you will often find one or more pubs that have been in constant operation for over five hundred years.

""Roman civilization"" cannot be so easily compared to ""Medieval European civilization"" however. In part because both things describe a lot of different places over a long period of time. ""Roman civilization"" in Italy under Augustus is probably what we imagine when we use the term, but Gaul under Severus was undeniably a part of it too, and the people there and then certainly wouldn't have seen themselves as part of something different. Ditto Europe; it's never been one cohesive thing, but you could describe ""Christendom"" or ""the European market"" or the comingled noble families across the continent as collective entities, with each fiefdom as a node in a greater whole.

Technological progress didn't reverse. Roman architecture and mechanical engineering didn't disappear; rather, the administrative capacity for centralized planning and the capital for monumental projects diminished. The money and attention given to creating more advanced weapons, armor, and military doctrine was absolutely there, and those really were generally superior to earlier Roman equivalents.

And the people living at the time likely wouldn't have seen their culture as a degradation of something older and better. From their perspective the Church was the institution most associated with cultural life, and it was stronger than it had ever been under imperial rule; they may have looked back at the Empire as  being tainted by its pagan origins.

The Dark ages a) only applies to Western Europe and ignores continued advancements in Byzantium and further east (China, Persia, Baghdad, etc)

This is incredibly misunderstood pop-history. 

The concept of the medieval ""Dark Age"" has long been rejected by historians (you can't simultaneously have a Dark Age and [three medieval renaissances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_renaissances)) as an artifact of the Early Modern Period (where the concept of the medieval dark age first appeared). The term was created to ""separate"" the (at the time) modern European society with the perceived ignorance and barbarity of the preceding medieval period. The reality is there was continuous development of art, science, and technology during that supposed ""Dark Age"", but these developments were characteristic of the *rural* societies that developed following the collapse of central Roman authority. 

The burning of the Library of Alexandria has been *ridiculously* blown out of proportion by pop-history. The reality is the Library, while impressive at one time, was only one such center in the ancient world, and was in steep decline when it was destroyed. It was also one of the major producers of copies, which were disseminated throughout the ancient world, meaning it was not the only location to view its contents. The Library, when it was burned, was a century past its prime and was no longer considered a ""world-class"" center of learning of the classical world.

Finally, the fall of the Roman Empire, as it is understood by historians now, is characterized for more accurately as a *transition* and not a *decline*. Urban society declined, yes, but it was replaced by vibrant rural societies who continued many of the traditions of the Romans. Being rural societies, however, meant they a) did not have strong central power structures required to organize large-scale public works and b) they had no *need* to construct such large-scale works, when the communities they lived in were small rural ones.

EDIT: One quick aside; while historians generally agree that the *medieval* ""Dark Age"" didn't actually exist and is an artifact of the Early Modern Period, *dark ages* in general are a thing. The [Greek Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Dark_Ages) are generally accepted as being an actual ""Dark Age"", as it followed immediately after the Bronze Age collapse and appears to have experienced a notable and steep decline in cultural, societal, and technological complexity that did not reappear in Greece until the Archaic period some 400-500 years later.",1647964659.0,9

The knowledge of Roman architecture and engineering wasn't particularly lost, it's just that nobody could afford to build those kinds of grand structures at the time. The late western Roman empire could barely afford to keep a field army let alone recreate some of the great structures from a couple hundred years prior. After the collapse, it was all but an impossibility, but not from lack of technical know-how. It was lack of wealth and collapse of trade networks. As an example, I personally couldn't rebuild the coliseum today even with all the knowledge on how it was done. I simply don't have the manpower or money to make it happen. It doesn't mean I'm less advanced than the Romans. It just means I don't have the organizational structure, money, or will to pull it off. My state, however, could probably do it. But why haven't we? Our priorities have shifted.

Regarding lost knowledge, it was just stuff that wasn't important at the time that fell out of use. We forgot how to do it, but it doesn't mean that we were incapable of it if the need re-arose.

Losing specific crafts or branches of technology doesn't imply to me that technology as a whole was stagnant or regressing.

It's popularly conceived that if the Roman Empire hadn't split, humanity as a whole would have advanced dramatically further in the next millennium then it did, and I don't believe that is an accurate sentiment, regardless of losing a specific technology or two for even centuries. 

In this context by the way, glass making and concrete were not lost to humanity, only to Western Europe, as both continued in Byzantium.

But that is what *they* meant.

Anyway, I think you're wrong. Firstly, a lot of those events are far too overblown. It's now accepted that the Qin did not perpetrate some huge destruction of knowledge, and that's just Han propaganda. Secondly, the destruction of written histories doesn't equate to any loss in technology at all. In the time periods you're discussing, written records have very little to do with technology.

How are you this confidently wrong? 

If you can name me 3 reputable historians who think that ""Lincoln would have been impeached instead of Johnson,"" I will Venmo you $50 dollars. Johnson was impeached by radical republicans who loved Lincoln. They hated Johnson because he kept vetoing reconstruction legislation that Lincoln would have championed. He also clashed with Lincoln's cabinet who had grown to love him. 

Also, congrats on cherry-picking Lincoln's life into the most racially cynical narrative you could invent lol. 

James McPherson has a nice short biography of Lincoln. Maybe you should try reading it to be better informed. [https://www.amazon.com/Abraham-Lincoln-James-M-McPherson/dp/0195374525](https://www.amazon.com/Abraham-Lincoln-James-M-McPherson/dp/0195374525)

He seems reputable.

Eric Foner plays with the idea and he is a well accredited historian.

Adam I.P. Smith has something to that effect as well. He is a well published author with 8 books and many of them on the politics of the civil war and Lincoln specifically.

Its a racist ideology. Certain folks that dont look like me 🤷🏼‍♂️.... decided that curly hair and dark features looked unprofessional a long time ago as an offshoot of emperialism and racism. 

Thats the basics. But yeah...and nah... I'm not shaving my beard and getting ingrown hairs and fucking my skin up to appease an arbitrary race related standard of professionalism. Why can't the standard of professionalism be long dreadlocks, a thick beard, and handhake-hugs that we do (see: key and peel skit)?


My hair is in its natural state. Beard and locs.. If that was unprofessional to you before reading this, you were supporting a racist paradigm. If IT'S STILL unprofessional to you after reading this, congrats, you're a racist. Its okay. All of America is racist by design. You'll be okay. 


**The baseball player that was being paid to endorse hair care products designed for his hair and his people was a professional athlete**.... the Yankees denied him cultural representation when they had him cut his afro. Then paid him a hush fee. Thats racism. Cut and dry.

Likewise, you didn’t mention the other part of what I said - *uniform* - which means they want the entire team to appear in common dress and appearance. The yankees don’t have names on their jerseys when they play. They instill plenty of rules within the franchise to focus more on the team and less on the individual.

It's like someone says to you ""you got two hours, put this 1000 piece puzzle together"". You're so limited in time to understand the theory, the concept, the techniques, the philosophy behind all these art pieces. 90% of everything just goes over your head. Then you're told to create something completely original using such techniques. All of this needs to be done in three or four weeks. 

Your mind starts doing mental gymnastics, it starts overwhelming itself with anxiety, with doubt and fear. Then once the due date comes up, you're so sick and tired of it all that you don't care anymore. Then, depending on your teacher, they'll look at it and start picking the little mistakes or missed opportunities on your art piece. But, you're so dead inside, you don't care anymore. 

What's worse, arts schools are incredibly expensive and sometimes hard to get into them.

There's an article by an ex cop and coroner [here](http://dyingwords.net/did-vincent-van-gogh-really-commit-suicide/) which suggests the suicide theory didn't surface until the 1950's, more than half a century after his death:

> **The first strong suicide suggestion came in 1956 with Irving Stone’s novel and movie Lust For Life**. It was a documentary that took liberty with Van Gogh’s life and times. It concluded Van Gogh was a troubled soul—a beautiful soul—who ended his life intentionally. **The book and movie were bestselling blockbusters and cemented the suicide seed to an adoring public**. It became ingrained in lore and public acceptance that Vincent Van Gogh was a despondent psychotic who suddenly up and killed himself rather than continue a tormented existence of interpreting beauty in nature and people.


> The researchers, Pulitzer Prize winners Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith who co-wrote **Van Gogh: The Life**... sourced a leading expert on firearms and gunshot wounds who refuted any chance of Van Gogh being able to discharge a firearm with his own hands that could have caused the wound in its documented location.


> Naifeh and Smith address this in their book with this quote: *""When all this began to emerge from our research, a curator at the Van Gogh Museum predicted the fate that would befall such a blasphemy on the Van Gogh gospel. 'I think it would be like Vincent to protect the boys and take the ‘accident’ as an unexpected way out of his burdened life,” he agreed in an e-mail. “But I think the biggest problem you’ll find after publishing your theory is that the suicide is more or less printed in the brains of past and present generations and has become a sort of self-evident truth. Vincent’s suicide has become the grand finale of the story of the martyr for art, it’s his crown of thorns.'”*

In any case, there's apparently sufficient evidence to cast doubt on whether it was ever unequivocally ruled suicide.  It's possible that it was, but it's not as certain as commonly represented.  I believe this is why contemporary creators are beginning to challenge the narrative.",1647937871.0,8

Im not sure how much I really believe that. That its a random thing where it takes someone decades and another person a handful of years.
Like yes its true between individuals, but I dont think its a random thing you cant change.
Those who learn it in a handful of years learn how to think and learn and change. I think thats probably the difference, while decades is more of brute forcing it.
Also does depend on what skill I guess. Like Olympian Athlete? Yeah that takes both circumstances and natural body related things.

So many examples. Mondrian had to sell paintings of flowers to stay afloat in the early and middle years. Ensor lived with his mom.

Art depends on muscle movements and coordination in the same way a lot of sports do. Some people naturally have better hand eye coordination and eyesight.

There's no difference between these tasks and sport in terms of natural aptitude. Passion also affects a lot and can't be forced or chosen.

I've seen people who can pick up a guitar a play something beautiful within 5 minutes of touching an instrument for the first time (as in they never played another instrument before).

I mean yeah. Like some people naturally have better coordination and eyesight. But those are things that can be trained. To get at an expert level or photo realistic drawing sense for example, doesn’t take specially gifted talent. It’s a skill anyone can learn, if they truly have passion to do so and can force themselves to think. 

Like not everyone can be the best at everything. But anyone can become good at almost anything. The real thing is desire.

Edit: to add into this, it's crazy to me that people here consider Van Gogh to have been ""discovered"" after his death. His sister in law, [Johanna Gezina van Gogh-Bonger,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_van_Gogh-Bonger#:~:text=Johanna%20Gezina%20van%20Gogh%2DBonger,the%20growth%20of%20Vincent's%20fame.) read his journals and fell in love with his story. She became obsessed with trying to share it with the world. Not a lot of people know the work she did and unknowingly undermine her all her accomplishments, although she may have preferred it that way as it was never supposed to be about her, it was her desire for the world to know Van Gogh. Hell, I went to a special Van Gogh exhibit in my city last year and Johanna might have been mentioned once in passing in the whole thing. She was a grade school English teacher, and was multilingual, using this she was able to negotiate with gallery owners all over Europe personal in their native language, trying to arrange art shows. She faced a lot tremendous hurdles. First off, being a woman. Woman didn't sell art or negotiate in business like that and she was treated more like a novelty and at best humored, but that allowed her to get a foot in the door of the art world. Van Goghs paintings were emotional in a time nobody was interested in that, but Johanna didn't just sell the paintings, she sold the story of his short and tragic life as a package. You couldn't just experience the art without understanding the artist. Once things got going she was able to put on her own shows selling paintings but smartly keeping the best ones for herself, as if to say, you too can own a Van Gogh, but not the best ones. Van Gogh had a very short career but painted furiously so there were a lot of paintings. Johanna actually sold his most iconic work, Starry Night, not thinking much of it but later bought it back from the patron.

If you're interested in more detailed information, this is where I first learned about her story.

And he really did believe his brother was very talented and had a future in art. He supported Vincent his whole life and named his son after him so she was honouring his wishes. The couple didn't have long together before tragedy struck. Theo and Johanna got married in April 1889, their son named Vincent was born in January 1889, Vincent died in July 1890, and Theo died in January 1890. She was left a poor widow and single mother with two hundred worthless paintings in her little Paris apartment. 

She sort of knew some people in the art world in the Netherlands so she moved back to her homeland, tracked down the rest of the paintings, started organizing exhibitions. Along with showing the paintings, she also published Vincent's and Theo's correspondence, Theo kept every single scrap he got from Vincent while Vincent was less organized. That's why we know so much about Vincent's daily routine and artistic process. By giving Vincent a place in history she also got his brother, her husband, a place in history. Theo genuinely supported Vincent's dreams and actively tried to help his brother develop artistically, including introducing him to Ganguin who Theo also financially supported. 

The art critic Richard Roland Holst said this about an 1892 exhibition: ""Mrs Van Gogh is a charming little woman, but it irritates me when someone gushes fanatically on a subject she knows nothing about, and although blinded by sentimentality still thinks she is adopting a strictly critical attitude.  ... The work that Mrs Van Gogh would like best is the one that was the most bombastic and sentimental, the one that made her shed the most tears; she forgets that her sorrow is turning Vincent into a god."" 

It seems Vincent's art really spoke to her in a time of grief. I think the fact his art is often so bombastic and sentimental, though he can also be understated, is why so many people have connected to his art. It speaks to people and make people feel emotions. And it could be why it was regarded with suspicion when it was new, because it seemed uncouth and wild.",1647934390.0,23

I stopped smoking and took up vaping almost 8 years ago. I've wittled my nicotine levels from 18mg down to 1-3mg I just can't kick that last 1mg which is annoying.  

The problem is i've had 5 bottles of juice on my side and i fill them one at a time with nicotine as i get to use them and one day i forgot to add nicotine to a bottle. I vaped for 2 days without nicotine and while i vaped more often i was fine. Then my wife found the two bottles of nicotine in the draw and told me about them. I almost had a panic attack and added them to my juice. The moment i knew it wasn't in the juice i just didn't feel right. I was agitated until i got that nicotine hit.  

It drove me nuts knowing if my wife hadn't have said anything that week would've been my week of nicotine free vaping and i could've kicked the habbit all together.

For example, this is what one patient (who used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day) said after the stroke:

>N. smoked his last cigarette on the evening before his stroke. When asked about his reason for quitting smoking, he stated simply, “I forgot that I was a smoker.” When asked to elaborate, he said that he did not forget the fact that he was a smoker but rather that “my body forgot the urge to smoke.” He felt no urge to smoke during his hospital stay, even though he had the opportunity to go outside to smoke. His wife was surprised by the fact that he did not want to smoke in the hospital, given the degree of his prior addiction. N. recalled how his roommate in the hospital would frequently go outside to smoke and that he was so disgusted by the smell upon his roommate’s return that he asked to change rooms. He volunteered that smoking in his dreams, which used to be pleasurable before his stroke, was now disgusting. N. stated that, although he ultimately came to believe that his stroke was caused in some way by smoking, suffering a stroke was not the reason why he quit. In fact, he did not recall ever making any effort to stop smoking. Instead, it seemed to him that he had spontaneously lost all interest in smoking.

Trust me, this is something most addicts think about themselves in the beginning. 

That said, there's way too many stereotypes and stigma revolving around 'addiction'. Most people think addiction always has to do with being completely shitfaced, or completely coked-up or super high. That you automatically look like shit/behave like shit. Have serious health problems, money problems, etc...

Most addicts can easily fly under the radar when it comes to all those negative stereotypes.  They don't have any of the typical ""addiction problems"", which is why they don't identify as addicts.

Edit: for the initial craving find a steam bath or fill the bottom of your tub with cool water and run straight hot water to it and sit for a few minutes breathing the steam in. You'll hack up a lung but you'll also bring a lot of the most recent nicotine out and if you're sweating that'll help more. Then you'll have to find something to busy yourself
