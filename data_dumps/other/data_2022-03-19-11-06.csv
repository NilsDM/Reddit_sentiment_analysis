Being trapped in a wheelchair for the rest of my damn life is just not worth it. The surgeons told me that everything would be ok, they gave me hope, only to crush it under the soles of their feet and watch me destroy myself. They lied to me! They didn't know what it felt like! I thought I could handle my emotions, control them, contain them, prove them all wrong, but I was just too weak. I let it slip through my fingers, out of my grip. It poisoned me, it clouded my mind. They didn't know anything, they only feel the cold touch of their knives! They gave me antidepressants. It helped me think clearly, to see things through. I took a couple of extra pills this afternoon, they showed me what I had to do in this... short moment of clarity. They showed me that there was noone and nothing worth living for. They showed me how fake Sophie and my doctor were, how they were laughing at me behind their masks when I wasn't looking. Laughing at me, my legs, thinking that they are so good, that they are better than me. Pretending that they care about me, it's all bullshit! The pills showed me the truth today, they always did. They opened my eyes, they gave me wisdom, and I acted upon it. So I had to kill Sophie and my doctor..., my... ""mentor"", my ""counsellor"". Heh. I had to take them down with me. They're not laughing any more! Oh I wish I could've taken everybody with me, but unfortunately, my situation makes that impossible. To whoever is reading this: I hope my dead body will haunt you forever. Have fun scraping my brains off the wall.

Fuck you.

She used to say that she and my dad once went to a Halloween party wearing each other's clothes in a switched gender role thing.  That some of his fellow Navy Seamen mates were hitting on him too that night at the party.  I always thought it was a joke, because I could never see this big, black, buff macho dad of mine doing anything like that. Color me surprised when I'm hanging out with my dad this recent Christmas and he shows me an old photo with him in drag, with a wig, general make-up and bright lipstick beside my mom dressed in his clubbing clothes.

I've cross-dressed and worn women's clothes before in secret (at home) when I get in the mood to do so, but I was genuinely shocked to see that moment of my dad immortalized in a photo.  Dude had bigger balls than me to actually wear that outfit to a Navy Halloween party.",1647674481.0,125

Turns out the reason this never happened to me is that usually they went together (dudes) whereas I nearly every single time I went out it was because I was persuaded by one of like 3 female friends all of which were hot and had hot friends, so I usually showed up at the door in a small group that was over 75% sexy young women.

My friends and I would go out to bars pretty often, and most had a 'dress code'.

I would get in every single time, no matter what I was wearing.  I am of German descent, and I fit right in with the locals.

My friends were black guys, and evidently, they just didn't know how to dress at all, because not matter what they wore, they never passed the dress code test.  And really, they dressed 10 times nicer than I did, no doubt.

I don't know if it was to keep Americans out, or to keep black guys out- but we ended up spending a lot of nights just walking around because we didn't want to go to the same crappy clubs that were the only ones that let my friends in.

First you get a thick log, maybe one and a half fists thick. Then you carve the tip into a blunt bullet shape. Too sharp and the spike will go through the victim too fast. Too blunt, and the victim won't be properly impaled.    

You grease up the spike with lard. You insert the bullet shaped end into the victim's anus. You push it in to at least a foot or more is in the victim. Then you haul them up.   

If you've calculated everything right, then the victim will remain alive, twitching, and completely unable to stop what is happening to him *or her* (yes this happened to women too) for days. Ultimately, the spike will erupt from the upper chest, back, or head. Fortunately, the victim will have died before then.

And he said that a man who had done such things was worth much. The rest of the Turks were dumbfounded when they saw the multitude of men on the stakes.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Nanking should be remembered not only for the number of people slaughtered but for the cruel manner in which many met their deaths. Chinese men were used for bayonet practice and in decapitation contests. An estimated 20,000 ‚Äì 80,000 Chinese women were raped. Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, and nail them alive to walls. Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs, and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them get torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified, one proclaiming the massacre to be the work of bestial machinery.‚Äù[5]",1647678545.0,802

>‚ÄúIn all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:  
  
1. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor‚Äôd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.  
  
2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.  
  
3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc‚Äôd may be attended with much Inconvenience.  
  
4. Because thro‚Äô more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin‚Äôd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.  
  
5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.  
  
6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.  
  
7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.  
  
8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!‚Äù

¬´¬†My sweet little whorish Nora,

I did as you told me, you dirty little girl, and pulled myself off twice when I read your letter. I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora‚Äôs fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.¬†¬ª

They had a reputation as the strongest land power partially due to being one of the few poleis with a professional army, and specially due to the large network of allies that supported them. Later they had their asses kicked hardly by Thebes, and they lost that network, so they never recovered from that. 

They weren't particularly fearsome. Also, contrary to the popular belief, their training consisted in many other activities, like music. The agoge was probably more designed to make good citizens than good soldiers. 

What makes Sparta particular is how harsh and controlling their society was, regarding citizens. There's accounts of Spartans partying and getting loose on the rare occasion that they weren't in their own territory. 

My personal impression is that it was a very conservative power, socially and politically speaking. They valued stability to a fault. They were very afraid to lose their system of alliances, and specially of an helot (serf/lower class) rebellion, which was their backbone. Staying too much time outside the Peloponnese could mean that Sparta would be burn to the ground when you returned. 

By contrast, Athens, the ""democratic"" power, was far more imperialist and aggressive than people assume. They were more hostile against the Persians, and they also engaged in far riskier campaigns against other Greeks. Their status as an economic major power, their higher personal wealth, their cosmopolitan culture, the strength of their navy, and their tendency to fight in wars far away reminds me of the modern US. 

There's been a lot said about how Sparta treated the Helots, but from what it seems, they had considerably more right than a slave. The fact that they were so afraid of a rebellion shows that they hold a fair degree of power, compared to a slave. 

By contrast, one of the major strenghts of Athenian economy, their silver Drachma, was built on the work of mining slaves, which was probably one of the most brutal conditions in ancient history.

Apparently the plant may have been recently rediscovered in Greece (not it's native range). About a dozen plants were found in various ancient walled orchards. The plant matches descriptions from antiquity including: seed shape, resin color and smell, rough growth pattern, growing requirements, etc. As a bonus, it contains a bunch of previously unknown bioactive compounds. The team that discovered it successfully got about half a dozen to sprout and have transplanted them back into the area they found them, as well as keeping a few for research. There are very few known samples, and with it's supposed aphrodisiac qualities they are worried people will start harvesting the few wild plants for penis pills.

The trick to growing them? The seeds need cold stratification, not something that's super common in it's native Syrian range.

An uncontrolled¬†nuclear fission¬†began immediately. The resulting nuclear fission chain became¬†self-sustaining, emitting intense¬†gamma¬†and¬†neutron radiation.[1]¬†At the time of the event, Ouchi had his body draped over the tank while Shinohara stood on a platform to assist in pouring the solution. Yokokawa was sitting at a desk four meters away.[13]¬†All three technicians observed a¬†blue flash¬†(possibly¬†Cherenkov radiation) and gamma radiation alarms sounded.[16]¬†Over the next several hours the fission reaction produced continuous chain reactions.
Ouchi and Shinohara immediately experienced pain, nausea, and difficulty breathing. Ouchi received the largest radiation exposure, resulting in rapid difficulties with mobility, coherence, and loss of consciousness.[13]


Hisashi Ouchi, 35, was transported and treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital for 83 days.[21]¬†Ouchi suffered serious radiation burns to most of his body, experienced severe damage to his internal organs, and had a near-zero¬†white blood cell¬†count. Without a functioning immune system, Ouchi was vulnerable to¬†hospital-borne pathogens¬†and was placed in a special radiation ward to limit the risk of contracting an infection.[22]¬†Doctors attempted to restore some functionality to Ouchi's immune system by administering¬†peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, which at the time was a new form of treatment.[10]¬†After receiving the transplant from his sister, Ouchi initially experienced increased white blood cell counts temporarily but succumbed to his other injuries shortly thereafter.[21]¬†The leukocytes being produced by the transplanted tissue were found to have been mutated by the residual radiation present in his body, triggering¬†autoimmune responses¬†that exacerbated his rapidly deteriorating condition, and white blood cell counts began to decrease.[10]¬†Numerous other interventions were conducted in an attempt to arrest further decline of Ouchi's severely damaged body, including repeated use of cultured skin grafts and pharmacological interventions with¬†painkillers,¬†broad-spectrum antibiotics¬†and¬†granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, without any measurable success.[23]

At the wishes of his family, doctors repeatedly revived Ouchi when his heart stopped, even as it became clear the damage his body had sustained through radiation was untreatable. Despite their efforts, his condition deteriorated into¬†multiple organ failure¬†resulting from extensive radiation damage, exacerbated by the repeated incidents where Ouchi's heart stopped. He died on 21 December 1999 following an unrecoverable cardiac arrest.[24]",1647698738.0,460

2216,AskReddit,What is a useless fact that you know?,,1647673361.0,2406,2905,0.96,707Cutthoatcommitee,"Just for some better clarification here. a black panther only refers to specifically a leopard or Jaguar that is melanistic (opposite of albino). They are not a separate species of cat nor is a panther. Panther is an umbrella term for three big cats in specific. 

A panther in general can refer to a leopard if it‚Äôs in the old world and if it‚Äôs in The United States it‚Äôs generally referring to Pumas and when in Latin America it‚Äôs usually referring to Jaguars. So basically a panther can be a puma, leopard or a Jaguar but a black panther can only be a Jaguar or leopard since melanistic pumas aren‚Äôt a documented thing. 

Almost done here but a Puma, Cougar and mountain lion are the same species of big cat just different names and the only one currently native to the United States. Jaguars have a current range as far north as south central Mexico and have a historical range that goes all the way north to Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico extending all the way east to the Louisiana/Texas border. So yes historically there were actual Jaguars roaming around  the deep southwest United States as well. Something wild though is there has been multiple sightings of a lone male? (Could be a female) Jaguar that is actually living in the mountains of Arizona. He has been recorded and is being kinda sorta tracked by fish and game the best they can and was seen as recently as 2019 I believe. They think he came from one of the populations from central Mexico and migrated really far north and decided to stay. After all it‚Äôs technically historical range for them so it makes sense that he can thrive there as well as in California or New Mexico.",1647707068.0,11

In the 90s I worked for Dominos and we had this garlic sauce called ‚ÄúZzesty‚Äù sauce that we had to apply to the pan pizzas that us lowlife teens called splooge. 

Well, my assistant manager Stacy liked to be cool like us kids so she started calling it that as well but she didn‚Äôt know what the slang word was actually for. 

Then one day our supervisor Brenda, who was just the right mix of hip enough to know what splooge meant but overly religious enough to be taken aback by its mention was there and Stacy asked me for some splooge. 

The horrified look on Brenda‚Äôs face, combined with the confused look on Stacy‚Äôs face at why Brenda was horrified  was the funniest thing I‚Äôd ever seen and thankfully I was able to stifle the explosion of laughter until I made my way back into the walk-in to get the splooge.",1647691590.0,111

I used to employ a young manager gal who had a raunchy sense of humor behind the professional facade for the customers.  At some point, *Man Chowder* became a member of our running gag repertoire.  That ended abruptly when she was ordering lunch one day, and instead of clam chowder actually ordered *man* chowder, then instantly looked mortified.  Both her and the person on the other end just played it off, but unlike the typical slow death of overwrought workplace jokes, nobody there ever uttered *man chowder* again after that.",1647678549.0,26

3463,AskReddit,What are the best nicknames you've heard of for semen?,,1647658949.0,2468,4033,0.89,ArmyOfDog,"Eddie Vedder said that the name Pearl Jam was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.

Nobody believes that. And the band eventually admitted that other then Eddie having a great-grandmother named Pearl, the rest was made up. 

Many people believe it means jizz. The band has never confirmed this explanation, instead offering questionable alternative explanations. 

One of them is that bassist Jeff Ament suggested Pearl, and then with them being big fans of Neil Young who‚Äôd recently played a show where every song was a 20 minute jam, they combined jam with Pearl, resulting in Pearl Jam. 

Originally, they were called Mookie Blaylock, naming themselves after a basketball player they liked. Ultimately, they named their debut album after him instead, as Mookie Blaylock‚Äôs number was ten.",1647662150.0,62

Sometimes bands with suggestive names seem to get by without having to explain their names away (AC/DC, The Butthole Surfers, Steely Dan, Bush, Flaming Lips, Whitesnake, Pussy Riot, Hole, *etc*.) Some other bands with daring names seem to back away from them when record companies balk. 

It has long been assumed that this meaning was also the meaning for [10cc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10cc#1972%E2%80%931976:_Original_line-up) and (arguably, and perhaps by way of Mississippi John Hurt) the same meaning for [The Lovin' Spoonful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovin'_Spoonful#Name).

It was this evil/trickster spirit that was basically half an (old?) man split down the middle. If he turned his cut side towards you he was invisible and he could leap great distances on his one leg. He would challenge young lone men to a fight, I think with promises of wealth if he could be beaten. Looking weak, many young men would be lured in only to be overpowered by the creature's monstrous strength. I think the creature possibly ate those they defeated.

EDIT: Having had a bit more of a dig into it I think it's part of a theme of one-armed, one-legged creatures in various African folklores. ""Hai-uri"" to the Khoekhoe, ""Chiruwi"" to some central African group (that's all it says online, no idea which peoples that would be) or ""Tikdoshe"" to the amaZulu. 

Not a lot of info out there of what a Tikdoshe does but references to the Chiruwi say it challenges those it meets to a deadly fight but if beaten will beg for its life and teach the person magic/medicine so that they can become a medicine man.",1647682361.0,28

It‚Äôs interesting, because while it‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúnature spirit‚Äù, it‚Äôs not benevolent, or at worst, mischievous, like nature spirits in mythology tend to be (putting aside the unseelie court, of course). It represents the dark aspects of nature: hunger, cold, predation, savagery.

It‚Äôs also interesting to me, because the story actually seems like it could be about prion diseases. The Wendigo spirit possesses people who eat the flesh of other people and it slowly drives them insane and turns them into vicious beasts. Sounds a lot like what Creutzfeldt-Jakob does, how it slowly destroys your brain leading to psychosis and rapid mental decline before death. It, of course, also spreads through eating the flesh (primarily brain and spinal fluid) of infected people. So to my mind, the Wendigo story was a way for them to explain people being infected with a prion disease, and as a warning to not eat human flesh so as not to become infected as well.",1647665859.0,1166

Wasn‚Äôt terrible, but the Wendigo is my favorite mythological creature, there really aren‚Äôt enough movies about the Wendigo out there, and I really, really wanted this one to be amazing.

They're literally just saying ""yeah, you're not that pretty but you're nice and that's what counts!"". It's true in a way, you're a good person and honestly that's better than being the most beautiful person in the world but have an ugly heart.  But you have to admit that society has a strangle hold on the idea of beauty and no matter how good you are sometimes you'll run into problems because you aren't conventionally attractive. At most people don't really care whether you're a good person or not, especially when it comes to modelling or other similar fields where you have to fit the conventional standard; hell, even dating. This goes all ways for both men, women and everything in between.

It just sucks because everyone is beautiful in a way, but you can't change a system on society that literally everyone sees on magazines and billboards and go ""yes, that is beauty,"" and runs with it. Yes, were taking steps to slowly overcome this, but honestly it should have been overcome years ago.",1647699225.0,51

What happened? She grew up, and realized how fucked up the world is. And how bad people can be. And that you can't always be nice, and go along with things. Cause that's how you get hurt. That's how you get manipulated. That's how you get used. You need to stand up for yourself. And not always go along with everything, and act like everything is okay.  

Sorry for the little rant there. But I used to be one of the sweetest people. Until I grew up. And realized I was being manipulated by my own dad, and his gf. I remembered going home to my own mom. And just crying. Crying and telling her all of the things that happened at my dad's. Things that made me uncomfortable and scared. Things that I didn't know were not okay until I was much older. I was always terrified of going to my dad's. And I always begged my mom to stay with her. But I had to go....

I eventually got therapy, and I'm doing so much better now. Im not as easy going anymore. And I actually stand up for myself. And say something when I'm not okay. Or if something makes me uncomfortable. I'm a lot older now. I'm old enough to decide how I want my relationships to go. And I don't go over to my dad's very often anymore. Because it's just too much.

I had to uproot my life and move to a state that was more affordable and had a better cost-of-living, because where my family was from, was impossible for someone like me without a degree to get a job and afford living outside of the house as a mid 20 something year old. Now the prices are increasing around here. How is this the American dream? I shouldn‚Äôt have to move 500+ miles away to afford life. I am working towards finishing my degree, I have a better job than some people who did graduate when I was supposed to, but student loans are killing me.

‚ÄúYou should of not gotten student loans for college‚Äù. Well I didn‚Äôt really have a choice with a single mother, who pushed me to go for a bachelors degree and said she‚Äôd help pay off my loans (she did NOT give me a dime and co-signed some shitty loans). I DID choose at the age of 22, to find my own voice, and to not continue bleeding money I didn‚Äôt have that my mom kept trying to push on me, to complete my senior year. I have refinanced and consolidated my student loans to a much better rate and can actually afford to pay them on time (I never missed a payment to begin with). I am looking for a company that will pay for the last five courses I need, as I have been doing part-time online college with no Fed grants since I ‚Äúmake too much‚Äù even with my debt to income ratio. 

‚ÄúStop renting and buy a house if renting is too expensive‚Äù. 
Well I fucking did that too. I saved after living in a low cost area for a year to buy my first home. That doesn‚Äôt mean utilities don‚Äôt keep increasing to match with inflation. That doesn‚Äôt mean this house doesn‚Äôt need work because I can‚Äôt afford a turn key home, and I‚Äôll being doing updates for years that‚Äôll come out of my own pocket. 

‚ÄúWell get a better job!‚Äù
I have. I make substantially more than I did 2 years ago. I‚Äôm working on getting a new job were I can make even more to be able to start investing / saving more. I work hard at my career and am not lazy at work, working tirelessly to exceed standard so that I‚Äôm a valued employee who can they can dump more work on me. If I didn‚Äôt have student loans, how much I make now would be such a comfortable life.


Realistically I might not be financially comfortable enough to have a family. Did I do this to myself? Maybe at some point; but what I was fed as a child did not realistically measure up to reality. How can you blame a child who followed the ‚Äúrules‚Äù to have a good future, for it to be not the case? So I decided to take control over my own life at 22 and am far better off than what I would have been, if I had continued to follow what my Baby Boomer mother wanted. She still tries to make me feel ashamed for not having a degree yet, but this isn‚Äôt her life. 

I‚Äôd appreciate a bit more sympathy from the age group that DID have more economic advantages than we currently do. I‚Äôm not blaming them for the economy we are in now, but understand how hard it would be to be experiencing early adulthood now. This is the economy their kids / grandkids are dealing with; how does this foreshadow for the nation / world‚Äôs future? This isn‚Äôt sustainable for a society, so we should start caring now.

Recently the average price point in America just reached point where we‚Äôd be if the trend stuck to the 4% historic appreciation rate, had we not experienced the crash in ‚Äò08. So yes, values are raising quickly, AND they would have been this high either way if we didn‚Äôt crash in ‚Äò08

Yes, homes are going in in value, that‚Äôs what they do!

**Other facts you might like:**

- in 2009, 54% of mortgages were higher than the value of the home, and right now less than .04% are like that
- American homes have never seen so much equity in them resulting in more stable household incomes (even if those incomes deserve to be higher)
- more homes are selling then ever before, and 5-6 years ago there were on average about 1.5million homes available nationally at any given time. Right now there are about 300k homes available on the market, and with a shrinking average days on market it results in a lower available supply which in turn drives up costs
- there are now more real estate agents then ever before and 600k left the business between 2008-2009
- fewer people are selling their homes on their own then ever before regardless of the many resources available to help the homeowner do so

Or some dude needs to commit some spec ops work where they approach you without getting shot by other 30 players and C4/mine you. So while these people are wasting time trying to deal with you, singular player; you get to rack up on kills all that time. Honestly, it's not a rewarding experience.

They are dumb for not checking because these ‚Äúcheese strats‚Äù win battles.

There is a reason they tell you to check your corners to clear a room. The same principle applies to a street in war.

If a soldier killed all those men this way in real war, they wouldn‚Äôt dishonourably discharge him with a cheese wheel placed on his head, he would be a hero and you would still be jealous of him for being smarter than you and thinking outside the box.

The lack of intentional fragmentation gave it a shorter kill radius which meant that doctrine for the grenade's usage was to throw them and then assault to position after they detonate (sorta like a more lethal version of a flash bang) as it's more likely the enemy will be stunned than with fragmentation grenades. They used a substantial amount of explosive material in them which gave them more destructive power than a fragmentation grenade but generally a smaller kill radius due to how the force dispurses as it covers more volume. These grenades could also be bundled together to combine their blast enough to damage armored vehicles or defensive structures.

The MK2 grenade by contrast was designed to fragment and shower the area with bits of metal to kill/injure the enemy. The concussive blast was still quite lethal but the fragmentation was the primary casualty inflicting element of the grenade (close enough for the concussive blast to kill then you are also probably full of shrapnel).

The DLC's are entertaining, the wing-suit is the fastest, great rockets...

There's a big BUT, the missions are boring and long. But you don't play a Just Cause for the story, so it's a great game.

I hope that the fifth of the series try to get the ""dark story"" of the third, get the hooks of the fourth and have better missions, explosions etc.",1647704949.0,1

IMHO, jc2 was the best in the series. 3 and 4 are good but something in 2 just made it feel good. I wanna believe it was partly the physics. 2 felt  a little cartoonish in physics but in 3 and 4 it feels like they went a more real direction. And it doesn't translate as well in an over the top game like just cause. Might be just me but the controls feel heavily laggy in 4. Like if you attach too many grapple hook points, one is bound to sling you forward even though you are just trying to stick a couple rockets to something. And tanks handle incredibly poorly. Can't run over even small barricades without it either getting stuck inside the tank or stopping the tank.

I do love how they made it feel more like it was a mercenaries game spinoff but the 4th one though. The missions did feel a bit bland but the world and destruction were fun. Overall, $100ish well spent (gold launch edition plus the story dlc)",1647709670.0,1

So the map is littered with the mini events like ""wingsuit challenge"" and ""car stunt"" stuff. Which is alright.

But there's no military bases to blow up. No other random collectibles (whether you love em or hate em). There's technically stuff to destroy, and kind of a point to it. But it's much much less organized than the previous games.

And that's what I liked about JC2 and 3. You had a more clear idea about where to go and what to do. You're meant to go to those bases and blow things up there until it's ""complete"".

In JC4 there's just a few things here and there to destroy in places where main missions occur. But it's not really tracked - and in fact anything you destroy will just respawn next time you load in.

So like I said, the only thing to actually ""do"" is just main missions, or driving a different car through a ring. Gets old really fuckin fast",1647707242.0,11

Some sections require you to do a ""mission"" where you do basic stuff at a major military base in order to send in rebels to free the area to your control. Then some areas have the start of the main goal missions which is to take down some weather control machine. They are interesting but there isn't many. Like one mission is to shut down antennas that control lightning that can just about kill you if you aren't quick enough.

You have a dungeon master (DM) who guides the experience. They set up dungeons, monsters, and plot and are basically a combination of a narrator, a guide for the players, and play as the NPCs and villains. Their goal isn't really to win or to lose, it's simply to give the other players a good time, so think of them more like an author than a game player.

Each person chooses their own character and decides their looks, personality, backstory, everything. They also have a list of basic abilities called skills where they have a certain number of points in each skill, like climbing.

Narrative play in D&D is generally telling the DM what you want to do, then the DM figures out what skill best suits that action, comes up with a number that you need to pass it, and then you roll the die and add the die to your points in that ability to see if you pass or fail. Combining the ability points with the die roll gives the best of both worlds - not random but not known, so someone experienced in a skill can still fail it but is less likely to.

Once the player has the results then the DM narrates what that pass or fail actually means. If they pass maybe they simply managed to climb the wall they were trying to, or maybe they climbed the wall so well that they got to the top twice as fast as everyone else. If they failed maybe they simply couldn't even get started, or maybe they climbed three quarters up, got distracted by a bird, and then fell so far that they broke their legs. It's all up to the DM to weave the player's results into a story.

Fighting in D&D is similar but more complicated. It's been a while since I played so I won't get into the details but you still combine die rolls with skills to figure out how much damage you do and take, but it is much more spelled out than the narrative play and works more like video games do, where players and enemies have HP.

Also, beyond simple skills there are feats and spells which are special abilities detailed in the guidebook. These can get pretty complex and are part of what gives D&D its reputation for being a game for nerds. For example, there is the spell Tensor's Floating Disk, whose first half of the description reads: ""This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.""",1647711252.0,3

When you give item you bought that item with your own money but if you had just given the money they could have use it to bulk buy and buy the same thing but more

If you give an item you most likely will give the obvious item and if everybody does that a charity can end up with to much of the obvious item (potentially having to throw away some) and not enough of the less obvious item 

Money is also easier to transport allowing the charity to buy stuff near where they are need. That has the double benefit or stimulating local economy which is a good thing when you are trying to help zone in crisis

I know that giving stuff you bought feels better because it feels like you gave money and effort but the best thing you can do is give just money. Its literally the best of both world, you can be lazy and do more good than if you had made an effort",1647704998.0,36

That‚Äôs why bed time is her favorite, because she can cuddle up real close to me for warmth (and I‚Äôm a huge fan, her purring puts me right to sleep).  If her face can‚Äôt touch my face, then she needs to have at least one paw touching me.  She‚Äôs definitely the best work colleague I‚Äôve had in a long time.

My little man is the opposite.  He‚Äôs a really good boy, but he gets affection in his own time.  He wants you to acknowledge him and let him know you love him, and then he wants to fall asleep on your clean clothes or on the clean towels in the linen closet until it‚Äôs time to eat.  But if something is wrong, he‚Äôs the first to come running to make you hold him so he can lick your face with his sandpaper tongue.

If you look at the movie it is even a giant leap forward in the show. The sexism and racism are still rampant but there are moments where you can see them TRYING to do better. The episode where the guy was worried about getting ""the wrong color blood"", the gay soldier who was bashed in his unit and was trying to stay in the service without dying because of his sexuality, hell women as Majors and Generals was huge.  We can look back and judge with our new understanding of equality but I am not sure it helps. For me, I look at it as a metric for just how far we have come in my lifetime.

The book had a character named Spearchucker and the show ended up heavily deviating from the source material. The author actually did not like the show due to its anti war message.

i‚Äôm not sure what happened, or how i got here,

n never before was a *human* so near‚Ä¶

i thought they were scary, n i‚Äôd run away,

the only words spoken were Mean - *‚ÄôLousy STRAY!*‚Äô

sometimes in their windows a Cat i would spy,

all Fancy n Floofy - much better than i 

i dreamt of a world where someday i would be

where someone would shelter n take care of me  

n then in a moment a terrible fight!

such clawing n screaming - the end was in sight‚Ä¶

but then a voice, gentle - ‚Äò‚Ä¶*Aww, what‚Äôs this I see?!*‚Äô

‚Äò*Hang on there, sweet kitten - you‚Äôre coming with Me..*‚Äô

n now that you found me, this Love that i feel

it makes my heart melt,

but I‚Äôm starting to heal

you make life  worth living in all that you do

Thank you, good human -

my Cat dream‚Äôs

come True!

>The fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small crepuscular fox native to the Sahara Desert, the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which serve to dissipate heat. The fennec is the smallest canid species. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to the desert environment with high temperatures and little water. Also, its hearing is sensitive to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds. The fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild.",1647680691.0,33

> Why can't people leave animals in their natural habitat?


Might be a rescue or anything like that. It's not because it's their natural habitat that it is safe for them or they are more happy. If I let my dog alone in the nature, trust me he'll die in 2 hours. Not because he can't hunt and chase (he's pretty good at it), because he will feel lonely. Some animals are made to be in pack and If the pack reject them, they just dying slowly with absolutely no will to live anymore. 



The real question you should be worrying about is ""does it have enough space and liberty?"". That would be an amazing question. People often adopt animals because they love them but doesn't give enough space, attention, time and more. Which is sad. If all the criteria are respected, I'm just happy that any pet is safe and living the best life.",1647693149.0,-10

Then you [don't know much about fennec foxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/aie643/giving_a_fennec_fox_a_bath/eenvdoc).

It's not miserable because it's in captivity, it's miserable because they are a desert species and hate water, and you can tell by its body language.

Asking god for strength not to kill himself by the end of the day.

Something about the beat and melancholy pushed me to find it. I later translated it via DeepL because im Danish, the lyrics are amazing. So is the song. 

No one needs war


At ease until the dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us, echoing loudly


No one wants war


Let's burn till dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us with a loud echo


There's no prettier color


The color


Of light without war


The color of summer


The clouds have taken the planet


On guard, my heavens


Boy-boy-boy


Painted with color on the banner


In stripes as red as blood


Yellow as the sun above us


My green Zion


My Rastafari


No one wants war


At ease till the dawn




War in ashes of order


Sing to us, with a loud echo of it


No one wants war


Let's burn till dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us with a loud echo


Oh, we should have been smart sooner


Many brothers would have survived


If only the stars hadn't carried us through the night


‚ô™ From the rocking in the night, in the beginning ‚ô™


‚ô™ We'll make a record ‚ô™


‚ô™ So that we can be happy ‚ô™


‚ô™ On a familiar path ‚ô™


‚ô™ From bad weather ‚ô™


‚ô™ I'm in time for the steam train ‚ô™


 Here's a hello to you


Take me secretly


Away from the war.


No one needs war


We'll be free before the dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us, echoing loudly


No one needs war


Let's burn till dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us with a loud echo",1647634414.0,15

> In 2018, Prusikin quoted the famous aphorism: ""The [Russian] state has murdered my Motherland"" and criticised the Russian populace's easygoing attitude towards life and, especially, local indifference towards corruption. In a 2019 interview with Xenia Sobchak, Prusikin spoke of his total dislike of modern Russian politics, emphasising the increased ""cult of intolerance and anger"" in internal politics after 2012. He publicly supported Ivan Golunov during the journalist's persecution.

During the first couple days of the invasion I started looking to Ukraine, it‚Äôs history, and modern culture since I realized that while I felt horrible and disgusted by what was happening, I knew next to nothing of their history. 

Found a guy called Yarmak (at least that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs translated to in everything I‚Äôve seen) who had some sick beats going, and a great sounding flow. Started listening to his stuff with a translation pulled up beside, and some of it is extremely powerful, and related in ways to current events.

For example his song ‚Äú22‚Äù is about the events there in 2014, and contains a section that goes (translated to English): 

‚ÄúIt shouldn't be like this, guys.
I'm bandaging my country
with white gauze.
There are the ones,
whose souls are not empty yet around me.
Those, who are ready to sacrifice
their bodies for the truth.
She was lying torn, like a ruin.
People around were whispering her name -
Ukraine.
 
Refrain:
My country will never kneel.
And our cities will make a stand
like mountains, believe me.
There's no one who'll prevent us
from getting drunk of freedom.
While in each of us
the soul of a Ukrainian is living.‚Äù

Seriously I highly recommend looking him up (or if you check my post history I posted one of his videos recently) because it‚Äôs some really good stuff. Even before you translate I promise you‚Äôll be bobbing your head to some of his beats.",1647616767.0,10

When he was a teenager, Mascis had met the band somehow and at one point he was hired to house sit for Thurston and Kim. J brought just a bag of tuna fish cans for a week and never left the apartment because he found New York to be scary. Kim and Thurston came back to find a bunch of old tuna cans under their bed. This is such a J Mascis story.

Second story: J Mascis is from Amherst, MA and he actually still lives there. Amherst is a rural college town with a surprisingly deep indie rock scene. Pixies also met and started in Amherst while attending UMass Amherst. Anyway, Kim and Thurston were introduced to Western Mass by J. They liked the area so much that they bought a house in neighboring Northampton, MA. Kim and Thurston lived there for years and Sonic Youth used to play local all-ages shows for a few bucks in the area. I know this because I went to many of them as I'm originally from the area. The cover to ""Washing Machine"" was taken at one of these shows in Amherst.",1647707399.0,1

If you feel like taking a litte feedback, there's just one thing that could be done better: matching the perspectives of the car and ground. In short, if you would put the car on the ground and take a photo from the same angle & height, the ground would extend further towards the horizon than the platform you are using in the studio. This means that in your final photo, the ground ends ""too early"" leaving an artificial look. You could fix that by either lowering the camera (imagine taking a photo from ground plane, then the horizon is barely visible), extending the platform longer behind the car or simply use some PS magic to do it.

Hope this make sense :)

Anyway, awesome job!",1647710447.0,1

My wife (who's European) and I took a trip there since my parents were about to sell the old house.  She'd, of course, heard the jokes, but never seen it firsthand.

On our way from the airport to the house, we stopped at a 7/11 along the side of a small highway to get some beer and wine.  As soon as we parked, a van pulled up next to us in the parking lot.  A very skinny man in an oversized shirt and overweight woman with midriff showing came out.  I'm not body shaming, just painting the picture.  I went in the store, she stayed in the car.

When I came out, five minutes later, the couple had already set up lawn chairs in the parking lot, she was huffing a cig while reading a magazine, and he a beer.  They did not, nor did they have any intention of, going in the store.

Now, mind you, the beach, along with dirt parking, was *just across the street.*  Not even a main beach, one where you'd be the only one for miles.  But this couple had decided to set up camp in *the 7/11 parking lot* instead.  This was 30 minutes into our trip.

I turned to her and said, with no judgement or irony: ""welcome to Florida.""",1647677622.0,1005

I've learned that there are no basic regulations or enforcement on rules that we would consider basic for-safety laws anywhere else.   

No bumper or missing windows on your car?  no problem, we don't do inspections down here.   

Leave garbage and building materials thrown across your yard for months?  no problem, we don't like restrictive HOA's down here.   

Drive around town, in circles, for hours, with vision-restricting massive flags in tow, spouting your political views for all the folks enjoying their dinners to see.  Sure, that fits the do whatever your want vibe.

Industrial sewage spills and dangerous phosphate leaks into the waterways....multiple times.  Yes, no regulations on safety maintenance needed!  But we will fix it up after a problem happens.

The police presence is usually very visible, but after years of driving here, I have yet to see anyone pulled over for a traffic violation other than speeding.  Turn signals, stopping at red lights, following posted signs are all optional as part of the do whatever you want state.",1647696935.0,12

He named media proprietor Oprah Winfrey as his ideal running mate and said he would instantly marry his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, to make her First Lady.

Example: ""well Hillary supporters cried about election fraud and claimed she really won, too!""  

a) not as many of them did as when Trump lost,  

b) it didn't last as long as when Trump lost,  

c) Hillary still won the popular vote even when she lost, so at least it was a little more reasonable to claim, meanwhile Trump lost to Biden by 7 million votes meaning he would need to discover a monumental amount of fraud to even have a fart in the wind's chance to overturn the election,   

d) Hillary actually *conceded,* and Trump blatantly lied to the American people, there's proof of it, yet people *still* want him president,  

e) People *stormed the Capitol* when Trump lost.  

f) There were Trump supporters in 2016 crying about election fraud *even when he won,* because they thought he should have beat Hillary by a wider margin.  

They're idiots. Elightened centrist: ""oh no, you can't call them that!! It'll radicalize them and then it'll be all your fault!"" Quit your gaslighting.

It's a step up for the generation it was built for.  That second story & garage represents the advantages of simply being white Al Bundy in America after WW2:  lots of resources, high demand, reduced competition and sophisticated infrastructure & education systems which are able to grow with demand... thanks to collecting and spending taxes.    This further fuels a hungry economy, widening it's effects among the public & increasing incomes - making a bigger down payment and a bigger mortgage payment for a bigger house possible for millions more people.   Al Bundy has no skills.  Just like the owners of the shoe companies, Al didn't build the road, grow the wilderness,  develop Conservation techniques in a State College, or get a GI bill loan.

They're our family, friends and coworkers, people we'd never guess, and people we suspect immediately. It's a good thing to pry sometimes if you care.

 As I get older I'm realizing the family, while obviously positive in many ways, can also be one of the most pernicious structures we have. No organizations hide and cover up abuse more than families do, no one is more likely to abuse you than a family member. No structure is so quick to turn away outside eyes, or be so righteously indignant over suspicions, warranted or not. I come from an abusive household, my childhood involved watching my mother being beaten, in between my own beatings, and no one ever stopped it. 

We are in a weird place where most people seem to consider the family a unit separate from society, with their own rules and punishments, unregulated  by the general population, and immune from any curtailing without involving ineffectual bureaucracy. Add to this laws changing to give family more authority, and it seems to me a broader, more malignant plan for societal domination, where an authoritarian man is tasked with keeping his Cadre in line and in submission to authority. I think the nuclear family is a detriment to humanity, maybe that belongs in r/unpopularopinion, but I stand by it.",1647712333.0,1

The weirdest was another pro bono case, where it came to light the ‚Äúabuser‚Äù was the victim. They didn‚Äôt ever harm the victim and instead had spent years under emotional and physical abuse.

>I have friends who are a married lesbian couple and they choose to use the terms husband/wife.

Fantastic. Neither is a male, therefore ""husband"" is inappropriate. 

>Edit: I wish I knew why I was downvoted‚Ä¶

So first your friends are trying to conflate a word to have another meaning that doesn't mean what they want it to be based on some ill-perceived inclusion. *Technically,* they're both wives. The downvotes are most like from people like me who think that you can't just make up different definitions of words just to align with your own incorrect world view; and, ultimately, just because they use that word (while it is their choice) doesn't make it correct - it just makes them sound stupid.

Edit: *And,* based on this context, the dude above you is 100% in the right to assume that (since they used ""husband"" specifically), the person in question is male.",1647710996.0,1
7982,pics,[OC] This is the face of domestic abuse. This is my face.,,1647678483.0,212,2495,0.89,Organic__Chemistry,"Let's take a look at just raw numbers. The entire United States military (including clerks, nurses, generals, cooks, etc) is 1.2 million. Law enforcement is estimated at about 1.1 million (again, including clerks and other non-officers.) This gives us a combined force of 2.3 million people who could potentially be tapped to deal with a civil insurrection. Keep in mind this also includes officers who serve in the prisons, schools, and other public safety positions that require their presence. That total of soldiers is also including US soldiers deployed to the dozens of overseas US bases in places like South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc. Many of those forces are considered vital and can't be removed due to strategic concerns.

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the state slaps a rifle in every filing clerk's hand and tells them to sort the situation out.

We now have to contend with the fact that many law enforcement and military personnel consider themselves patriots and wouldn't necessarily just automatically side with the state if something were to happen. There is a very broad swath of people involved in these communities that have crossover with militia groups and other bodies that are, at best, not 100% in support of the government. Exact numbers are hard to pin down but suffice it to say that not everybody would be willing to snap-to if an insurrection kicked off. Even if they didn't outright switch sides there's the very real possibility that they could, in direct or indirect ways, work against their employer's prosecution of the counter-insurgency either by directly sabotaging operations or just not putting as much effort into their work and turning a blind eye to things.

But, again, for the sake of argument, let's assume that you've somehow managed to talk every single member of the military and law enforcement services into being 100% committed to rooting out the rebel scum.

There are an estimated 400 million firearms in the US. Even if we just ignore 300 million firearms available as maybe they're antiques or not in a condition to be used, that's still 100 million firearms that citizens can pick up and use. Let's go even further than that and say of that 100, there are only about 20 million firearms that are both desirable and useful in an insurgency context and not say .22's or double barrelled shotguns.

It should be noted just for the sake of interest that several million AR-15's are manufactured every year and have been since 2004 when the ""assault weapons"" ban ended. Soooo 2-5 million per year for 15 years....

If only 2% of the US population decided ""Fuck it, let's dance!"" and rose up, that's about 6.5 million people. You're already outnumbering all law enforcement and the military almost 3 to 1. And you have enough weapons to arm them almost four times over. There are millions of tons of ammunition held in private hands and the materials to make ammunition are readily available online even before you start talking about reloading through scrounging.

So you have a well equipped armed force that outnumbers the standing military and law enforcement capabilities of the country by a significant margin.

""But the military has tanks, planes, and satellites!""

That they do however it's worth noting that the majority of the capabilities of our armed forces are centered around engaging another state in a war. That means another entity that also has tanks, planes, and satellites. That is where the majority of our warfighting capabilities are centered because that's what conflict has consisted of for most of the 20th century.

We've learned a lot about asymmetric warfare since our time in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of the key takeaways has been just having tanks and battleships is not enough to win against even a much smaller and more poorly armed opponent.

A battleship or a bomber is great if you're going after targets that you don't particularly care about but they don't do you a whole hell of a lot of good when your targets are in an urban setting mixed in with people that you, the commander, are accountable to.

Flattening a city block is fine in Overthereastan because you can shrug and call the sixty civilians you killed ""collateral damage"" and no one gives a shit. If you do that here, you seriously damage perceptions about you among the civilians who then are going to get upset with you. Maybe they manage to bring enough political pressure on you to get you ousted, maybe they start helping the rebels, or maybe they pick up guns of their own and join in. You killed fifteen fighters in that strike but in so doing you may have created thirty more.

Even drones are of mixed utility in that circumstance. It's also worth noting that the US is several orders of magnitude larger than the areas that drones have typically operated in during conflict in the Middle East. And lest we forget, these drones are not exactly immune from attacks. There's also not a lot a drone can do in places with large amounts of tree cover...like over a billion acres of the US.

And then even if we decide that it's worth employing things like Hellfire missiles and cluster bombs, it should be noted that a strategy of ""bomb the shit out of them"" didn't work in over a decade in the Middle East. Most of the insurgent networks in the region that were there when the war started are still there and still operating, even if their influence is diminished they are still able to strike targets.

Just being able to bomb the shit out of someone doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to win in a conflict against them.

Information warfare capabilities also don't guarantee success. There are always workarounds and methods that are resistant to interception and don't require a high level of technical sophistication. Many commercial solutions can readily be used or modified to put a communications infrastructure in place that is beyond the reach of law enforcement or the military to have reliable access to. Again, there are dozens of non-state armed groups that are proving this on a daily basis.

You also have to keep in mind the psychological factor. Most soldiers are ok with operating in foreign countries where they can justify being aggressive towards the local population; they're over here, my people are back home. It's a lot harder to digest rolling down the streets of cities in your own country and pointing guns at people you may even know.

What do you do as a police officer or soldier when you read that soldiers opened fire into a crowd of people in your home town and killed 15? What do you do when you've been ordered to break down the door of a neighbor that you've known your whole life and arrest them or search their home? What do you do if you find out a member of your own family has been working with the insurgency and you have a professional responsibility to turn them in even knowing they face, at best, a long prison sentence and at worst potential execution? What do you do when your friends, family, and community start shunning you as a symbol of a system that they're starting to see more and more as oppressive and unjust?

""People couldn't organize on that scale!""

This is generally true. Even with the networked communications technologies that we have it's likely ideological and methodological differences would prevent a mass army of a million or more from acting in concert.

In many ways, that's part of what would make an insurrection difficult to deal with. Atomized groups of people, some as small as five or six, would be a nightmare to deal with because you have to take each group of fighters on its own. A large network can be brought down by attacking its control nodes, communication channels, and key figures.

Hundreds of small groups made up of five to twenty people all acting on their own initiative with different goals, values, and methods of operation is a completely different scenario and a logistical nightmare. It's a game of whack-a-mole with ten thousand holes and one hammer. Lack of coordination means even if you manage to destroy, infiltrate, or otherwise compromise one group you have at best removed a dozen fighters from the map. Attacks would be random and spontaneous, giving you little to no warning and no ability to effectively preempt an attack.

Negotiation isn't really an option either. Deals you cut with one group won't necessarily be honored by another and while you can leverage and create rivalries between the groups to a certain extent you can only do this by acknowledging some level of control and legitimacy that they possess. You have to give them some kind of legitimacy if you want to talk to them, the very act of talking says ""You are worth talking to."" And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of these groups.

You are, in effect, trying to herd cats who not only have no interest in listening to you but are actively dedicated to frustrating your efforts and who greatly outnumber you in an environment that prevents the use of the tools that your resources are optimized to employ.

Would it be bad? Definitely. Casualties would be extremely high on all sides. That's not a scenario I would ever want to see play out. It would be a long, drawn out war of attrition that the actual US government couldn't effectively win.

Well you are right... How many invasions/takeovers has Putin led of former USSR nations? 

This is certainly the most ambitious

And I can tell you with confidence:

1) if we don't intervene Russia will continue. Itl probably take a few years to quell the insurrections and begin assimilating Ukrainian military assets, but they will continue.

2) China is watching... This will inform their decision for how to take over Taiwan. Either:
A) continue propaganda efforts/getting favorable politicians in to slowly attempt a peaceful takeover
B) rapid invasion if they think they can stomach the sanctions and that the U.S. wont intervene

Russia cannot go to war against a united Europe, they cannot even go to war with many of the individual nations in Europe.  But they know they don't have to, just cause enough destabilization that the West can't respond with a concerted effort.  If they hold out long enough, they strategize that support for Ukraine will wane, the worse economic situation will cause political change in the US, and the resultant crisises, especially if Russian petroleum products stop going into Europe, will cause so much chaos that Russia can occupy Ukraine with minimal resistance and expand into Moldova, Georgia and other countries.  If Poland descends into chaos from the refugees, if Russia cuts off or is cut off from oil sales in Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, etc, they may be able to strike a decesive blow against NATO without firing a shot.

I hate this debate because it gets so out of control and spiraling with ideological fanaticism way too fast, but long story short, after Fukushima, Germany did a reevaluation of most of its nuclear plants and found glaring security holes in a lot of them, with others being soon to deteriorate. As a result, and in accordance with public opinion at the time, Germany decided to not reinvest money to fix those power plants and instead decided to deprecate its nuclear energy generation when their security certificates run out.

Germany did not ramp up its gas energy production as a result. It delayed its exit from coal, and at the time funded the SolarWorld-Bubble, but gas has always been very benign to pure power generation. Gas in Germany is mainly used for heating (and cooking), which has nothing to do with its grid power.

Even now, 10 years after stopping to invest in nuclear, Germany is still generating more power via nuclear plants than via gas plants because [Gas is that irrelevant in grid production.](https://strom-report.de/medien/strommix-2020-stromerzeugung-deutschland-1-615x459.jpg)

Germany buys Russian Gas to redistribute into Europe, and for heating. Don't conflate it with nuclear power generation. And it did most certainly not ""create an artificial demand"" for it. Germany stayed power export nation, during the entirety of the nuclear exit.",1647704828.0,34

Germany always had a major opposition against nuclear power. Every study for atomic repositories was heavily contested, every transport of nuclear waste was followed by large protests and even attempts of sabotage by disabiling the railway on which the transport relied. I read a famous childrensbook against nuclear energy in school (""Die Wolke/The Cloud""), and most germans have either read the book aswell or have seen the very popular film adaptation of it. You could see ""Nuclear energy, no thank you"" stickers everywhere.

I too am staunchly against nuclear power. If you build Nuclear plants, one day one will blow up, nothing is 100% safe, and if you do it in the middle of europe, you are in danger of contaminating densly populated areas for potentially decades. Here is what i wrote in another comment about it:

""And it's not a hypothetical scenario either. I've looked into it a bit a year ago. Do you know, why Fukushima went critical? There were major architectural and engineering flaws, like badly build sensors (they showed reducing pressure even though the pressure was increasing) or batteries in the cellar (that got flooded) , but also the crew forgot to open a valve to the emergency condenser unit, a system that works without energy by cooling the steam and thus reduces pressure. It was human failure. That can happen everywhere, no matter how theoretical save a reactor is, people make mistakes under stress and it showed in Japan 2010. If you build nuclear reactors, one day one is gonna explode.

And while I'm at Fukushima: Japan got lucky that the wind turned on day 3 or 4 towards the open sea, otherwise Tokio would have had to be evacuated. How do you evacuate 40 million people, that's right, you don't. Panic would have ensued. A nightmare.People always point to Fukushima and say, look, nothing really bad happened even in this unique scenario, forgetting how LUCKY people were.""

This is how democracies work. The population wanted to get rid of nuclear power (not because of panic) and our leaders had to listen, even more so after fukushima. Our mistake wasnt that we got rid of a dangerous technology, but that we didnt heavily invest into regenerative sources. Critizise us for that latter, not the former.",1647706502.0,4

8675,worldnews,Poland proposes total EU ban on trade with Russia,,1647690301.0,1197,32376,0.95,Lost-My-Mind-,"Well see a ""dick"" is common slang for a ""penis"", which is the male reproductive organ. These can come in various sizes, and having a large one is generally seen to be something to be proud of. If you confidently show off your penis, you're seen as being the alpha in a situation. This generally attracts women who want to stick this penis inside their vagina for reproductive, or recreational purposes. 

A ""pussy"" is common slang for ""vagina"", which is the female reproductive organ. And while the previous post barely mentioned vaginas, they are seen as being fragile and weak, due to a double standard in society. When in reality, the male reproductive organs are the ones which are sensitive and weak, more specifically the testicles. When inflicted any pain, the testicle reacts to this sudden blunt force with much more pain than any other part of the human body. Whereas the vagina can and does literally stretch so far as to push a human child out of it when needed. Still though, the fact remains that ""Dicks"" are seen as the strong powerful imagery, while ""Pussies"" are seen as the weak submissive types.

And an ""asshole"" is common slang for the rectal sphincter. It's medical purpose is to allow an opening to allow human waste to pass out of the human body, while closing tight when not in use, as to not allow foreign particles inside. However, a common practice among both heterosexuals, and especially homosexuals is to use the asshole as a sexual recreational bodily opening in which to have sexual intercourse. A societal outlook is that assholes are bad, due to their usage of human waste that passes through them. So to be viewed at as an asshole, would be to say you are scum. 

And ""Team America"" is a 2004 American film by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who also created the popular Comedy Central series ""South Park"". The film depicts and mocks an unrelenting use of patriotic imagery to make fun of people with such patriotic feelings masking their lack of a personality. The film was in direct response to a post 9/11 world, in which many Americans let their patriotism get out of hand. 

So the post above is essentially saying that Putin, Kim Jong Un and Assad are the scum of this planet while China and the United States are big and powerful with confidence in theirselves. 

He's also implying that the entirety of the EU needs to develop some confidence so they can be seen as big and powerful, so they too may play on the world stage with the other powerful nations.

You have argued precisely the following:

>Its dishonest to believe that Germany adopting a harder stance won't make a significant difference.

To which I point out, that Germany adopted a very significant stance during the refugee crisis 2015, counter to many other EU countries. When it did, it sparked great outrage that Germany's open door policy shouldn't speak for the EU and that this move might call European Unity, specifically,[ the Schengen accord, into question.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-sarkozy-idUSKCN0RA1LI20150910)

So arguing that Germany's ""stance making a significant difference"" is enough justification for singling it out in media reports is a fallacy. If the other countries in the EU have issues with the policy, they will not follow, regardless of Germany's stance. 

>Trying to deflect fault from one nation by showcasing another nations failing is whataboutism.

I am just tired of reading ""Germany BAD"" on half these articles when this is a thing that many EU countries share.

Putin threatens (present tense) to use nukes if we try too hard to help save civilian lives. So if we successfully get him to say ‚Äúoops, you caught me, giggle giggle‚Äù some want to have a reset? No way. 

Putin is permanent persona non grata. Milosevic style. Bin Laden style even. Only one way out for Putin. Qaddafi style. This is not a one time bad decision moment. This is the result of a lifetime of cruelty, murder, destroying the hope of Russians for decades. He has pilfered the state coffers and crushed his people and murdered his political foes on foreign territory. He controls nukes and wages war using those nukes as a shield. 

Not only must Putin go, but certain safeguards must happen to avoid someone else like him taking his place. I personally would like to see a non nuclear Russia, if possible.

This is not true... Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

I'll just paste a couple comments I read that explains it:

This is a false / disproven notion by historians, and a bit of history which was deliberate propaganda on part of the inter-war and eventually Nazi government. Part of the reason we had so much issue until recently is much of these documents of the old Imperial German government were held in Prussia, which was annexed by the Soviet Union after WW2-- so we really only started to get in depth documents proving us right in the 90s. 
An accessible book to serve as an introduction to this is ""The Great War: Myth & Memory"" by Dr. Dan Todman, ""The Myth of Reparations"" by Dr. Sally Marks (easily one of the most influential historians on inter-war Europe) if you want a more involved piece, and the principle paper on the matter imo, ""Clio Deceived: Patrotic Self-Censorship in Germany after the Great War"" by Dr. Holger Herwig, who's the leading living historian on early 20th Century Germany. 



The TL;DR is: Germany was capable of paying back every last cent of reparations, and between '18-'23, deliberately sabotaged their own economy to undermine French reconstruction & get reparations reduced. From '23 to '29, after putting in a competent Reichsbank Commissioner who wasn't purposefully sacking their economy, they had a meteoric financial recovery, and even then more than half of the reparations forgiven by the Entente. Remnants of the Imperial government in Weimar hid & destroyed evidence of this and spent millions of marks on a propaganda campaign within England to paint Germans as the victims of oppressive French revanchism.

---------------------------

> Germany was capable of paying back every last cent of reparations



To add to this, they had substantial help from America and American banks/banking system as well. Both the Dawes and Young plan (look em up kids) gave Germany more than enough assistance to help. Dawes pumped hundreds of millions into the German economy, with the idea that the product of this investment would pay off the investors and then the reparation's. While the Young plan forgave 20% or so of the total right off the bat and established very favourable repayment terms. Terms that eventually didn't matter cause Germany defaulted a couple years later and all the reparation's were forgiven anyways.



During the reparation period, Germany probably received more in foreign government investment and assistance (bonds and the like) than it paid in reparations. It's usually estimated 20-30 billion paid, 30-50 billion received. Germany made money on the reparations.



Don't get me wrong. Germany was economically bankrupted *following WW1 (twice actually, hyperinflation of 23, and the Great Depression). 


But the reparations played no part in that. It was German propaganda then, and it still is now.

This didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere; Putin‚Äôs health is being openly debated right now. He‚Äôs pushing back on very specific rumours.

The Kremlin released an official photo of Putin earlier in the week, and instead of projecting power, people saw a man they thought looked bloated and ashen faced. It contributed to speculation that he has malignant bowel cancer. Some thought the bloating could be from steroids to fight the cancer.

There are also a couple of videos of Putin struggling with his hands. They seem to shake uncontrollably - the right side more than the left. Some think it could be a form of Parkinson‚Äôs-like illness induced by the malignant cancer. There‚Äôs one video where the hand shakes wildly, and another where it looks like dead weight as he tries to wave.

And frankly, the violence of cancer is more Putin's style, but impartial justice, his very antithesis, would suit him and the rest of us far better in the pages of history and for his many victims, in Chechnya and Ukraine and Moldova (Transnistria) and Russia itself.

He must take responsibility or be found responsible, impartially. We cannot deny him fair justice even when he has never believed in the idea himself, and I look no further than even the Nazis at Nuremberg, evil and corruption incarnate, receiving trials.

All men die, even dictators. Many escape justice. He need not.",1647701199.0,5

I didn't search for it, but I guess that kind of info might be available publicly. There were a bit less than 500 000 employees in the KGB structure, it's a massive public branch with lots of basic jobs, so people would expect KGB to be everywhere and quite common. The training he took might also have been just some weird basic training all agents had. Not to be hidden like the illegals/clandestines were, just a kind of basic self-defense in case of an abduction attempt or just basic ambush like probably most military/police have. Maybe the training was to be used in special cases and agents abuse it as a kind of fashion, or to make a statement like: ""see, I have kgb training"". A kind of show off.

Use the social Security calculator


The Social Security Administration maintains a¬†life expectancy calculator¬†that will tell you the average number of additional years a person with your date of birth and gender can expect to live. Using this calculator, a 65-year-old woman born on Jan. 1, 1955, has a life expectancy of 86.6 years. And if she makes it to age 70, her life expectancy increases to 87.6 years. A man the same age has an average life expectancy of 84.1 years.

> A top official has suggested that U.S. President Joe Biden should meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv when he travels to Europe for a NATO summit on March 24.

> Ihor Zhovka, the Ukrainian president&#039;s deputy chief of staff, told CNN on Thursday that Biden should show that he is &quot;Brave&quot; by meeting Zelensky face to face in Ukraine, as other world leaders have.

> When CNN&#039;s Wolf Blitzer asked Zhovka whether Zelensky will try to meet Biden in person while he is in Europe, he replied: &quot;Well, just this week, three prime ministers of three friendly nations-Poland, Czech Republic and Slovenia-visited personally, so why not President Biden comes to Ukraine to meet my president?&quot;.

Knowing full well what it would mean for Russia and knowing that an attack on America would basically untie the hands of the next President to get America into the war.

The concept of Biden traveling to Kyiv would force the American Armed forces to secure both the ground and the airspace over Ukraine. There would be a need for F-35 entering and paroling the Ukrainian airspace, Apache helicopters providing close air support, Troops at the airport, armored vehicles protecting the motorcade, intelligence gathering planes monitoring the entire region and Secret service agents all over the place.

It would force Russia to interrupt its air war over Ukraine at least for a day and would allow America to create a corridor between Poland and Kyiv for at least a day.

Humanitarian and weapon convoys could take advantage of this corridor to make deliveries directly into Kyiv... And it would show Putin that all of his threats are useless.

There is zero chance anyone would allow the president to set foot in the area unless it's completely secure first.

I see it as a roundabout way of daring the US to send troops.

This isn't about personal bravery, the death of a sitting US president is destabilizing to the entire country and could immediately force the US into war.

Edit: What some replies are forgetting is that even if Putin/Russian command has no interest in harming Biden, he would still be very vulnerable to rogue actors. It's a chaotic situation with a lot of weapons present, including modern portable anti-vehicle and anti-aircraft systems.

Anyone even remotely suspicious they ask that they don't come in that day. No doubt they have marksman in elevated positions. And that's for the US, yet alone somewhere actively under attack.             

The presidential limousine is in all likelihood the most armored ""civilian"" vehicle in the world, it's actually built on a truck chassis and designed to look like a normal stretch limousine but if you ever look at the size, the thickness of the doors and windows it is far from normal; hence why it comedically got stuck a few years back when it was in Dublin.        


I just don't see it happening.       
They'll need an armored division, squadrons of Army helicopters and Air Force jet aircraft, and quite possibly a thousand or more troops on the ground to secure every corner to do this. Not to mention they'd have the US Navy roll up into the Black Sea with a literal fleet.      

The undertaking of getting the entourage that would have to accompany the POTUS into an active war zone would be similar in scope to an armed intervention. The logistical challenges, the man power, the money would not be something to scoff at. All so Biden could have a chat with Zelenskyy. If they did this, those US troops would be *pissed* at the waste of time and money since they wouldn't even be able to help Ukraine.        

If the POTUS forced his hand and made the Secret Service to agree to such a thing, the amount of military forces that will have to be moved can quite seriously be enough to topple a country or defeat many militaries of those countries in a conventional war. (not accounting for resupplying)

Allow me to clarify: they are *currently standing* because of the West's constant military support since 2014 that has only amplified since the war, and financial *warfare* on Russia.

I know it's easy to personify a nation, but in the grand scheme of things a nation's desperation isn't really the same blind ""drowning, flailing and grabbing onto others"" personal panic. They have a choice in how they present themselves. Hell, in the beginning of the war before Russia fully revealed themselves to be trash, Ukraine's government was doing *great* in keeping poise, and that was when things were initially, truly bleak. 

There is no such thing as ""all they are getting."" That implies they *deserve* more. That Ukraine *deserves* to have NATO's people die for them en masse. But they don't. That implies that the West is cheaping out and turning a blind eye. But they aren't. That implies that they are entitled to... frankly *anything* from NATO. But they aren't. That's the cold truth: NATO didn't need to do anything, because if Russia touches NATO, they die.

Getting into the fight is and should be NATO's choice, because Ukraine isn't a part of NATO. 

It is like a homeless man harassing you(and also trying to *con* you) because you gave them a hundred dollars instead of inviting them into your home like family.

In 1855 a military book ‚ÄúConsiderations on Tactics and Strategy‚Äù quotes Napoleon giving advice to his marshals [GT]:  
Previous to the commencement (tactically speaking) of the battle of Austerlitz, the allies attempted a flank march in column to turn the right flank of Napoleon. He restrained his marshals, who were eager to attack, saying, ‚Äúthe enemy is making a false move, why should we interrupt him?‚Äù  
  
In 1852 a biographical magazine also quotes Napoleon giving advice to his marshals [BM]:  
‚ÄúThen, gentlemen,‚Äù said Napoleon, ‚Äúlet us wait a little; when your enemy is executing a false movement, never interrupt him.‚Äù  
  
An 1836 multi-volume history book titled ‚ÄúFrench Revolution‚Äù contains a version of the quotation that is similar to the one given in 1852. This history book dates the quotation to a battle in 1805. These words may have been transformed into the modern maxim [FR]:  
‚ÄúIn that case,‚Äù said Napoleon, ‚Äúlet us wait twenty minutes; when the enemy is making a false movement we must take good care not to interrupt him.‚Äù

That being said, I am forever grateful that Trump didn‚Äôt get re-elected a second term and that he isn‚Äôt president during this crisis, and that republicans have started to drop his cult-like following en-masse. Could you imagine what the outcome could have been here if he got re-elected for a second term and was still our president? 

Instead of the sheer massive fuckup we‚Äôre seeing this might have been Putin‚Äôs greatest achievement he has ever had and the worst disaster to ever hit NATO and the UN. Trump was so on-board with Putin that he would have most likely proposed/been enticed to funnel weapons to Russian forces rather than Ukraine for their sovereign self-defense, and the Senate republican majority would have backed him or vetoed any house resolutions to stop it because ‚Äúown the dems‚Äù. 

Russia would be ultimately successful in taking over Ukraine and the most critical sanctions against Russia (the US sanctions) wouldn‚Äôt have happened or would likely be seriously toned down, thus boosting the Russian economy instead of dismantling it. Putin would probably undertake more invasions of the other separated USSR countries to reunite a super-power. Other nations in the UN would now be extremely alarmed at the way we and Russia handled the situation and since we are two permanent members it would go against the very foundations of the organization, in which the US is arguably the most important leader. NATO would be permanently disabled from member nations wanting to back-out due to the repercussions of supporting a hostile invasion of a sovereign nation, thus giving Putin everything that he ever wanted to achieve.

Teutoburg Forest is commonly seen as one of the most important defeats in Roman history, bringing the triumphant period of expansion under Augustus to an abrupt end. The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[7] The provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior, sometimes collectively referred to as Roman Germania, were subsequently established in northeast Roman Gaul, while territories beyond the Rhine remained independent of Roman control. Retaliatory campaigns were commanded by Tiberius and Germanicus and would enjoy success, but the Rhine would eventually become the border between the Roman Empire and the rest of Germania. The Roman Empire would launch no other major incursion into Germania until Marcus Aurelius (r. 161‚Äì180) during the Marcomannic Wars. - wikipedia",1647687418.0,6

There's basically a faction of the right wing that saw Russia as a potential ally against China. The goal was to ditch NATO and the EU, who they saw as weak and not willing to pull their own weight, and embrace Russia to form a USA+Russia aligned alliance vs. China. I've listened to John Mearsheimer's talks about Russia and he is very eloquent about this stance. ""America should play nice with Russia, and align itself with Russia to counterbalance China instead of pushing Russia into an alliance with the Chinese"" is the gist of his stance.

Which is honestly stupid as all hell from my point of view. After Iraq and Afghanistan I do not trust anything the GOP has to say geopolitically. Their ideas are frankly way too idealistic while being disguised as realpolitik realism. It's the same arrogant 'America can do anything' attitude that makes them think we can do better without NATO that got us into those two quagmire wars.

Also, as if Russia wouldn't stab us in the back at first opportunity. Russia has never had long term friendship with any great power, only long term friendly relationships with countries that they dominate culturally and militarily. A potential alliance with Russia would be just as shaky as one with the USSR in WWII, for all the same reasons. We'd be tossing away NATO allies that we have almost 100 years of stable and cordial relationship with, for a guy holding a dagger behind his back.

USA and Russia are ideologically distant, and you cannot maintain a long term alliance when both countries see each other as military rivals instead of military partners.",1647701089.0,14

 >The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, described as the Varian Disaster (Clades Variana) by Roman historians, took place at modern Kalkriese in 9 AD, when an alliance of Germanic peoples ambushed Roman legions and their auxiliaries, led by Publius Quinctilius Varus. The alliance was led by Arminius, a Germanic officer of Varus's auxilia. Arminius had acquired Roman citizenship and had received a Roman military education, which enabled him to deceive the Roman commander methodically and anticipate the Roman army's tactical responses.

The movies he had been in hadn't done well, his popularity as a singer was fading,  he couldn't get performing gigs,  his voice was having issues and he was almost broke. He had left his first wife and taken up with Ava Gardner. All in all, Cohn had a point. 

When Cohn turned Sinatra down for the role,  Frank reached out to his mob connections. One mafia Underboss and one powerful Hollywood agent meeting later, Sinatra was asked to come in and test for the role. Cohn never spoke about that meeting publicly but years later,  he implied that he had been threatened by Sinatra's pals.

Does this sound familiar?",1647688966.0,3

 After he broke up with the woman who made him look like a fool, he got with Mia farrow so no one could call him a little boy again. Ok that last part was conjecture but he did get married and abuse a very young Mia farrow. She was 20, he was 49. He divorced her because she refused to quit acting.

Both him and the rat pack were more woven into the the culture of our parents so as kids we were more likely to hear about them and things like Frank's connection with the mob. We were also more likely to see older movies with them in it, plus talk show appearances and so on which obviously aren't happening anymore...

For instance people I know at work in their 20's are far less likely to be familiar with 60's and 70's culture for those reasons, those people's parents imbued them with the 80's and 90's stuff they grew up with. For instance I was talking to someone who's mid twenties about that what we do in the shadows episode that has the rat pack impersonators in it and they had no idea who they were supposed to be and didn't get all the jokes related to it. Sure some younger people will know it but just like I was way less familiar with culture that my Grandma grew up with on average younger people are less familiar with that 1950-70's period.",1647635777.0,40

Chief Keef, YG, Young Thug, Nipsey Hussle, etc are from 300 block Black Disciples, Fruit Town Piru, SMM Blood gang, and Rolling 60s Crips, respectively.

A modern day Frank Sinatra would be more along the lines of Drake or Chris Brown, as their known for being softies in real life who never were in that gang/criminal life but sought it out as adults to give them some ""street cred."" Drake brags about being managed by J Prince, former owner/CEO of Rap-A-Lot Records who is known to be involved in some grimy street business. When Drake was punched in the shoulder by P Diddy, J Prince made a YouTube video threatening P Diddy and his famiy. Even TMZ reported on it.

Chris Brown is from Virginia I think, rich since like 16 years old, but once in his mid-20s he started claiming Fruit Town Piru, a Compton street gang.

It might have been inspired by a number of people but some of the stuff does seem rather specific. For example, Margot (Fontane's second wife) makes fun of him for his style of lovemaking - ""you even make love like a kid. You still think screwing is really like those dopey songs you used to sing."" Meanwhile, Sinatra's second wife Ava Gardner allegedly confided that, ""With him [Frank], it's impossible... It's like being with a woman. He's so gentle. It's as though he thinks I'll break, as though I'm a piece of Dresden china, and he's gonna hurt me.""

Kanye briefly made it cool to be a square in around 2005-2008. But once Chicago drill music got popular he started trying to act gangster. For his last album *Donda*, he started claiming a Chicago street gang, Gangster Disciples, sold *Donda* merchandise using the GD symbol of the 6 point star, referred to GD founder and leader Larry Hoover as his ""father,"" and let GD rapper Rooga perform the GD anthem at the Donda listening party/concert.

Drake, who originally followed in Kanye's square foot steps also has recently bragged about his ""mob ties"" to J Prince. 

Chris Brown, an R&B singer, started claiming a Compton street gang, Fruit Town Piru.

Debbie was not a dancer when she worked on Singin‚Äô in the Rain. At that point, she only had background skills as a gymnast. During the filming, Gene Kelly had insulted her for the lack of dancing experience, which made the young actress quite upset.

>After the insult, Debbie was found crying under a piano by Fred Astaire, who happened to be around. He comforted the young actress and helped her with the dancing.

Kelly was reportedly difficult¬†in the rehearsals for¬†Singin'¬†in the Rain, and¬†his¬†overstepping of boundaries¬†didn‚Äôt stop there. Debbie Reynolds, 19 years old at the time, recalled¬†one particularly unpleasant moment during filming:

The camera closed in. Gene took me tightly in his arms...¬†and shoved his tongue down my throat.
‚ÄúEeew! What was that?‚Äù I screeched, breaking free of his grasp and spitting. I ran around frantic, yelling for some Coca-Cola to cleanse my mouth. It was the early 1950s, and I was an innocent kid who had never been French-kissed... I was stunned that this 39-year-old man would do this to me.

And from Esther Williams:

Perhaps the snappiest condemnation of Kelly came from Esther Williams. She¬†reportedly said¬†of the actor, ‚ÄúHe was a jerk, but he could dance!‚Äù¬†Williams had reason to be irritated. She¬†described her time¬†working with Kelly on¬†Take Me Out to the Ball Game¬†as ‚Äúpure misery.""¬†
During the filming of the movie, Kelly grew¬†irritated that his costar was taller than him,¬†and he often made her slouch during their scenes together. During one take in which Williams was seated, he said of her, ‚ÄùYou know something? This sonofab*tch even¬†sits¬†tall!‚Äù

(At this point we really should start calling it what it is: rape.) 

Some of them wrote songs about it which STILL generate royalties today because they wound up released and became fucking HIT SINGLES. See Ted Nugent, Motorhead, Winger, and The Outfield for some fantastic examples of songs specifically about raping children. 

It's a bit less likely with female rock stars, but it still happened. 

If they didn't actually rape a minor, the odds are still really good that they raped **someone**. Many bands and artists in their own biographies have owned up to this. How anyone remains a fan of Motley Crue after reading The Dirt (fuck the film, it tells 2% of the story, and does even that small amount poorly and full of falsehoods)... those ""men"" are horrible, catastrophic piles of shit. Just by way of example. 

The transformation from ""starving on the streets"", or however close to that they were, to ""unlimited money, nothing is ever denied, everyone everywhere knows my name, tens of thousands scream my name from the audience"" can and usually does **really fuck people up**.

More importantly, this isn't about age or time period. What's fucked-up today was just as fucked-up 600 years ago, even if the people of that time didn't think so. 

There's a great film out there. ""Almost Famous"". The movie's not about rape, because there's a different story being told. Believe it or not I do love the film. It takes place in the early 70's. And, if you have any sense of *what is actually happening*, you kinda wake up really early in the film and realize that part of what you're watching is a band made up of 20-something men, most with wives back home, having sex with (raping) a bunch of (very willing) young teenagers. A couple of the actresses were chosen, costumed, and made up in a way which REALLY shows it, too (Anna Paquin is the ur-example). It's such a good film that you can really just roll with it, but its there all the same. 

The arguments are always the same: ""Girls were more mature back then"" (no, they weren't. The facts of biology all by themselves tell us as much), or ""I know this girl who was only 14 and she was SO mature"" (no, she isn't, she has just learned how to talk like and TO adults, and may have been through some shit). 

Or people want to debate the age-of-maturity in legal terms, which is total horseshit. A 28 year old man might not be raping an 18 year old in legal terms, but that's still WILDLY fucked up. If 18 is the point where she can legally say ""yes"", is it ok when she's part of a stable of 8 women all her age who all have to climb in bed each night with some octogenarian and have sex with him in order to have a place to live and the hope of a career (go piss on Hefner's grave. Please.)? What level of coercion and manipulation makes it rape? Because the 28 year old guy who has a decade on the girl he's having sex with? He has experience she does not. So whether he just worked the ""older man"" charm or she's so damaged that she just threw herself at him, the power dynamic is not equal in any sense.",1647633856.0,2

Perhaps not considered a ""good"" movie by a lot of people (I'm honestly not sure on what people think of it these days because I don't know many people aware of it's existence), but still a really interesting story. Growing up, I stumbled across the [audiobook of the screenplay's novelization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgDtiKpevvo) at my local library and absolutely fell in love with the story. Seeing the movie, there was a lot they were able to do, but many of the smaller elements that helped give more structure to the story were removed for time. There's even a cut of the movie released in Japan that had additional footage and was a little bit more cohesive, though still not entirely there.

I feel like if it was a movie that was given the time to explore the elements of loss (the loss of Johnny's memories of his childhood contrasted against Takahashi's moruning the loss of his daughter), the connections of the mysterious Woman who's tied into everything from the shadows of the Internet, and overall just take the time to really sink into this dingy, bleak futuristic world filled with a lingering sense of paranoia, but still with a glimmer of hope for a better tomorrow",1647709885.0,2

I've seen 90 minute movies, 4 hour long movies, and whole seasons of television that execute a tight story, so I don't mean any of those would have been better if they were shorter, but it really just depends on the thing.

Examples of why a good movie is often long enough would be extended cut releases of films that are no better or worse than their theatrical versions. They are nice curiosities for people who already saw and liked the original, but it also just feels like... more, an unnecessary but interesting chunk of more, and if people in the theater originally saw it that way, the magic of the film would have worn off before its conclusion, reducing the impact of a tighter experience.

Conversely, a bad movie might be made better by walking out or shutting it off, but a cut down version of that movie could skip over elements that make it, on some minor level, watchable. For an example of this, consider bad movies that had better director's cut releases. Suddenly the movie is easier to follow because time was taken to thread things together with patience. That doesn't make it good, but it does make it less bad.",1647663733.0,1

He lorded over lands that were nearby The Shire that the Hobbits legitimately had to walk through to get where they were headed without making a massive detour, so it was essentially fated that they meet - which is important to the story because, at this point, the Hobbits were essentially defenseless and Tom blatantly saved them from ""bad"" trees like Old Man Willow, a barrow-wight, and a number of other things apart from going through said land being the method they used to lose the black riders that were on their tail. 

He was also an example of how not every exceedingly powerful being in Middle Earth was evil or ill-willed or driven on some sort of quest or mission - and I'm not talking about Gandalf power, I'm talking about like God-status, been-here-since-the-beginning-of-time, bend-the-world-around-you-at-your-whim sort of power. Power to the extent that he was one of the only beings in Middle Earth whom the ring had absolutely no affect on to the point he couldn't even use it. His power was even higher than that of the one ring, a ring that even tempted the minds of Gandalf and Galadriel. On top of all of that, it's his portion of the story in the Barrow-downs where the Hobbits gain ancient swords to help them on their quest, as well as shows a change in Merry's personality when he comes out of the death-like trance the wight had him under. 

Tom and his portion of the book add a lot of mystery and depth to the lore of the overarching story, and beyond that he literally saved the Hobbits' lives multiple times. IMHO he absolutely serves a purpose to the plot of the story and in some ways he's even an important character. If he didn't exist, half the potential Fellowship would have more than likely been lost at Barrow-downs and the one ring more than likely would have been recovered by the Barrow-wight that was sent there by the Witch King of Angmar, and delivered to Sauron thusly. 

He just wasn't necessary in the films because, like an absolute ton of the the rest of the events of the book, he and his forest were cut for pacing reasons and to make the events of the film seem like they happened over the course of a few weeks instead of several years.

If they cut out the 17 years between Bilbo's 111th Birthday and Gandalf coming back to plan with Frodo, as well as the scouring of the Shire, it's not surprising they'd cut out Tom's entire portion of the book as well as (seemingly) his entire existence in the films.

I would have much rather have seen the Hobbits venture through Tom's land than what we got in the film, which is essentially the Hobbits hiding in a ditch, tricking Kham√ªl the nazgul by throwing vegetables, and making their way to Bree with nearly nothing eventful happening other than said hiding in a ditch.",1647690220.0,5

The story was effectively over, the emotional climax had already been reached, we're just following through and tying up loose ends at that point.

Jackson had already, *somehow* , gotten away with cramming **two separate** climactic battles in the third act (Pelennor Fields and the battle at the Black Gate), and made it work so that the audience didn't feel emotionally saturated by the time it got to the last one. It would've been, quite simply, unthinkable to try and cram in a *third* climactic battle too. There's only so much the audience will stay emotionally invested for; once you've passed a certain point, the crowd will, quite simply, cease to care.

Plus, I know that there's all the thematic implications with the Scouring and all.... but in *pure storyline* terms, it's pretty unnecessary. The war is already over. The big bad has already been defeated. The hero's journey we've been following for the past three movies has already been completed. As far as the viewing audience is concerned, *that's it*. Story's over, climax done, good night everybody. Everything past that is just filler.

TL;DR: after seeing the glorious and heroic two final battles, adding in the Scouring at the end would've been the very definition of *anti-climactic*. It would've completely ruined the third act, and thus all of the audience's emotional enjoyment of the story.

To have life, you need a way to store information in molecules that can be replicated. Carbon chains are some of the most flexible chemicals in terms of stability and also ease of covalent bonding with a range of atoms, forming more complicated functional groups. The issue is there are a finite number of elements to work with. About 90 or so. Carbon is the best of these. Water is then a useful choice because it has oxygen and hydrogen in it, two of the elements that work best with carbon.

Next, you need life to be in the liquid phase. That's just a practical issue. Gases will just float apart, and solids don't really work because if I have a pile of nutrients over here and a pile of nutrients over there that need to mix, they don't just jump onto each other. liquids naturally facilitate the mixing of chemicals, and so all life that we know of is liquid-based (your cells are full of liquid, called cytoplasm).

Once you have down that it needs to be a liquid, and you need to use carbon, you get restricted a bit in terms of temperature, because too hot and the carbon molecules you built out of carbon start to fall apart, and too cold and the reaction rates necessary for life get too slow (this is intuitive but reactions happen slower or not at all at low temperatures). So not too hot, not too cold.

The last piece is you really need a solvent that is polar. This means that it has positive and negative ends. That's because polar solvents can dissolve other polar molecules (letting them move around) but don't dissolve non-polar molecules (so they can stay put together and do things). Having this ability to have some things get moved around and others stay together points to having a polar solvent, and Water happens to be a very polar solvent.

Water ticks all of these boxes better than basically anything else. It's possible you could have life in a different liquid solvent like Dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol, but these other choices are either more complicated and unlikely to form a lot of naturally, or are too unstable and could lead to chain reactions with oxygen that result in the production of water anyway.",1647704914.0,9

This could also be used on future solar panels that trap heat for use in solar assisted heat pumps. 

A heat pump installation with a ground source using vertical borehole loops would typically require three 70 to 100 meter deep loops. 

But these passively recharge and have a low temperature, boosting the temperature by running the loop in charge mode from a heat pump that was powered by such a solar PV-thermal collector in the summer and on warmer, sunnier days, could allow the loop to provide several times the capacity.

At ¬£25 to ¬£40 per meter the quoted drilling costs for such systems, slashing the number of bore holes needed, i.e. from 3 to 1, would present the potential for large installation savings.

I do study psychology so I was looking for statistics. Either way, psychology is not black and white; culture, knowledge transfer and factors like economy affect what and how people behave, especially when it comes to resources or lack thereof. Some people can afford thinking about such things, while others do not, for instance.

It is not trouble with executive function either. I am one of the people who after getting vaccinated took off the mask when I can afford, unlike before, and no longer use rubbing alcohol to clean my hands or items, because covid's transmission through the things we touch is minimal, and being vaccinated further decreases the already low chance of contracting it, and not it is not just me, many people did the same after getting the vaccine. 

Plus, the majority wore masks out of fear of the virus, and believed vaccines gave total immunity to the virus (hence why we had/still have misinformation about it not doing its work, simply because people misunderstand lower chance of hospitalization with total immunity), so once they received the vaccine, they no longer wore masks, and that includes pretty much every single one in my country, hence my experience and the ""They wore masks, but after the vaccine did not because they believed there was no reason to"".

It seems that you are defining ""prevents"" as a 100% effective method and by that definition condoms and birth-control don't prevent pregnancy since they only dramatically reduce the likelihood of it. Vaccines arent magic shields that make it impossible to get it, but what it does is makes it far less likely that you will get it and if you do you will be contagious for less time (thus spreading it less) and your symptoms will be dramatically reduced. When you're unvaccinated you are 12 times more likely to be hospitalized from it so if everyone were unvaccinated, the hospitals would have way more patients to deal with like we have seen happening before vaccines numbers went up.

How is this relevant to the context that the vaccine was referred to?

>no? what's J&J's track record on ethics & transparency?

I'm beginning to suspect you aren't coming to this discussion in good faith, or you have poor comprehension. J&J is irrelevant here, for two reasons:
1. The thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was picked up by the CDC, not J&J, and the frequency was so rare that in a study size of 40000 people, it's unlikely anyone in the study would have suffered it, whether you think they would cover it up or not.

2. The risk of myocarditis is well known in the mRNA vaccines, and as I said, the CDC has publicly broadcast the connection since May 2021. 


>The CDC has been hiding data. Where do you get your info?

It's what you might call ""doing your research"". Open a search engine, set a date range no later than may 2021, and search the appropriate keywords.

Since I already did it, and I doubt you will, here are some results:

Goldfish do not grow to fit the container, they have a natural size they grow to and in captivity they're often stunted by poor nutrition, or simply die young and small.

Keeping them in containers that are too small causes internal deformities and usually early death. (They are supposed to live for decades--the oldest goldfish lived for over 40 years.)

""Yamatokoriyama: a town whose long history is intimately interwoven with goldfish

The custom of keeping goldfish is believed to date back more than 2,000 years. Goldfish are believed to have come originally from reddish-colored specimens that were discovered among the wild carp that live in southern China. Goldfish came to Japan in the middle of the Muromachi Period (1336-1573); at this time, goldfish were kept by the nobility and wealthy people of the day for their personal amusement.""

We once endured a lecture from a budo professor (because japan worship happens in japan as well as all the weebs).

Every time he brought up a ""bushido code"" thing in front of some hundred hard core budo people they asked ""What about so and so in year X with so and so""

The answer was always basically ""oh but he really wanted to, so it's okay"".

My opinion is samurai were once bloodthirsty and successful fighters that became a caste system and then the wars stopped and they became public servants to earn money then they became mythologised and then politicised. 

So any reference to samurai obviously needs to be ""at this point in history"" qualified to even remotely have a hint of what it means.

The ones with fortune cookies (although I don't see them that often here) are completely americanized; stuff like ""mongolian beef"" or ""general tao's (or tsao or tso or however many other variations on the name) chicken"" doesn't exist in China and no one in China would have heard of it. 

This is especially true for places where there isn't a huge chinese dispora like in vancouver/toronto/LA etc. 

Now in terms of the restuarants here, where there is a very significant chinese population (a few years ago, there was outrage in Richmond, a suburb city of greater vancouver because so many stores don't have ANY english at all), it's mostly because of several factors (IMO; I'm not a researcher, this is just what I feel like is happening):

1. A difference in ingredients. It's not that Chinese ingredients are more ""fresh"" (or as many people think, worse); but it's different. For example, I eat a lot of beef, it's my favorite meat. But I avoid beef in China like the plague because it's absolutely horrible and harder than shoe leather. On the other hand, there are other things (like tofu) that is much better (and there are a lot more different types) in China. And the types of vegetables that are common is slightly different too; scallions/green onions in China is different from what I get here in supermarkets just as one example.

2. It's a lot better now, but even 10 years ago, a lot of commonly used Chinese ingredients like various types of fermented pastes and veggies, sauces, spices etc couldn't be easily found here. So people have to use substitutes. 

3. There's a mixture of various regional cuisines; China has 1.3 billion people, and is one of the largest countries in the world in terms of size. So there are lots of regional differences between different parts of China; it's like British cuisine, French cuisine and Italian cuisine might be concerned different, but there's probably even more variance in Chinese cuisine. But that kind of gets all mixed up here, and the differences between different types of chinese cuisine isn't as pronounced. And almost everything here has cantonese influences because such a huge percentage of the Chinese dispora in NA was cantonese (before ~2005 or so). Whereas in mainland China, Cantonese cuisine is limited to the province of Guangzhou and restuarants that specifically make cantonese cuisine elsewhere. It isn't blended into other regional cuisines.

edit: Oh, also, there's stuff that's really popular and cheap in China, and likely popular because it's cheap, but there's very little of it here because the costs of creating the same thing would be much higher, and no one would buy it at such a high price.

For example, Lan Zhou beef noodle soup is AMAZING. I try to have it as much as I can when I go back to China. 
But I can't find a single lan zhou beef noodle soup restaurant here. 

Another thing is yang rou chuan; charcoal grilled lamb skewers (although I personally like the beef tendons, chicken, enoki mushroom, cabbage skewers more, but I digress) is super famous and popular around China. 

I'd eat like 50 skewers a meal, because it used to be about 3 for 1RMB back 15 years ago, and is still like 1-2RMB per skewer. So like, 20 bucks a meal, not too pricey.

But a place tried to make those skewers here, but went out of business because they're not making any profit, despite selling a skewer for $3.5 each. No way I'm spending $150-200 on a meal. 

There's also my favorite breakfast ever; tofu brains. And a lot more.",1647706833.0,4

This was back when there was a thin tissue on the border, it was very easy to move between the countries. Still, he didn't have a permanent resident permit (ie green card) until 1970, so all his recording and performing work in the US was as an illegal immigrant, including his appearance at Woodstock. So...

If he did hot-wire a truck, or even participated in stealing a truck, he committed a felony, and had he been caught, would have been immediately expelled from the US after his conviction and sentence, and likely not permitted to re-enter the US for some time, even forever. And never been allowed his dual citizenship.

Whats clear is we should have done masks for everyone no if ands or buts until this ends. Everything else has been ineffective at best and much worse in many cases. They can only lie about this stuff so many times before its obvious we only got a tiny part of the truth. Fact is it mostly effected the obese and the elderly.

If I recall correctly I think a major reason behind Churchill‚Äôs ‚Äúwe will fight them on the beaches‚Äù speech was to assure allies that even if the nazis took over great britain, they would take their navy and scoot it all over to newfoundland or something rather than hand it over to the germans (which is what the vichy french would go on to do.)

It cannot be understated that at the outbreak of WWII, the IJN and RN (japanese and british navies) were basically peers with the US navy, and how devastating it would have been for the allies if the british surrendered to the germans like the french did or even just sued for peace and stayed out of the war. The germans would have had access to resources and raw materials that could sustain the war effort and likely would have not felt pressed to invade the USSR in an attempt to grab oil and wheat fields. At that point, the war would have been pretty much won in Europe.

On the other hand, if the Pearl Harbor attack had reached its strategic aims and actually destroyed US aircraft carriers and logistics, Japan would have had free reign over the pacific.

For the allies, being able access and maintain supply lines to an entire continent out of reach of their enemies (something the germans and Japanese tried to also take for themselves in invading the USSR and China/SEA respectively) was ultimately the deciding factor in the outcome of the war. While the axis had early military successes, they could not keep their war machine going the same way that factories in the US and USSR could once it became a war of attrition, and particularly the more planes and fuel they could make the more they could destroy axis industrial capacity, and it became unwinnable for them at that point. While I hesitate to give all the credit to a single event or person, Churchill‚Äôs speech denied them the option of cashing in while they were still on top and while many in the UK were seriously considering tapping out of the war.

To really underscore the point of how important all this was, I‚Äôd like to point this out: It‚Äôs one thing to recognize the unsurprising fact that the US was number 1 at the end of the war, but another to point out that by the end of the war, Canada, a country with 8% of the population of the US, had the 4th largest navy in the world, after the US, UK, and USSR, and Canadian factories had built more trucks than the axis powers combined.",1647711692.0,1

The movie portrays a bunch of racist stereotypes, but because they're done inaccurately, it's fine? It's purported be be clever because, insofar as it makes the audience laugh at inaccurate stereotypes, it proves that the audience is ignorant. But it still portrays those stereotypes, popularizing and affirming them for millions who saw the film. However clever you may think it is doesn't erase that.

[This isn't exactly a rare take](https://slate.com/culture/2018/07/rewatching-sacha-baron-cohens-borat-in-the-era-of-who-is-america-and-trump.html), and Cohen has been [criticised for punching down in his work pretty often](https://www.google.com/search?q=punching+down+cohen+movie&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS987US987&oq=punching+down+cohen+movie&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160i395.2634j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). I think it says a lot that Kazakhs pretty universally hate the film and its legacy. Frankly, that the discourse extends much beyond that begs the question why Americans are so keen to correct Kazakhs on what they should find racially insensitive.

I think it's also notable that the second movie made pretty much no impact. Yes, times have changed -- 
 mockumentaries are played out, and prank channels are a dime a dozen. But moviegoers aren't quite as excited to watch a racist middle eastern stereotype twenty years after 9/11, either.
