If the vowel in front of the ss makes a long sound while speaking, you still write it with √ü.

That always seemed like the most sane way to deal with it for me; it is genuinely a weird double-standard (and actively a bad practice - discipline has to come from all parents or it doesn't work).

I have possible solution you could try that... might work?(all schools and districts are their own feifdoms)

Often you do have some control over what is in the system (possibly with access online), so you could try and just add your husband and remove yourself - and make him aware of the situation so he doesn't give your number out again.

If there isn't an online system you can access to do it yourself, try contacting whomever does attendance - as they often have access to the system (or will know whomever has access) and can change it for you.

No, my wife is dead tired because motherhood. I asked if they could just check no one is in the women's  and the hold the door while I change him, but nope.

Hypocrisy isn't just inconsistency or changing your mind. It's *great* if you change your mind in the face of new evidence. That's admirable.

Hypocrisy is preaching that something's morally wrong while secretly indulging in it actively. A classic example would be a preacher calling homosexuality a sin by day while paying for male prostitutes every night. 

The tu quoque fallacy isn't any use of hypocrisy as an insult. It's an *appeal* to hypocrisy in an argument. ""You're a hypocrite, therefore your position in the argument is wrong."" A person can be right and still be a hypocrite.

George W Bush criticized Putin for invading Ukraine. Putin could reasonably reply ""well, you invaded Iraq, so you're a hypocrite."" In this case, Putin would be correct that Bush's actions were also worth condemning. However, the argument wouldn't have any bearing on whether it was wrong for Putin to invade Ukraine. The invasion can still be wrong, whether or not Bush is a hypocrite. *That's* the tu quoque fallacy.",1647441158.0,6

I may have had terrible choices when it came to women and relationships,  but I was the primary caregiver because I was disabled at home. 

I changed 90% of the diapers, took him to his Dr. Appointments, and when his Autism showed up at 3 I was the one that took him every Friday to his therapy when his mom didn't think he needed help. 

I was the one who taught him how I managed my similar Autism quirks. He was a year ahead in school and even went to a fancy Engineering focused Middle School and one year in that High School. 

Even with all that, I still couldn't hope to win custody. Then she had to leave the state, and I could only watch him go away. 

I ended up moving to the same apartment complex in order to keep in touch with my son. Now I'm teaching him to drive and do all the things I did before. His mom finally understood he had Autism when I had to come over because he had a meltdown. He also has a group of High School friends and a girlfriend. Two things I never had when I was his age.

Even with all I do, and will continue to do, I am just a background occasional thought. I am a Dad like my own Dad. Quiet, in the background, just doing the work because being a Dad isn't something you do for glory. 

Civilizations grow by building on what came before through cooperation. I always felt that the purpose of a Dad is to help your kids reach ever higher. Sadly it seems that previous generations forgot that.

As a German here on reddit, I am often baffled how backwards the US are in some aspects (probably not everywhere, but there are so many stories on reddit about women being left alone with childcare it blows my mind). Here I rarely see places where changing tables are in the women's room anymore. I would never question that a guy out with a kid was the father. Where I work, men take more time off for childcare than their wives. All of my male friends with kids value the time caring for their kids a lot.

Very few people believe women can‚Äôt be raped, even if they think rape is ok because women deserve it for being women, they‚Äôd still accept that the woman might not want it.  

With men, the issue is not the question ‚Äòwhat did they do to deserve it?‚Äô because that assumes that we accept ‚Äòit‚Äô happened.   

There are lots of people simply who don‚Äôt believe women can rape or abuse men, full stop.   Our society says men always want sex and are always physically and mentally stronger than women.

out of our parents‚Äô house and became roommates. 

I always knew girls found him attractive, but witnessing the ridiculous ease he had at getting laid was a total shock and changed my life. We would go to parties and over the next week or two, he‚Äôd have one then sometimes a second random girl from the party come over to sleep with him. It was honestly comical. I‚Äôd come home or wake up on a Saturday morning, and a girl I‚Äôd remember from a party the week prior would walk out of his room. 

After a few weeks of this pattern just impossibly repeating itself I just asked him wtf was going on, and he was honestly unsure. So I started watching how people reacted, and could see that girls were into him instantly when he walked into a room. Instantly, before even speaking to him. So yeah, it‚Äôs of course not porn-level easy and quick but it was basically the same‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd walk in, talk around, take a couple numbers (half the time it was the girls coming up to him), text them at the end of the night or soon after, and they would hook up.

Since that moment I‚Äôve been working out 4 to 5 times a week to get and stay in excellent shape, and the effect that losing the weight has had in my life is hard to overstate. I‚Äôm not as good looking as he is so it‚Äôs nowhere near as easy, but I went from having limited interest from anyone to pretty solid success. Crazy.

We talked about taking a break and about breaking things off completely, but we still loved each other and didn't want to give up. Finally she said she couldn't do it anymore and that hurt like a sonofabitch. A few weeks later though and we started talking more, then before I knew it we were actually hanging out more than we did when we were in the relationship. Then she got another boyfriend and we still hung out, but it hurt...until it didn't really hurt anymore.

We're still really cool and I think I needed that relationship at that time, but if we hadn't broken up I don't think things would have ended well. She's been with the same guy for over 10 years now.

If you wake up to have an extra hour to go to your favorite hiking spot, pick up an old hobby, make a breakfast you love, see someone, you‚Äôre going to want to do it.

Don‚Äôt set an alarm.  I am a firm believer in letting your body get as much rest as it needs whenever possible.  If you need to set an alarm due to work or whatnot, then work on going to bed earlier.  Obviously set one as a backup, but make it so that you wake up naturally an hour early.  An hour of being up early that you pay for with a headache, exhaustion, and shitty feeling is not worth an hour of extra sleep.

Don‚Äôt look at your phone.  Just don‚Äôt.  I know you want to, but don‚Äôt.  Throw it across the room if you start to open up apps.  You say five minutes but that will turn into thirty or more.  Don‚Äôt let yourself look at your phone until a certain time.

Do something that wakes you up, but don‚Äôt spend all your energy on it.  Have a quick shower if it wakes you up, but don‚Äôt shave your entire body, do an entire face routine, yada yada because then you‚Äôll have spent all your energy and want to sleep again.

This way you are in control of the pressure and gain increased control over the balls position. It might feel good to go full hog on the pressure and just lay with all your weight on the ball, but believe me, control is your friend.

&#x200B;

Edit: Use the sock to lower or hoist the ball up, and try to keep pressure to where it feels good an painful at the same time. Generally don't go for a painful feeling that later gives away to a pleasurable feeling, but instead give your body time to react and increase pressure incrementally.",1647417968.0,1351

Pushing per out can lead to incontinence later in life.


Your bladder isn‚Äôt like a rigid pipe that fills up and then empties completely, imagine it more like a wine bag with kinks and folds, so urine can be trapped in crevices.

Apparently your bladder is never 100% empty anyway.


Just pee normally without pushing, if you are sitting down on the toilet and think you‚Äôve finished peeing , then lean as far, far forward as you can, then back upright and as straight as you can. Don‚Äôt push at any stage of this.


Moving around often allows a surprising amount of extra urine to come out‚Ä¶ without pushing.


Your pelvic floor muscles keep urine from leaking out, and then need to relax to release the urine.If you push against them when they are doing their job keeping things in, you can seriously weaken them and you will pay for this when you are older.

I‚Äôm avoiding the possibility of adult nappies (diapers) later in life like the plague.

One day you may find yourself outside or looking out a window to see an extremely bright flash. As bright as if you were staring straight at the sun. Do not attempt to locate the source of the flash. You have maybe 8-10 seconds to respond if you‚Äôre far enough away from the fireball. Lay face down on the ground and put your thumbs in your ears and fingers over your eyes. Breathe through your teeth. Since you‚Äôre laying face down the shockwave will mostly pass over you. (If you‚Äôre standing up it can cause your lungs, eardrums, and other organs to explode.) Once the shockwave passes over you, you need to find shelter immediately. I said before that most death from the explosion is caused by the shockwave. Well, FAR more death is subsequently caused by nuclear fallout AFTER the blast. Do not attempt to travel anywhere. Just get underground. If you‚Äôre next to a complete stranger‚Äôs house or a business, don‚Äôt hesitate to go inside and hide out under as much concrete and steel as possible. You need to remain in this location for the next 48 hours. This is critical.

Another few tips.

Learn the signs of suicidal ideation. Sudden professions of love, someone who is typically sad suddenly happy and content (they did not miraculously get better, they made a decision and are relieved.), and giving away posessions.

Learn CPR. Courses are cheap, short, and might save a life one day (most likely a friend or family member.) Early CPR is the bomb dot com.

Swallow your pride and get checked out if something is wrong or its time to, even if it means getting your butthole/privates looked at.

Do not run away from bears. Look big and yell obscenities at them until they become offended and leave, or ragdoll onto the ground.

Tiger attacks can be avoided by making eye contact with the tiger. If it knows you know its there, it can no longer ambush you.

Drink water. If you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated.

Keep winter clothes and ability to produce heat in an emergency handy, even if you do not live in usually cold environments.

Teach yourself how to fish, hunt, forage, or otherwise survive in a wilderness scenario. 

Always tell someone your itinerary, where you will be, when you will return, and who you are going with. Tell multiple people.

Window breaker, seat belt cutter, flashlight, fire extinguisher, first aid kit, and flare gun in car.

If you have to stop on a highway, avoid getting out on your side and avoid standing between vehicles.

Do not simply wrap bleeding (gunshot) wounds with a bandage, shove gauze into the hole as tightly as you can. (Unless its a chest wound. In that case use a nonporous film (Plastic bag) to cover the hole.)

I could go on.

EDIT: Alright, a few more.

As mentioned by a comment, the recovery position is on the left side. 

Shark attacks can be helped any number of ways. My favorite is to stay out of the water. If that's not your speed, a punch to its eyes, gills, or nose can prompt it to release you if you were unfortunate enough to be chomped.

Drive undistracted and go the speed limit. We were all taught this as kids, but it is so important. Speeding drivers save, on average, 2 minutes _a week_. The key to being early is leaving early. The average time lost by people who die in motor vehicle collisions is their entire lives.

Starter fluid may just get your car to turn over long enough to get to a shop. Otherwise, keep a small portion of squirreled away money.

Bear mace can be used against people. It is far more potent, sprays further, and sprays more onto would-be attackers. Ive seen it stop people dead in their tracks. 

(I prefer firearms, but I know not everyone does. Point is: Personal protection is important.)

Do not hesitate to recognize the signs of a stroke and call 911 immediately. FAST scale is a favorite of mine.

Face droops on one side.
Arm weakness/drift.
Speech is slurred.
Time is critical.

There are other scales but this one is the simplest.

-If you encounter an animal that looks like it‚Äôs ready to stand its ground, do not run and do not turn your back. Doing so will likely provoke them further. No, you can‚Äôt fistfight a moose. 

-If you‚Äôre ever pursued by bees/wasps, run like hell! They don‚Äôt chase you particularly far (save for killer bees) and you will likely get away with minimal stings. Don‚Äôt go into water. They‚Äôre not stupid, they will wait for you to poke your fleshy bits above the water to breathe, and you will be attacked.

-Snakes, Spiders, Scorpions. If you‚Äôre bit/stung, it may be a good idea to try and capture the animal so that it can be identified. However, only do so if you‚Äôre 100% certain that you can capture the animal quickly without further endangering yourself. Getting bit by a cobra is bad, getting bit by a cobra three times because you think you need to catch it is *REALLY* bad. Focus on getting your ass to a hospital and if you can, keep an idea of what the animal looked like. Most hospitals are stocked with anti venom for local species, and most species are distinct enough for a description to work as an identifier. 

-Bats. If you get bit by a bat, or even have cause to *believe* you were bit by a bat, immediately get a rabies series. Bats are frequent carriers, and rabies is 100% lethal if it becomes symptomatic.

-Currents. If you‚Äôre trapped in any sort of current, be it a river or the sea, do not fight it. You will tire yourself out, and you will die. You will never win against water. Instead, swim perpendicular to the current. 

-Wild animals, primarily large ones. If you bump into one and it tries to back you off, get the hell away. See tip #1 for what not to do. If you get the hell away and it sticks around, stay vigilant and leave the area immediately. It‚Äôs likely a predator doing this, and it‚Äôs stalking you. It sees you as food, and wants you dead.

You use an EpiPen for anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction. Symptoms include swelling of the mouth/throat, wheezing, loss of consciousness, rash, fast pulse ect. 

The person should be carrying two epipens if they are diagnosed. If you suspect anaphylaxis, get an EpiPen and take the blue cap off. The orange bottom holds the needle. 

Get them to lie down ideally, and keep them calm. Hold it about 4 inches about the thigh (halfway between the person's bottom and their knee, and halfway between the seam of their trousers/sigh of the thigh, and the top of the thigh) and stab in fast. Do not allow it to rebound. Hold it for about 10 seconds (it says 3 on the packaging but you are better safe than sorry) , then massage area where you injected. 

Call ambulance as soon as possible and tell them ""anaphylaxis"". Keep the EpiPen for the paramedics so they can see how much adrenaline they've had. 

If symptoms don't improve after 5-10min, and there is no ambulance, you can use a second EpiPen.

Switch people as often as needed to keep the proper 2.5 ‚Äú(approx. depth so it‚Äôs easy to remember for this thread). Hard and fast. Harder than you think. Imagine the heart having to fill in that .5 second, then allow for full recoil, again imagine the heart needing to fill all the way back up. No rescue breaths needed (it‚Äôs not really safe for something that‚Äôs not needed at that time) Our blood has enough O2 in it to sustain us if the proper compressions are done. That ensures the blood will circulate to the vital organs and the oxygen in the blood is enough until EMS shows up on scene.

If you feel ribs being damaged and are still at the right depth don't stop. Living with broken ribs is better than death. Rescue breaths should be a slow 6 seconds each then back to pumping.

I will add that not all seizures look like they do in the movies with dramatic shaking and convulsing w/ unconsciousness. I witnessed one and didn't realize it as I had only ever seen tonic-clonic (the typical kind). Unfortunately, the doctor also didn't provide this information while at the hospital, which would have been very helpful in identifying what had happened. I was told by the doctor that unless blood testing can be almost immediately done, it is hard to confirm whether or not someone experienced a seizure. I'm not sure if this is true, but I certainly wish I had this information at the time because now I have no doubt that I witnessed a tonic seizure due to the description and delirium after the episode was over. 

Seizures can be even just half a minute long and sometimes look like a dramatic stiffening of the limbs (tonic seizure), a sudden loss of muscle control (atonic seizure), or a sudden jerking of the limbs without loss of consciousness (myoclonic seizure).

Do not be a hero when trying to rescue a drowning person. A person truly trained in rescue knows that if you don't need to get into the water, then don't. Throw a flotation device to them, and if conditions aren't favourable (rough currents, murky water, submerged and/or sharp objects like rocks), and/or you yourself are not a good swimmer, please do not attempt in water rescue. Call emergency services or the aid of a professional life guard (if one around). And if you absolutely, must get into the water? For god sake take something large and floating with you so you can shove it in the person's face so they can grab that, and not you. And if they do go to grab you? Kick away, and keep kicking away until they either tire out or grab the flotation aid. Do not become a victim yourself.

car glass is *designed* to not shatter or break with the explicit purpose to contain the passenger in case of crash.


Car head rests are just as impossible to use as anything else you might find on your car. Not even a hammer will help you.


get a special breaking device (costs a dollar) if this is a concern.

heck, get a piece of a spark plug if you are so cheap.. it will work 100x better (i.e. at all) at breaking your car window:

Make sure you pull off any active road or highway to as safe of a position as you possibly can.  If you are on an active highway and cannot pull off to a safe zone, pull over as far to the right (or left) of the highway as you can, put on your hazard lights, and call for road assistance or even a local police.  Most people don‚Äôt realize, but almost every police officer, highway patrolman, etc. has all the necessary tools needed to help assist with a tire change.  Furthermore, calling the police for assistance helps create visibility to your situation and may help other motorists from getting too close to someone changing a tire.  DO NOT try changing a tire on a busy highway with little to no visibility (be it weather related, road or scenery related).  Additionally, when positioning your car for a tire change, make sure your car is on as level of position as possible.

Writing time is for the doctors, not us. We will never ever remove a tourniquet. That stays on untill the doctors remove it at the hospital.

Tourniquets can stay on for approximately 2 hours before any serious harm is done to the limb. If its on for an extended period of time, 2+hrs, the limb will begin to die, progressing as time goes on. Regardless of that, the alternative of taking off the tourniquet is worse. 

Oh, and tourniquets hurt like a bitch. Its not like the movies, their use is very unpleasant. Be prepared for the person youre helping to fight you. Especially watch out for a punch to the face. You cannot help anyone if you become injured yourself. No matter how much they fight, beg you to stop, or scream in agony, you do NOT stop tightening until the bloodflow stops.

The material is also of the utmost importance. Do NOT use improvised cord or factory cord based tourniquets. It needs to be flat, and wide. Think like a belt, or just google a professional tourniquet. If you use narrow material like a cord, itll cut into the flesh and cause all sorts of trauma such as nerve damage.

One last tidbit, when it comes to bleeds. A deep dark crimson blood that absolutely pours out is veinous, a bright red spurting is arterial. If youre just seeing a lot of oozing, start by trying hard direct pressure with a bandage. Only if that fails after giving it a dang good try, should you use a tourniquet. If its not pouring, or spurting, it should be controllable with pressure. 

Fun fact. A tourniquet to the neck will stop 100% of bleeding, 100% of the time ;) /s",1647416644.0,25

If you get knocked unconscious in the fall, your car may end up under water but it‚Äôs usually pretty slow to completely fill the cabin. Stay calm. Get your seatbelt off, take a deep breath and break that window. Keep your face turned away from the window. The pressure of the water will likely blow the glass inside and all the air will rush out.

Together we can take it to the end of the line.

We relate tho, my mother was also abusive. I remember the music video for "" Faint"" came on MTV when I was watching it and after it ended, I couldn't wait for it to come back on. I snatched up Hybrid Theory and rocked out. I was 8 then... 

Fast-forward, a month before my 12th birthday, my father wound up getting custody of me from my abusive mother and you would think "" fuck, finally it's done and over with"" but then my emotional problems really took off, I had started cutting and severely depressed and suicidal. By then, I had gotten all the L.P CDs that had come out and I would just blast them over and over, ruminating in my depression, soaking up the words I couldn't find. Feeling rage, sorrow, numbness, and comfort because I felt like someone else knew what I was going through.
I am 30 now, and I still struggle with deperession  anxiety, and ptsd. I also still listen to linkin park pretty much almost daily.

Chester actually helped me get help. I would quote lyrics and his interviews with depression to tell mental health professionals what my symptoms felt like. I have little weird Linkin Park coincidences  too. When I was in the hospital for depression in 2018, someone had a stack of CDs and DVDs and they had an L.P music documentary, and it was put on on the hospital t.v and I felt comfort. Same year prior to the hospital visit, I had became homeless and I was eating at the soup kitchen one evening, and also, same thing, some dude had a stack of C.Ds and just so happen to have Linkin Park and he put it on the outdated CD player and the whole soup kitchen listened to L.P. Maybe I'm grabbing at straws, but it's my way of thinking that Chester is always with me.

Yes I agree, his death was a hard pill to swallow. I feel the same way you do. I feel like when the world lost Chester, I lost one of my best friends who I vented all my emotions to. It especially hit me hard cause of how he went. I wish I could of saved Chester like he saved me.

I now kind of see him as a guardian angel of sorts, but not just for me, but for his family, friends and fans as well. 
Chester was big on connection, and I'm sure he would want us to connect through his music and help each other.

His legacy is forever and I will never stop screaming along.

Who cares if one more light goes out ? 
We do.

As service winded down and there were only a few tickets hanging he returned to the kitchen again and visited each station and chatted with the people working those stations. He talked about what they were making, where they have been, and where they were planning on going. Afterward, he posed for staff pictures and teased our chef to the delight of all the cooks.

It served BBQ. I never went before or after (I was in college and couldn't be afford to eat out a lot, but I loved to punish myself by reading menus, haha) but they kept the changes (except getting rid of the sandwiches like Irvine suggested) and it still ended up closing.

 I honestly don't know why he picked that place. It was in a small rural town and, like Irvine seems to do a lot, the prices went up a lot and the menu got smaller. That might be fine in a bigger town or a large city, but people in this rural area don't make the money to support a business like that. Plus, it was in a state where there are BBQ places everywhere so patrons could go down the road and get more variety for cheaper.

Robert Irvine sent a team of designers in, and they did a great job. The changes to the dining area look fantastic. He also made a couple menu suggestions that have been very popular. Those aspects are real, and the RI team deserves a lot of credit.

But the drama was mostly fake. The restaurant was struggling because covid lockdowns hit most restaurants hard. Now that restrictions are mostly lifted, they need customers not marital advice. But that's not what reality shows are selling. They invented this whole scenario where the chef is a micro-managing asshole and his wife is about to leave him. Robert has a heart-to-heart therapy session with the chef and everything magically changes. Totally scripted.

At one point the camera crew arrived as they were preparing for the dinner service. One of the line cooks was apparently pretty hung over, and the rest of the kitchen team (including the owner/chef) were laughing and giving the guy a hard time.

Just because you've seen a lot of shows that aren't real doesn't mean you can call everything fake without the slightest hint of it being so. It's unfair towards the creator of a show that isn't actually scripted but is seen as such because the general public judges things on a bunch of _core truths_ they learned as a child and have never questioned or researched in their whole life.

These vary on the country you grew up in of course, but a few examples from my region are:

- Everything on TV is fake
- McDonalds is the epitome of low quality food
- Google is a disgusting company and the most untrustworthy in terms of privacy

Now, I'm not saying these aren't true (or false), but it annoys me that people just hear these things from some relative and repeat them to anyone they meet without taking a single second to check it first.

In my country McDonald's has made big efforts to improve on the quality of their meat and other ingredients sourcing them from local farms, yet a Boomer will still laugh in your face if you tell them that even though it's certain that they have never in their life read about the conditions at McDonald's (before or now). They are in no position to make that call, yet they feel so superior while doing it.

Anyway, sorry for the rant. Kitchen Nightmares isn't necessarily fake (or real), so give them the benefit of the doubt and you'll enjoy it more.

Guy Fieri flew in wearing a parachute with the American flag on it and tried to high-five a blonde woman, but missed and slapped her across the face so hard her grandmother had to sign a release form.

She thanked him and left as the waiters brought out a flight of various Monte Cristo sandwiches from places around town. Guy had them cut each in half before eating them so that he could tell his dietician he was literally cutting calories, though he did eat both halves.

Afterward, he and the production staff smoked pipe tobacco while sitting around a chiminea. This was actually nice, but a little strange since they were filming in the abandoned lot between our town's Kmart and Sears. He then attached a fan to his parachute so it could become a paraglider and lifted off, flying back to where his plane had been circling overhead all afternoon so he could make it to the next fimling location.",1647437420.0,1

However, these threads have popped up before and the usual response is that Ramsay provides the owner a list of changes that could help (there are no guarantees). In most cases the owners just don't bother with any of them mainly because they're too arrogant or stubborn to accept that what they're doing already is wrong. The only reason they went on the show was for the advertising.



You see this quite a bit on the show. The owner is usually the root cause of all the problems. They just can't accept their food is bad, their service is bad, the location is bad, their food safety is bad. They just figured they could open a restaurant and it would print money.",1647445461.0,1

I woke up this morning with a bad hangover

And my penis was missing again.

This happens all the time.

It's detachable.

This comes in handy a lot of the time.

I can leave it home, when I think it's gonna get me in trouble,

Or I can rent it out, when I don't need it.

But now and then I go to a party, get drunk,

And the next morning I can't for the life of me

Remember what I did with it.

First I looked around my apartment, and I couldn't find it.

So I called up the place where the party was,

They hadn't seen it either.

I asked them to check the medicine cabinet

'Cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes

But not this time.

So I told them if it pops up to let me know.

I called a few people who were at the party,

But they were no help either.

I was starting to get desperate.

I really don't like being without my penis for too long.

It makes me feel like less of a man,

And I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak.

After a few hours of searching the house,

And calling everyone I could think of,

I was starting to get very depressed,

So I went to the Kiev, and ate breakfast.

Then, as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark's Place,

Where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street,

I saw my penis lying on a blanket

Next to a broken toaster oven.

Some guy was selling it.

I had to buy it off him.

He wanted twenty-two bucks, but I talked him down to seventeen.

I took it home, washed it off,

And put it back on. I was happy again. Complete.

People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached,

But I don't know.

Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass,

I like having a detachable penis.

By acting as if he's in a hurry and talking quickly, he eliminates the opportunity for Franklin to counterattack, meaning that he can continue delivering his verbal abuse. The use of the phrase ""yee-yee"" is especially clever as it has very loose meanings and is utilised to further demean Franklin while not being necessarily rude, as well as fitting nicely into the rhythm of Lamar's ""smack-talk"" as they call it. Since a person's hair is usually one of their most stand-out and noticeable features, by ridiculing his, Lamar makes Franklin's identity feel attacked and being shorter means that he's opened to the perspective of one taller than himself having to look down at it, making him especially self-conscious. Furthermore, by berating Franklin's female partner, Lamar starts to get very personal with him which makes the insults even harsher, while also making Franklin feel inadequate in romantic relationships. As well as this, feigning uncertainty of her secret partner's occupation and referring to contemporarily intelligent and respectable vocations such as ""lawyer"" and ""brain surgeon"" Lamar attacks Franklin's lack of a formal education and business smarts. Finally, the strange and belittling way he says ""nneEegaahh"" further aims to make Franklin seems foolish and by slightly squatting to make eye contact, Lamar subtly roasts Franklin's stature again, as well as his status, making him feel like an insignificant child.

your own words state that in at least one instance, your problem with the boss was that you were *not* learning the attack patterns and when to roll. that's the core concept of the entire game's combat system, and you must be good at that to play the game. If you're good *enough* at that task you don't need strategies for individual bosses, you simply learn their attack patterns and then the attacks don't touch you because you're rolling.

Yes, ultimately, if you want to declare that it's an insult towards you instead of genuine advice, you can say ""that only says 'git gud' in more words"".

Yes, we are just helping them learn to do so, as they are struggling to do so on their own.

No, they are still learning to play the game, we are just helping them do so. That's the whole point, give advice to help them learn. We're not taking the controller out of their hands and playing for them.

Asking for help is not whining.

>You learn the attacks and then you learn to avoid them and then you learn to fight back while not dying. That IS the game. The whole point and core concept.

And they're struggling to develop the necessary stills and tools to do so, so we give them advice to help them along with that development.

They do want to learn, they just don't know how, so they ask for help.

Just because they're not solving everything completely independently doesn't mean they're not playing the game. If fact, the game has a built in way for players to give each other guidance and advice. ""Try horseback battle,"" ""watch out for left,"" etc. Does getting warned you're going to be ambushed suddenly mean you're not playing the game anymore since you didn't walk into it and figure it out for yourself? Of course not. Some players need more help then others, but that doesn't invalidate their playing experience or mean that they're choosing not to play the game.

I think you make yourself mad. I don't ever said and thought that. What I  said is there is no good advice you can give to a player that is 100% satisfactory since the souls games rely on enemy patterns as the difficulty. And learning them is the most effective way to be better. 

Gear is secondary or even not that important imo.

This is why no leveling challenges are possible too",1647435869.0,-2

It was such a cool movie! For a kid... I've read other reviews of the movie and it was mixed. Sounding kind of like the movie sucked and what not. I honestly don't remember how everything went, only bits and pieces, but I really want to watch the movie now as an adult! Hahaha I haven't seen it in maybe two decades? üò±ü§∑

I remember parts of it and maybe just really liked it cause I was a kid at the time and didn't really pay attention to things like story, character development, or other bts things to be aware of.

Nonetheless, I still think the actresses portrayal of the character was great from my memory. I mean, aside from being able to do some of her action moves; I remember liking the acting. The storyline must've been good too. How accurate to the game? I'm not sure, as fas lore goes. But entertaining for any fan of Street Fighter and 80/90's movies.",1647425805.0,2

The portrayals, and the closeness of the characters looks rang true to me. I will not ever rule this movie out as my fave version. However; the assassin fist movie was more accurate to story than anything I‚Äôve seen and love it just as much. Ryu, ken, and akuma were so character accurate and physically accurate it was scary.

Anyone playing Atari games and stuff were pretty wowed by future generations. I think that went for most early consoles. Games continually got better, and interest in them grew vastly over the years. It was a pretty steady stream of innovation and awe.  


Then we hit the point when the big name companies started diluting what once was more focused, unique, and challenging experiences to reach wider audiences. And around the same time they began exploring other avenues of gaining revenue, creating less and less complete products. Now we don't only get products with less content, but perpetually they launch in unfinished states, sometimes seemingly with a mentality of 'we'll fix it if it sells well enough'.  


I can very much still recognize and praise achievements of todays modern game. I don't have any issues with kids liking fortnite for the gameplay, or community, or even the type of content Epic provides therein. They have a commendable hustle going on. Rather, my distaste with many modern releases, and my general fear, is that they will even further enforce and normalize predatory and addicting revenue practices that are essentially never ending money pits for bite sized snippits of content that should have been in the base product, and because 'that's what we grew up with' the fight against these practices could essentially end with the people who grew up before that was 'just the way things work'.",1647392710.0,46

Everyone was excited about the new games/ consoles as well as their leaps in graphics technology and story- telling/ immersion. By the time 3D graphics became the norm, people were all in.

Now that technology has pretty much plateaued, people look for every little thing to complain about because well, there's a LOT of competition out there and they're making amazing stuff. There was a huge push for ""a widening of general audience approval"" across basically all forms of media, in an attempt to make the most money possible out of IPs such as Marvel and Star Wars, (TV as well, Big Bang Theory, basically any sitcom now, etc..) The idea that certain creative choices will have to be made in order to appeal to people who have never consumed that type of content before or something similar (which is why so much stuff on TV and in movies feels shallow or uninspired). Well, after many billions of dollars were made doing this, it didn't take long for the most successful video game companies in the world to start doing the same. 

Remember, most of these companies started out with and abundance of creatives who were most concerned with quality of content over how much money could be made. Most of these creatives have long since retired or have taken senior roles in the company and are making too much money to care, leaving their spaces open for more ""business minded"" and ""money minded"" individuals to come in and eventually either overpopulate the company with non creatives, or push the company so far down a money making path/ scheme that there's no chance to flex creative muscles outside of creating an ""interesting premise"". These companies hire huge groups of developers from all sorts of backgrounds thinking they're paying top dollar for quality, but then are putting non creatives in charge of driving and maintaining the ship, meaning any creative idea that sounds like a gamble that could potentially hurt the bottom line gets squashed and replaced with an idea that's more ""appropriate and acceptable for general audiences"". Creatives ultimately have no say because the funding for the project comes from this company and in many cases is the only chance most of these games ever had of being made, so they either toe the company line or leave. 

THIS is why games are delayed all the time as well as why huge names in the industry are stepping down or outright quitting projects left and right. Constant lack of creative direction because the higher ups force their hands on the game the creatives are trying to make (adding micro transactions, story changes to make it more ""acceptable to general audiences"", live service games/ adaptations of existing cash cows, etc.) THIS is why people who have lived long enough to see the decline in quality, complain about it.",1647426646.0,2

To take the comic examples; minecraft got criticized because people said ""it's not a game - it's a sandbox"". But I don't think anyone hated it. I believe it also got criticized because of the ridiculous youtube streams of it where creepy adults would appeal to a child market.

Fortnight got criticized because of similar things, streams that appeal to children, exploitative practices, monetization, basically designing the game around an addictive grind.

My problem with Fortnite, is that it is one of the worst offenders of predatory microtransactions. Microtransactions are scummy at the best of times, but given that this game is clearly targeted towards the younger generation, that's next level scuminess. There is nothing wrong with targeting games to certain demographics, and there's nothing new about it either. Is it a kids game? Not really any more than pretty much any other game out there. It's just like there aren't ""girls games"" and ""boys games"".

Fortnite is not the only game that is predatorily targeted towards children, but it is certainly the most prominent example.

If microtransations went away tomorrow, that would be frankly to the benefit of everyone, but microtransactions don't impact the fundamental gameplay of the game, so at the core, it's a great game (probably.

They literally force themselves to hate a game just because it has microtransactions, no matter if they find it fun or not. 






90% of their arguments are based on nostalgia delusion, pretending that old games didn't have bugs that were never fixed, pretending that old games didn't copy paste, pretending that old games didn't rely heavily on DLCs and expansion packs for monetization, pretending that old games didn't cost the same price as the new ones while giving less content, and then out of nowhere they become software engineers and explain how Rockstar is totally able to release GTA 6 within 2 years of their previous game but they don't want to because GTA V is too much of a cash cow, and their evidence is the fact that they released 2 absurdly small GTA games within 2 years at some point of time...

However, gaming innovation (at least in the triple A space) has slowed, I think. Not in terms of production and story but more in the types of games which get made and how often we see entirely new styles and genres. I don't think that is due to any nefarious intentions. These titles have become more expensive than they've ever been, and there is a business need to manage risk which often results to catering to the lowest common denominator and chasing whatever gaming trend seems to be gaining popularity.

That said, the gaming business model has just become worse over time. I understand the need to fund games and how base price has barely moved in years, but the normalizing of aggressive monetization is disheartening. I remember when an expansion for a game was something to be excited about, maybe a one time massive improvement on content available in the base game, usually something like 50-60% the cost of the original. Now we have tons of predatory free to play games, and now even full price triple A games, which push these ""micro""-transactions which can cost as much as a full game. It's not like the business was ever particularly benevolent. The arcade scene existed to extract quarters, after all. 

So when I see the popularity of something like Fortnite, I think my old man jaded perspective is to ignore the gameplay and see the decline of gaming over time in its ridiculous monetization. Maybe it's a fine game and people who play it don't care. I expect we see this trend repeating itself and those same people are going to judge whatever new cash grab product is out in 5-10 years.

And around the same time they began exploring other avenues of gaining revenue, creating less and less complete products.

I see where you're coming from, but I wouldn't remotely say it happened ""around the same time."" From my point of view, this ""dilution to reach wider audiences"" happened sometime around the start of the 6th generation. That's about when I felt games weren't being made ""for gamers"" anymore.

But with the benefit of perspective, I think that's really just when things had changed enough that I personally started noticing it. After all, how many people now hold the 6th gen (Dreamcast/PS2/Xbox/GameCube) up as gaming's last ""golden age""?

I think the reality is, gaming has been trending toward wider accessibility since the beginning, and it's always correlated with the growth of the industry and the audience. The 8-bit kids thought 16-bit games were too easy, then those raised on 2D twitch action games often derided early 3D titles for lacking challenge, then early 3D gamers dunked on the Wii for appealing to non-gamers, and so on...

I absolutely think the industry is normalizing predatory and addicting practices with younger generations, which sucks, but the focus on expanding the audience (often at the expense of providing an experience that's going to satisfy more dedicated/experienced players) goes back much further.

Sadly, a few smaller companies (and indie devs) take it a bit too far, with graphics that would feel dated on a NES.  I think the sweet spot for low-end graphics is Genesis/SNES.  Not a total cop-out on graphics, but far far far less labor intensive than anything that woulda been released on the Playstation or later consoles.

Some of my favorite games where the graphics are ""great"", without actually being high-end:

* Slay the Spire
* Rimworld
* Don't Starve
* Factorio
* Among Us

And a bit higher tier graphics, but still below what AAA titles seem obligated to do:

* Hades
* Oxygen Not Included

Each of these games could obviously have better graphics.  But, unlike Minecraft, you don't really notice the low textures because they are just high enough to feel intentional (not minimalist/lazy/cheap).

Factorio in particular is super simplistic graphics, but it would fit right in during the SNES era (graphics wise at least).  And it absolutely works.

First just community built mods available for free (provided you owned half life or quake) run on servers provided by the community.

Now the games are maintained by people who get paid to maintain the game and servers. The biggest difference is that cost was spread through people running stuff on their free college Internet and electric.  Maybe they owned a business and was ok with running a server or two to advertise that business.

Games need to be funded somehow because not everyone wants to build something for free and then pay to run servers so people can enjoy. Many can't afford to do that.

Cosmetics seem like the best alternative to a subscription model. This includes models like the old buy the game, and then buy map packs.  Multiplayer games are expensive because of servers and continuous new content. Look at complaints about Halo infinite for not having enough maps and modes when it was a free game.

Arcade games are the biggest example of old school gaming with micro transactions.

I get where your coming from, but the market basically opposes paying for more than just core content on a multiplayer game. They refuse to buy map packs and most want matchmaking vs needing to search for a community run server.  Two decades ago was a different time when all this online gaming was still new and game companies did not keep servers on forever. They also did not run very many servers, certainly not enough to support the entire player base. So the continued cost was much lower because the community paid it.

Halo Infinite also has a terrible store model. The items for sale there are poor and not worth anywhere near what they're priced at. One cosmetic item is a grenade that your character wears on their belt, its shaped like a pineapple, it's $10.",1647428473.0,2

Fortnite doesn't get bashed because kids like it. It got bashed because those people tried it, found massive flaws with the product. Kids enter into the equation by still liking it DESPITE the flaws, and them not knowing better.
The complaint isn't that it is for kids. Tons of games that are ""for kids"" and plaid by kids don't get the same amount of flak.

Most of the skins/emotes they release aren't my thing. I'd never buy the Arianna grande skins for example, because I don't give a shit about Arianna grande...

The game is decently rewarding with its content. Each season you get 500 bucks for free as you progress + about 20% of the battle pass which includes skins, emotes, dances, etc.

The battle pass is 950 bucks, so within two seasons you can buy it for free, and once you buy it, you get everything you would have already unlocked, including all the free bucks. I think each season has something like 1500-2000 free bucks, so it gives you more than enough to buy the next session battle pass for free and have some left over for the shop.

This game isn't about getting everything that's ever been created. You can only wear a limited amount of stuff at a time, so why would you want the 1000+ skins? I personally only play with maybe 4 or 5 skins total, generally defaulting to my main one or two.

So there is a small window of kids that would know who bugs is in a recent modern style. The old cartoons still get played a lot there cheap and short. They make good bumpers. But yeah the few things bugs has been in recently have a small audience and generally arn't very eye catching to younger kids. Honestly i find more young adults enjoying modern bugs shows. They just seem to be aimed at older crowds.

As for Micky... My god theres like three new Micky shows every year basically consent new shorts. Hes in commercials and the biggest movies are all Disney and have the mouses branding all over. Even if a kid doesn't know Micky in the old sense of the shorts. They know ""The mouse"". Its impossible to escape the mouse. Disney still puts out near consent new IPs using the same 3 leads and their families. Micky, Donald, and Goofy. They are EVERYWHERE. Like hell the house of mouse STILL is a thing iv seen on reruns, the wonderful world Micky mouse for heaven sakes is brand new. Disney will not let the mouse fall out of every generation of childens brains. It would take an act of god and nuclear warfare to stop them.

Goku is a cultural phenomenon in Latin america. You would actually be more likely to find steel mill workers in say Brazil or mexico that know who goku is then in america.  Huge swaths of the world know who goku is in a weird way. Even having no idea what dragonball/Z/Super is at all. Hes also a hugely popular cheap knock off toy the world over. He kinda suffers the same problem hello kitty has. EVERY knows goku, even if they don't know his name. It also helps goku is a international mascot for japan so gets seen a lot. Much in the same way Micky gets noticed a lot from america. So heavily depending on where you are in the world hes more or less known.

Personally my problem with spider-man and batman is that everyone seems to know them as movie characters not as their actual charterers.  Which makes it hard to say if they actually are well known or if just famous actors playing them in expensive movies made them well known cause famous actors. Its hard to detach the fame of the actor from the role. Like iron man is a great example. I doubt you could find anyone nowadays who doesn't know iron man. But NO one knows who iron man is, where he came from or the actual characterization of him. They just know robert downey jr.

It is in the roundabout sense of ""kids loving it validates it as a product and design blueprint to others, including the things that one dislikes, regardless of the kids"".

My point is by blaming the dislike on the kids, you are devaluing the criticism that IS levied, not for disagreeing with it. Just as ""at the core not relevant and only a matter of superficial camoflage hiding the distaste for kids"".

This isn't nice. It's probably filmed in either Cambodia or Vietnam where sourcing this breed of monk (stub tail) is illegal (they're also endangered).  
The typical Youtube channel format is to unbox an infant that has been 'abandoned by its mother (the mother is usually poached). It's kept until either it goes out of the cute baby stage, or the authorities take it and release it into a safe jungle area, where it'll die from lack of food or be torn apart by the local troop. If it's *very* lucky, there may be a space in a local sanctuary.  

In summary; not nice, and really not the sort of content I'd like to see in this otherwise lovely sub. Non-human primates are not pets, nor can be easily kept as such.

They are listed as vunerable because of loss of habitat & hunting for food. They are illegal to have as pets in Vietnam. They can carry herpes B. At this age, this one SHOULD be out in the wild with the family unit or troop. Chances are, they killed mom as a source of food & took the baby as a pet.

They don't stay looking like Bernie Sanders either. Here's what mom & probably an older  sibling would look like.

Youre incorrect. Go read and listen to Jane Goodall. You will never find any reputable  primate scientist, researcher or caretaker with any other stance. There's really no excuse for cute videos of primates without their moms. If it's a rehab, they need to be doing education work in the videos. Its inexcusable to present primates in a way anyone could confuse for pets. No one in primatology, who cares one single whit about them would ever treat them or present them as cute for human consumption. It flies in the face of every conservation effort, of everyone working towards their welfare, and the dignity of the animals themselves. Primates are not pets and any entity that presents them as cute and cuddly are adding to the lay perception that they can be pets. Its inherently and fundamentally fucked up.",1647440482.0,1

And while it may seem odd, country is in that sub genre. So is blues, rap, and folk. Rock music, like any other genre, is not some island. They are all connected and influential to each other. Country one of the many roots of Rock and Roll, so any artist in that genre that makes an impact in the genre should be considered. 

This argument happens so often in this sub it seems like. And there have been repeatedly takes on it. People got all bent out of shape the last few years when it was hip-hop and rap artists being inducted.

I always thought Rock and Roll to be more about attitude than whatever it is everyone seems to want it to be. Sly and The Family Stone - always considered them to be a rock band. Even punk bands, I'd put them under the Rock and Roll umbrella. Prince, again Rock and Roll.

But sometime in the nineties, I think as hip hop culture really took off, we started the current subgenre phase. And frankly, IMO we started this reductive nonsense of separating styles. If anyone thinks popular/rock music isn't as good as it was before the nineties, I believe this is the reason.

But, those are not 'Rock & Roll' specific traits.  Jazz and the Blues also very much do/did those things.  Rock & Roll IS a kind of music.  Genre specific 'Hall of Fame' organizations exist.  There is a Country Music Hall of Fame and Dolly has been in that for more than 20 years.  And, that is great.  But, there is a reason why Pink Floyd is not in the Country Music Hall of Fame.  And, there is a reason why Dolly probably shouldn't be in the Rock Hall of Fame.  She is popular now for non-music related reason and so nominating her generates buzz.  And, the R&R Hall of Fame is notorious for being an organization dedicated to trying to generate cash for the people in charge.

You can‚Äôt really understand all of the other genres without understanding rock and roll and vice versa. Music, like other human endeavors, is really squishy, and takes on many iterations. ‚ÄòRock and Roll,‚Äô like America itself, has become a ‚Äòmelting pot‚Äô of all kinds of influences and traditions. It appropriates, evolves and iterates. And it has many forces shaping it. Delta blues, country, folk music from many continents, electronic music, soul, classical, jazz. You can hear those influences in many different recordings that we consider ‚Äòrock‚Äô music. Think about the many influences on the music of Elvis alone. He had an extraordinary range of influences. Country, blues, r&b, cocktail style jazz, the guitar from ‚ÄòLove Me Tender‚Äô could have easily have been lifted from a nylon string classical performer as much as a blues performer, gospel, ‚ÄòViva Las Vegas‚Äô was pretty much a salsa number. If you are a music student or someone who wants to study music from an academic or historical perspective you ask the question ‚ÄòHow did Elvis become Elvis?‚Äô  And then you really think about his music in the context of everything else going on. So from that perspective, Dolly Parton getting nominated kind of makes sense- as someone who in some ways caused a lot of rock and pop rock to ‚Äòsound‚Äô the way it does.",1647441309.0,1

Modern music audiences, especially because so much music is readily available due to streaming services and the massive music catalogs that are available to them, as well as other media that makes the perspective of the actual music creators known - seem to have a much more eclectic taste. It‚Äôs clear the Rock Hall has attempted to reflect the more eclectic musical tastes and influences of fans and creators of American music in general. 

I‚Äôm an 80‚Äôs kid- I listened to all kinds of music growing up- from the hardest metal and punk, to dance music, hip hop, Motown, classic rock, world folk music, classical, electronic music - etc. Pop music started to sound really different in the 80‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been a little sad that it‚Äôs been dominated by hip hop in the last couple of decades- not because I don‚Äôt like hip hop, I really love it and love a lot of the artists releasing music now- but that pop music has lost some of its eclectic nature- there is so much other good music out there that is not being promoted as much. I saw Gary Numan on Sunday night live in concert- and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing Sigur Ros this summer- both groups definitely could be considered ‚ÄòRock‚Äô music - structurally- but they sound so different from Chuck Berry or Elvis or Boston.

Country music sucks.  It's shitty soccer mom/dad pop.  It's safe It's contrived.  It's shitty suburbian zero lot line...  its barely one step above Christian rock which seems to be a place somewhat talented but non distinguished musicians sell their soul to the lord for fans and modest financial gain.

Bluegrass is thug as fuck.  Want to know a common blue grass trope?  Killing your fucking wife because you love her so much and she went astray.  That's some hardcore shit.  Ain't right.  But fucking hardcore.

Another gangster ass bluegrass trope:  digging fucking coal in the earth until you die.  Digging coal is to bluegrass what slangin rocks was to 90s rap.

Bluegrass is southern rural American music that has the balls to tell some fucked up yet moving stories free from what is ""appropriate"" by modern standards.

BUT... fun fact, the Coen brothers were also influenced by a long short story called 'A Dozen Tough Jobs' by Howard Waldrop.  in short, imagine the Twelve Labors of Hercules, but set in the South of the 1920s, where a convict, Houlka Lee, has  been let out of jail to work for a local heavy, Boss Eustis, who sets him a bunch of jobs which verge on impossible.  It is a complete hoot, with some darkness.  I'd love to quote some of it, but that would be spoiler stuff.  Also note one of the characters in OBWAT? is named Waldrip.

It really is worth your while to track it down, if you liked the movie.  Trust me! Try your library.  It's also included in the collection 'Night of the Cooters (More Neat Stuff)'.

(Sidenote, one of Waldrop's short stories is being turned into a short film, the aforesaid 'Cooters'.  Starring Vincent d'Onofrio and produced by GRR Martin.  Coming soon!)  Trailer:

For me, it settles into the very wide area of ""performance art"". I really don't think that Bo intended for it to be a laugh riot. I think he had bottled up a LOT of feelings for a long time, then had even more BS piled on with Covid and lockdown. This was his way of not necessarily making us laugh, but inviting us to share HIS experience of the last few years - it's a distillation of the zeitgeist, I guess, to get a little pretentious in describing it.

I didn't know anything about it when I watched it, but had seen What? and Make Happy.  It was pretty uncomfortable to watch.  Like watching someone spiralling into a nervous breakdown.  

Make Happy ends with a sing where he describes himself as a kid with declining mental health trying to make you happy, but...  It's sandwiched in silliness and also ends with him leaving the room and going out into daylight.  So the feel is less oppressive than Inside.  Also, he repeatedly tells us everything is fake, including every part of the show.  (This could be in What? but I'm thinking about knocking over the bottle of water and the book of poems with blank pages.)

Parts of Inside are really funny, but if you only watched bits on YouTube you could have an impression of it that doesn't really convey the tone of the whole show.

Equally, I think you could watch Inside expecting What? and Make Happy and finish thinking, ""What did I just watch?  That wasn't a comedy show.""",1647440568.0,1

About a 5 block walk from my house. West Allis (Milwaukee suburb) is normally considered the ""white trash"" area of MKE. In reality, it's a huge melting pot of working families. The city has been pumping in money to revitalize the downtown area and the stretch of national avenue. They even did a rebrand right before covid. New, objectively clean, logo... New website... E services... Etc.

I've lived here for almost 10 years. I'm a Kenosha native (yes that Kenosha), lived in mke for most of my 20's, and settled down with my family in West Allis. The taxes are still relatively cheap for the area and State Fair is not far from this mural.

Long story short... I used to give people shit who lived in ""Stalls"" but living here has completely changed  my attitude.

But wtf does dad have to look so pissed?!

Oh yeah, that's right.  His son will maybe get shot to death by the police (for driving, with a legal driver's license)  The father AND son both pay taxes that pay for their own executions.
A stupid, superficial injury could become life threatening because it's unaffordable.

7891,pics,[OC] I photographed this blue tit in the last light of the day.,,1647344982.0,473,29400,0.97,Phrexeus,"Not OP, but a few suggestions:

Use a longer lens or get closer. You can get away with some pretty outrageous high ISO if you're somewhere close to filling the frame. If you're cropping in a lot the noise becomes way more prominent.

Get more light on the sensor, so make sure the aperture is wide open and try dropping your shutter speed as low as you dare, then go even lower. Take pot-shots, you will get many blurry shots, but hopefully a few sharp ones. Lean on stuff to help stabilise your body and the lens. If your camera has a quiet or silent shutter use that. Hold your breath and press the shutter slowly. After a while you will do this automatically without thinking. (This all goes out the window when shooting moving subjects btw, then you generally need a high shutter speed, however most small birds often stay still for a few seconds at a time.)

Use single point continuous focus and most of the time you should aim for the eye or the edge of the eye. I'd recommend back-button focusing as well if you're not already using it.

Ideally you're shooting RAW and using lightroom or similar, dial in just enough ""colour noise reduction"" so that the coloured blotches disappear and leave luminance noise reduction at zero (really). Then add sharpening - again not too much it's easy to overdo. If you're feeling really fancy you can export to photoshop unsharpened, then resize to whatever screen resolution it will be displayed at, then duplicate layer and add unsharp mask, then add a layer mask and paint it so that *only the areas which have detail are sharpened*.",1647377919.0,5

It's not that they reject neutrality. They are rejecting a specific form of neutrality, and proposing another.

Ukraine is looking for security guarantees. They are willing to be in a one-way security assurance treaty with major powers, where Ukraine does not get involved in foreign conflict, but in exchange there is an explicit treaty that major powers (such as America, China, Russia etc.) will treat an attack on Ukraine or infringement of Ukrainian sovereignty as an act of war and immediately counterattack whoever started shit.  

Basically they want the Japan or Taiwan deal. Japan is officially neutral and does not get involved in foreign wars (for example, they were not involved in Vietnam, Korea or Afghanistan), but have a security guarantee that if someone attacks them, America will defend them, they maintain a significant military, and have training and procurement deals with friendly nations.",1647441166.0,13

8390,worldnews,Ukraine rejects Russian neutrality idea as US steps up aid,,1647435572.0,1014,15449,0.97,Dziedotdzimu,"A few clarifying points 

1. Marx thought socialism or communism was a classless, moneyless, stateless society where people freely associate and work, and all your needs are provided

2. Marx didn't think you just snap your fingers and that happens, and him and various contemporaries have arguments till this day about what the necessary steps and how you should try to do this. Importantly though marx's method meant understanding each society in its own light and avoided generalized stories of overarching phases of history that come in a specific order

3. Lenin comes around and calls the transitional steps (that Marx said aren't socialism or communism) socialism and starts working on an idea that a government autocracy can create the conditions necessary for communism to happen because he didnt read well and thought it should happen in a specific order of necessary phases of history. This is solidified in Stalin's idea of ""socialism in one country"" which by Marx's work is already an oxymoron

4. This also happens in China with Mao's great leap forward forcing industrialization etc... to create an exploited industrialized working class with the idea that he can speed run the phases.

5. None of this worked and in the modern forms you have Dengists in China saying that the government actually has to be super capitalist and exploitative to create a working class which can realize communism by 2035...72...2100 idk just trust us and the state will eventually give up its power 

6. Many of the dissidents and contemporaries of Marx and later Lenin who are also socialists and communists don't see this authoritarian offshoot as a legitimate interpretation of their movement which was much broader, and which these regimes often violently persecuted as ""degenerate"" and ""counter-revolutionary"" 

7. These authoritarian regimes used the language of socialism for moral force and the US liked calling it socialist to associate these regimes with the broader socialist tradition. So both major world super powers and propaganda outlets during the cold War agreed on what they called it for different reasons.

As for real life instances, not really since the world is still largely dominated by the idea of nation-states.

There are some small sporadic uprisings, events and societies that are worth studying and understanding like the Paris Commune, Israeli Kibbutzes, the Zapatista territory in Mexico, Rojava in Syria, Makhnovia in Ukraine, the Korean Peoples Association in Manchuria... and the push towards worker-coops is seen by some as a step toward a democratized economy. People hotly debate each of these

Hard to blame Ukraine for turning over the nukes with that kind of promise: expensive to maintain, and if someone were to have stolen one in the then-impoverished former USSR member, Ukraine would have borne the blame. Plus, in theory, if neither country attacked Ukraine and honored their treaty, Ukraine would only need a token military to hold out for their much bigger allies to come running, and we know from the history of countries that count on the US security umbrella that not having to pay for much of a military is excellent for development and growth of a nation. 

Now?

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/16/a-coup-a-counter-coup-and-a-russian-victory-in-kazakhstan

This proposal isn't President Tokayev generously offering to reduce his own authority. Really, it's the latest stage in negotiations with the parliament and the military, with Tokayev desperate to find a way to stay in power in some form. 

The proximate cause of the January unrest was a colossal spike in fuel prices, making driving and home heating unaffordable for ordinary citizens.

 >The Democracy Index is an index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the research division of the Economist Group, a UK-based private company which publishes the weekly newspaper The Economist. Akin to a Human Development Index but centrally concerned with political institutions and freedoms, the index attempts to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries and territories, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring pluralism, civil liberties and political culture.

As an American I kind of want all speech to be free, no matter how dumb, but the internet has changed how I view this matter after the fuckery Russia and the Republican Party unleashed on us in the last decade.

Propaganda is poison and the internet is the new delivery mechanism. Before the internet these radical treasonous fuckwits could only spread their hate/propaganda in closed environments and their movements were largely ineffective in a generational sense. With the advent of the net, though, the echo chamber is real and the hatred/misinformation is spreading at a lightning-fast rate (so fast it's damn scary, not gonna lie).

Sometimes you just have to ban horrible shit that has a propensity to spread and sow discord in your populace---for the good of the majority.

Because this is so important, protecting dumb speech is a side effect we must have as a price. 

Every revolution starts as ideas that spreads and sows discord. Plenty of scientific breakthroughs were suppressed because they sowed discord. Frankly, sometimes good ideas sow discord.

That's not to defend Russian propaganda. But the way to fight Russian propaganda is calling it out and debunking it at scale wherever it appears. At the end of the day, the propaganda isn't spread via mind control, it's spread by communicating with people.

Places like Russia and China don't really have that, as we've seen from people who protest or speak against Putin/Xi in public being arrested at best and straight up disappeared at worst. *That* is what ""no free speech"" truly means.

Banning propaganda does not infringe on free speech at all. Banning misinformation does not infringe on free speech. Platforms not tolerating hate speech does not infringe on free speech. Free speech is not, nor has it ever been, a universal ""get out of jail free"" card which lets you get away with saying anything and everything. If you threaten to kill someone, you may still be arrested. If you lie in court, you may still be charged with contempt. If you sign a contract, and then breach it, you can be sued. Why? Because words have consequences, as they should, even in a country with free speech. 

I've never met anyone who is pro-free speech (as in, the definition where anyone can say anything with 0 consequences rather than the actual legal definition) who also thinks it should be okay to lie in court or press false charges...

There are a few problems here in which I do not have the answer to...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law

This is the big one. If you say something dumb enough, people start to believe it, and the defender will spend inordinate amounts of time debunking the bullshit. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie

Also people promoting propaganda have a massive toolset. For example it starts to put doubt in everything. Is this post to you real? Am I a bot? Are the 4 posts that agree with me and disagree with you on this real people or are they bots. Are the sites that I link to proving my point based on any factual truth, or are they controlled by me?

>If the propaganda is being successful, that's a sign the alternate view isn't being communicated well

This doesn't really jive with how reality works. See reality rarely is defended as it just is.

That's the problem: Now when you try to prove your claims with actual hard evidence instead of them re-evaluating their position and actually changing their minds they will double down and basically do a Principal Skinner: ""Am I out of touch? No... it's the children who are wrong!""

This encapsulates the brainwashed Fox viewer/Trump supporter to a T. They've been so perfectly brainwashed that they can no longer see themselves or their 'trusted' leaders/news sources as ever wrong---it's everyone else that's wrong because *they're the smart ones in the end*. Everyone wants to be right and everyone wants to be the smart one in the herd---Qanon is also another perfect example of this doubling-down mentality: They alone are smart enough to see the links between 'the bad guys' and everyone else are just mindless sheep. Trying to convince anyone, especially brainwashed Trumpers/Qanons/GOP'ers that they're the ones that have been had this entire time is a tall order, even with proof shoved in their faces because 'fake news' is the ultimate cop-out that you cannot convince them from. It's a brick wall, essentially, and until you find a way to convince them that 'fake news' is only applicable in terms of the news *they* are consuming the conversation cannot go *anywhere*.

 >Brandolini's law, also known as the bullshit asymmetry principle, is an internet adage that emphasizes the difficulty of debunking false, facetious, or otherwise misleading information, especially in comparison to the difficulty of creating the misinformation in the first place. It states that ""The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than is needed to produce it"".
 
**[Big lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie)** 
 
 >The big lie (German: gro√üe L√ºge) is a gross distortion or misrepresentation of the truth, used especially as a propaganda technique. The German expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, to describe the use of a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone ""could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Hitler claimed that the technique had been used by Jews to blame Germany's loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist political leader in the Weimar Republic.

The situation in Ukraine is beyond tragic, and the Kremlins and Putins actions are criminal, but Nato is not the world police. I'm astounded by the number of people calling for Nato, which is a defensive pact, to engage in actions that would have a high probability of resulting in nuclear war, and thus the destruction of the entire planet. 

UN peacekeepers could achieve what your suggesting, but Russia has veto power on the security council and would not allow this.

I think the current strategy will work, albeit it is not going to be quick.

Just like the 'russian' aliens . The 'nazi' aliens. The 'assyrian' aliens. Being ruthless and perhaps pillaging and destroying everything .

It doesn't matter whether someones from space far away, or nearby -- people are always people. So what someone has advanced technology - that means nothing, they're just like anyone else!  Perhaps they too see it to be ruthless with that advanced technology using it to harm others. So what they live in a different 'alien' body, they're just a regular person that lives in that unusual looking body! Everyone can make mistakes!

Any amount of technology NEVER means some 'greater good'. It always depends on how its used..

No. Need to care about everyone and look to changing people by showing them the right way.

This whole mess is SPECIFICALLY because people are caring more about authority than each other and maybe perhaps absolutely psychopathic and enjoying killing and hurting people.

Therefore. Need to look to informing people to show the right way -- since see how people maybe are mindless and only care about authority / psychopathic - therefore they just do not know the right way..! The right way is of caring for everyone and questioning everything!

Explain that a flag is just an inanimate rectangular piece of perhaps fabric waving in the wind.

'Government', 'country name', 'banner name' is just a made up name! Just a made up inanimate label! 

People caring more about made up inanimate nonsense, authority, than each other!

Detain, apprehend people - not just immediately kill people - even if they're delusional / brainwashed or psychopathic. Actually set an example to show the right way!!!! Detain, destroy or take away their weapons if necessary -- just not kill..!

Think. To even imagine what it means for someone else to actually exist.. That there may actually be someone else ALSO existing..? That they are actually experiencing their own life and your simply not them.. Just imagine if you were them! Thats why should care for each other! NOT LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND NOR WISH DEATH AND SUFFERING ON ANYONE!!!!

Dispel delusions, talk to people, show the right way, set an example, being truthful. To actually help each other out!

Detain, show the right way, be truthful. Not torture. Torture just adds indefinite pain and suffering, ie 'PTSD' - torture is not the right way. Its not setting a good example. Its not being a friend. It only prolongs suffering making it harder to have a friendship. Should care about everyone and anyone.",1647444071.0,1

So, you're nitpicking that a species that possibly doesn't even abide by the speed of light anymore, worries about a gravity well of an earth sized planet! 

I was just joking around obviously, but I don't think it's too far fetched if we are already at this stage of imagination, that they just stop by earth because it's near at the time to refill their solar system sized fleet!

The replacement VA did a decent job, especially considering the 3rd season had some of the most drastic changes even seen. I heard that was eventually reversed, which I'm not a fan of tbh.

Skarsg√•rd on filming the scene:

>>!‚ÄúIt was the end of a very long, complex shot of the Viking berserkers raiding a Slav village. The choreography was so difficult, with all these elements, 50 people fighting simultaneously, the extras and the horses‚Ä¶ making it look perfect was a real undertaking.‚Äù And then, there was the moment he really had to, er, sink his teeth into. ‚ÄúThat climax, where I rip a guy‚Äôs throat out and howl at the moon‚Ä¶ it was primal. I just let it all out. I was exhausted, and I think you see it in the shot. I was a wreck. Truly a wreck.‚Äù!<

As far as historical accuracy goes, it's wildly off the mark, almost 100% fiction, but I'm willing to forgive that because of a brilliant soundtrack, engaging story, superb acting by Ken Watanabe, Tom Cruise and the rest of the crew, and superb attention to detail in almost every facet of the movie (costumes, fight choreography, stunts, set design and so on). The ending is also really touching, my wife and I shed a few tears the last time we saw it.

I will say that I think the fight scenes deserve more credit, they feel incredibly epic while also remaining realistic and believable. The final charge scene is particularly good. Bit of movie trivia, I [recently learned](https://animalfair.com/2003/12/30/samurai/) that the horses they used didn't suffer a single injury during filming, they probably deserve just as much recognition as the human actors for how they fall so convincingly in the final charge.",1647414337.0,44

Still I wouldn‚Äôt just disregard this movie as Hollywood fantasy. Because when you look at it as a depiction of the Meiji Restauration in Japan and how old practices and a new reality clashed, it is actually quite viable. It gives a good look into this particular timeframe of a culture that was redefining itself in a generation. In less than 50 years a nation went from a medieval system to fully fledged industrialism and on the way a lot of cultural norms have to be questioned. Which always results in conflict.

10868,movies,The Last Samurai is a beautiful movie,,1647406866.0,268,714,0.86,Danhuangmao,"There's no shortage of movies about Japanese history that have all-Japanese casts, mind.

For example: The 2010 film Hanjiro tells a much more accurate version of the Satsuma Rebellion that inspired The Last Samurai. The Japanese remake of Unforgiven (itself also titled Unforgiven) deals with the aftermath of this era change. When The Last Sword Is Drawn follows reminisces of the war that led to that era change. And of course there's the 1974 film The Last Samurai (no white people to be seen!) which follows one man through the dying days of the samurai also.

My guess is that because this era of Japanese history is alien to most American viewers, this American film chose to have an outsider character from a more familiar culture be introduced to this setting, learning and asking the right questions to help us as an audience understand it better too. But yes, also because Hollywood still struggles when it comes to casting an Asian lead for a blockbuster.",1647417180.0,5

Hollywood very often gets shit on because of their horrible/misinformed portrayals of foreign culture. To see a movie that not only overcomes that but also kind of fosters a mutual love for it among Westerners and Easterners alike, is a triumph.

I felt similarly when I heard that Ghost Of Tsushima (a samurai game which was developed in the United States) was absolutely praised in Japan.

It's a very romanticized retelling of the Meiji Restoration that borrows some elements from the real story and fictionalizes a lot of elements for the sake of a good story. As you said though, the way it depicts this moment of great change in Japanese society is pretty on point and captures the essence of how it must have felt. The changing of the political order, the passing of an era, the conflict between the old and new, all of this is brilliantly captured.

There's a brief moment in the final battle where you begin to believe that they could actually win this. The sight of all those horsemen charging out towards certain death for the sake of honor is incredibly powerful and moving. You feel the entire weight of a warrior-society doing what it has been trained for generations to do. Then those gatling guns begin to fire and you know that they never had a chance to begin with. It was always going to end like this with a new modern Japanese society replacing the old. Yet their commitment to the warrior code and courage in the face of unstoppable change is something that I think people everywhere can admire.

As a consequence, they remain desperately underrepresented in state institutions, with the result that their interests are often overlooked and ignored.

The environment and experience of someone of greater wealth and power is different than that of someone who does not have that wealth and power. 

Memories of the past fade over time in comparison to more recent ones. Over time this wears on a person unconsciously, much like water over a rock, it changes the shape and feel of that rock. Power changes the shape and feel of the behavior of a person, because their experience is different. Its not just power that has this effect, poverty, having loving friends/family, Social Media, the Internet, propaganda, really anything that can have a consistent impact on someone over time.

For power, not all people are already assholes when they start. They become that way over time because of the environment and experience having power exerts. ""The trappings of the throne.""

They propose that there are only two possible reasons people would behaviorally avoid power, and that's just utterly silly.

I personally don't avoid power \*either\* because I am worried about the responsibility, \*or\* because I think powerful people are inherently bad coercive people.

I avoid power because I believe in being the change I want to see in the world and I think that outcomes for everyone would be better if power were more fairly distributed. It's not that people with power are inherently bad coercive people, it's just that any one group of people having power while another doesn't inherently leads to systematic devaluation of the perspective of those without power.

So as one important example, old people have more power than young people generally, and as a result the concerns of young people (e.g. climate change) are systematically undervalued by our societies.

It has nothing to do with anyone being evil or malicious, I don't think old people are evil, I just think they're ignorant of other people's perspectives and selfish - just like everyone else is... It doesn't have anything to do with power corrupting anyone, it just has to do with imbalances of power inherently creating corrupt social structures. It's not a value judgement against having power, or against people with power. Instead I am making a value judgement about the nature of societies where power is distributed unevenly, and saying I don't want to participate in the creation of greater power inequality.

I'm a big believer in the Democracy at Work ""movement"" though of course it's totally stalled because the West and especially America are backsliding recently. I am a person who would love to have power through a democratic process, because I think I'm smart and a good leader. But I don't want to have power that is granted to me by my boss, whose power is granted to him by his boss, etc. etc.

I would be totally fine with having power over people who democratically chose to invest that power in me. But in America you can't really run for office unless you're rich, i.e. a person who has successfully attained power in the private sector through non-democratic means. So I remain a lowly wage slave.",1647410739.0,41

For some reason, in my field (software development) this is often considered the ""natural"" path : you start as software developer, become senior developer, then you become Team Lead/Project Owner. Team Lead/PO don't develop anything though. They report and transmit directives.

> Abstract
>
>Though we typically think that power is desirable, individuals will sometimes avoid power. **One explanation for this behavior is some individuals are averse to the responsibility associated with power and will therefore avoid positions of power.** However, people may also avoid power because they perceive it as being inherently negative. This is supported by research on lay theories of power, which suggests that those who endorse the coercive lay theory perceive powerful people as manipulative and deceitful. **In this paper, we propose a new theory of power aversion that expands upon the coercive lay theory to more thoroughly explain how negative perceptions of power cause some individuals to avoid it.**

They simply give an example of one possible explanation (responsibility aversion) and then simply denote that they will focus on another one for their specific research. Their research isn't about ""trying to give every explanation possible on why people avoid responsibility"" it's explicitly about the perception of power and how it influence responsibility aversion.",1647426791.0,22

You have to clarify this with supplemental information since the history of the Electoral College and what it originally was has been completely forgotten by history (and would be completely unrecognizable compared against the modern incarnation).

The Electoral College was originally intended to be a temporary body (the exact number of equaling the whole of Congress), whose members would be chosen by the people to represent them, and given the task of researching all of the various Presidential candidates and casting their Electoral vote for the one they felt would be best.

Over the years, the States gradually replaced this system with a straight popular vote, wherein the winning candidate's party would choose Electors that would cast pre-decided votes, essentially becoming a ceremonial task.

>It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any preestablished body, but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.

>It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations."" - **Alexander Hamilton**

I'd say that's quite a prominent historical example :)

I'd also like to challenge the assumption of an uninformed populace. In a democratic model based on sortition, the randomly selected sample of the population will first have to be informed by expert panels, then discuss it among each others, and only then do they get to vote (ensuring they're informed first) . This is very different from a referendum or public opinion polls where you ask the population what they think about a certain policy without having them go through the motions of being informed by experts and being exposed to different viewpoints (discussions) first. Finally, I feel like implementing a democratic model based on sortition may actually cause people to become better informed over the long term.

Is it because the speed of the beam, or maybe the magnetic field? Also, the article didn't mention at all how the small pulsar emits antimater. Do we ever know how this process works?

I'm particularly curious to know who's been spreading this alleged myth, because the premise sounds like a straw-man to me. Are there not decades of historians who have described rich and complex economies among indigenous societies? 

Also, if many settlers didn't accept indigenous individuals as fully human, deserving of the same rights as themselves, then isn't that the core reason they disregarded indigenous people's property rights? Were settlers justifying the annexation of land by saying, ""Hey, these people don't care about property rights..."" or were they saying, ""Hey, these primitives aren't really people, so they have no right to own property...""?

The ditches were constantly flooded, and fish grew in them living off insects. The effect of this was three fold, the raised beds never had over or underwatered roots, the ditches helped keep the crop warm at night, and a secondary crop of fish protein was obtained. Some of the newer green house concepts include aquaculture like this for these reasons).

> Abundant land and strong property rights are conventionally viewed as key factors underpinning U.S. economic development success. This view relies on the ‚ÄúPristine Myth‚Äù of an empty undeveloped land, but the abundant land of North America was already made productive and was the recognized territory of sovereign Indigenous Nations. We demonstrate that the development of strong property rights for European/American settlers was mirrored by the attenuation and increasing disregard of Indigenous property rights. We argue that the dearth of discussion of the dispossession of Indigenous nations results in a misunderstanding of some of the core themes of U.S. economic history.

I was just reading what the authors have to say about this last night.

Basically, many indigenous people have a concept of property rights, but they are more 'distributed'. 

The thinking was less ""individual property rights"" than it was: let's all plant food together for the sustainability of the village...but what gives us the right to plant *here* is because our tribe *owns* some ritual implement.

This is different from the Western-European concept of you *yourself* being autonomous.

Now, European self-autonomy is kind of a trick. It's touted as personal freedom, but in reality it is putting all of the onus of existence on you despite you never asking to exist in the first place. And by putting the onus on you it's simultaneously telling you that ""you get what you deserve"" whether that be poverty or aristocracy.

Because after all, *you own YOU*, right?

It's gaslighting.

And when you have gaslighting you need to invent a reason for yourself to keep your delusion going (because ultimately most humans don't like to think they like being rapacious and always need to be the hero of their own story).

Anecdotal but I def heard the idea that native Americans had no concept of property rights. No idea who started it. But at least when I was young. It was a common ideal within the media.

> Are there not decades of historians who have described rich and complex economies among indigenous societies? 

Most def. Also have not read the paper. But as with much from the 17 to 1900s the effect of the properganda told by the west to validate there actions is valuable. We are seeing much evidence of the effect of anti abolitionist properganda in Europe effecting the views of westerners towards Africans  to this day. 

I'd value research on this idea from native American perspectives. 

>Also, if many settlers didn't accept indigenous individuals as fully human, deserving of the same rights as themselves, 

Yes. Very much so. But to redraw comparisons from african slavery. The same is true as to why that was supported. Yet we know there was a direct effort within the Europeen press to support that ideal. 

Ideas have a start. Society has a duty to evaluate why and how flawed ideas became so widespread. Even if that is not the goal of papers like this. They can help later researchers evaluate such. 

I sort of agree with all you say. Especially the idea of research papers being to expensive to view. ^^%_^ that. 

But papers looking at the results and effects of bad assumptions can be a huge help in formulating future theories even if in themselves they seem minimal.

We are seeing huge evidence that europeens. Came to new lands and failed to in anyway evaluate  the people outside of there own narrow perspectives. The effect and harn from this is huge. 

For example

To this day westerners have no evaluation of african and native American architecture. Due to the there own views that such should be built to last. Anything built with a non permanent mindset is seen as excluded from the field. 

Yet the way both culture built to use the enviroment to enhance their own comfort. Is now obviously of value. Yet ignored and haveing to be rediscovered due to our ancestors own hubris.

Yes, it is a common myth that ""Native Americans didn't understand land ownership"", one that is weirdly prominent in spite of the fact that it effectively-infantalizes Natives. It is also largely-false.

If a group practiced agriculture, they knew what land-divisions were. They (depending on the time, place and culture) didn't really have ***private*** land ownership (from the cultures I am familiar with, it was more of a communal/family ownership-concept, with unworked land being returned to the group) , at least until the Europeans got involved, but they definitely understood the concept of ""this is yours, this is ours"". 

The Natives of New England were, as you say, fighting amongst each other for farming territory, hunting grounds and fishing spots *long* before the Europeans got here.

Notably, Pacific Northwest Tribes had conceptions about land ownership and property rights that surpassed even what most Europeans had. They had intellectual property rights that gave rights to certain songs or prayers to individuals or clans. Some totem pole or canoe designs were privately owned and could be bought and sold as well.

These communities frequently engaged in economic warfare with neighboring tribes, and clans within a tribe often feuded with rival clans in economic terms. For example, at a Potlatch one clan or tribe might give an especially generous gift knowing that their rival will have to bankrupt themselves attempting to match the gift, and once they're bankrupt and vulnerable they may be forced to trade away valuable status symbols like generations-old medicine rituals or a nice longhouse in order to have enough food to survive until the next salmon season.

The salmon and berry cycle in the region may be why they developed such sophisticated economics and intricate totem poles and whatnot. They didn't fish the oceans as much as you might think, and most tribes also did not venture far inland to hunt for game in the forests. They tended to live at river mouths and collect tons of salmon during their spawning season, then preserve it to last the year. 

This left then ample time to do other things, like barter or carve. But it also meant that a bad spawning season or a loss of their food stores either due to disaster or trade war could starve a family for months.

Supposedly, the first encounter with Europeans involved the Natives charging the explorers for the grass their sheep were eating and the wood the explorers had cut down to build a fire with.

That's not necessarily true.

The generalized notion that an area is roughly the territory of one tribe or another might be as old as human society, but that's not the same thing as *individuals* having a recognized title to a particular plot of land.  That's a product of legal systems and bureaucracies, and technologies like accurate maps and land surveys.  

There are still today people whose farms and homes have been in the family for generations, but for which there is no title of ownership tying the land to them.  Which causes all sorts of problems when someone else comes in (often a big corporation) and obtains the title to the land and tells the people who have worked that land for generations that it's not theirs.

That ""distributed"" model of ownership existed in Europe too, where a lot of prime land was collectively owned until as late as the 1800s.

Historically, as much as half of the land was common land - unfenced land with collective ownership. Everyone could use their local common land and could at least subsistence farm on it, graze animals, cut wood, etc. This was a social safety net of sorts. So long as you were able, you could work part of the commons to feed a family and survive.

Others made a deliberate living from working the commons. The old model of a shepherd travelling with a free-roaming flock, for example, is a common-land farming practice making use of large, unfenced stretches of wild land in collective ownership.

No-one individually owned or had title to this land, but communities certainly viewed stretches of common land as their collective area.

Starting in earnest in the 1600s, English lords steadily took common land into private ownership through enclosure to dispossess the poor and then charge them rent (even charging peasants for the cost of building fences that would exclude them). This really picked up in the 1800s and spread across Europe and Russia. By the end of the 19th century, almost all land was fenced off for exclusive ownership and access. Though many people in Europe still have access to parks or greens or nature reserves, it is now generally illegal for them to farm, graze animals or cut wood on them.",1647439313.0,3

The two major areas of agricultural population density within the boundaries of the modern US in the Mississippian and Anasazi people collapsed pre contact almost certainly from a series of crop failures, and that similar level of technology and social cohesion and density was largely only retained by the tribal proto-states of the southeast. 

The indigenous peoples of the mid-Atlantic and New England East Coast that first interacted with both the Jamestown and Plymouth settlements, which did absolutely initially struggle with crop production, still did not practice the mass cereal based agriculture over the same continuously cultivated plot of land as did the colonists, and nor did they really need to given their low population density. Within a generation you had mass land cultivation in the colonial societies well beyond any native practices in the modern continental US.

Now that's very different of course from the extremely high density pre-contact societies in Mesoamerica, along the Andes, and potentially in certain parts of the Amazon, but still all of those had huge social collapses repeatedly almost certainly due to crop failure. 

And that's not an indictment of the intelligence or perseverance of these peoples - the climate of the Americas is absolutely brutal almost across the board vs. the major initial population centers across Eurasia. Hell, within the continental US, most places are both hotter and colder, and have more extreme weather, and have more acute and prolonged drought cycles then almost anywhere in Europe. It was hard to ever get a population dense enough that a similar mind set to land cultivation would be needed. And where it did in the places mentioned above, it looked like it did in any other large agricultural society full of large irrigation systems and general disregard for natural systems - the Classical Maya for example almost certainly destroyed themselves through their deforestation and methods of large scale crop management.

So to end my late night ranting, this story which I was told in school is almost certainly a romanticisation and over generalization of natives within the US. At the end of the day, you are looking at effectively neolithic societies with no wheel, beasts of burden, or metal farming implements with an extremely low population density that did not require a similar view to farm or land productivity in general that makes any of their practices difficult to compare to the mass land cultivation of European colonists that would effectively cover the East Coast in both cash crop and cereal production within a generation. And where mass agriculture did occur in the Americas, largely out of the modern US to support population densities you see in Eurasia (or in the case of the Aztecs, probably greater), it was if anything very similar in its rather blunt and environmentally short sighted mechanics.",1647413370.0,30

Suddenly, a group of men come up and say ""we have the weaponry to wipe out your enemies, but we want you to promise we get their territory when we're done. You can't come and take anything."" The tribes would agree because they wanted the enemy gone and this seemed like a very powerful ally to keep happy. The settlers then wage war on the enemy tribe with the help of the first tribe. It's a wash, and the settlers take the land. 


After a few years, a third tribe approaches the settlers and says ""We have a generational feud with the first tribe. You should not trust them. Help us defeat them."" And the settlers say ""alright, but we're keeping their land when we win because we're breaking our old treaty to do this."" And the third tribe agrees because they want their mortal enemies dead and this is a powerful ally to keep happy.


Rinse and repeat until there are only a few tribes remaining and they are ultimately forced to make a deal with the federal government for reservations (i.e. ""can you at least leave us somewhere to live?"").

SNEAKY EDIT: It also helped that there were a number of different colonies for the tribes to make deals with. America didn't unify as one nation until hundreds of years after the first colonies (and therefore deals with the natives) were set up. The web of alliances went both ways. END OF EDIT


You're also correct that the natives understood a more communal form of land ownership. Everything belonged to the tribe. They would fight other tribes to gain hunting territory and whatnot, but once claimed anyone from the tribe could hunt/fish/fell trees/etc. If an outsider trespassed, then anyone from the tribe was justified to stop it. The settlers, on the other hand, owned property individually (like we do today). The government may negotiate to purchase large swaths of territory, but then it got parceled apart and sold to a farmer, a blacksmith, a tailor--individual people. 


The natives eventually realized they'd given up almost all the good hunting and fishing lands, so they began making deals for access to it, even if they can't have ownership. The settlers' governing body can only give permission to publicly owned lands, not an individual's parcel. There are many instances of natives who didn't understand the minutia of the deal, they wander onto private property, get killed as a trespasser, the tribe takes revenge against the ""murderer,"" and it ends with the settlers wiping out the entire tribe. Even more territory, one less neighbor.


The main lesson is that the natives essentially got swindled in every different manner and direction you can imagine. They sold hundreds of acres of land for like two winters worth of corn and six horses. Crazy unfair deals like that. It's a very sad story.",1647399421.0,7

Yeah, they *kind of* understood about spreading disease... just not fully.

There is documented evidence from the 1700's of military commanders in Pennsylvania discussing the possibility of spreading smallpox to Native Americans as a battle strategy. An exposed blanket was purchased with the intent of using it to spread smallpox. So, they knew it wasn't like God striking people down at random -- it was an environmental contagion.

If you possess someone else's property without their express permission, maintain that property, actively keep others from doing the same, do so openly so that it is overtly obvious to the property owner and anyone else that you are possessing the property, and don't do it as some of some sort of joint collaboration with other people... you can legally claim the land after a set period of continuous time. It's generally 7 years but some states/counties/towns have different lengths of time set.

The way this usually comes in to play would be like...

You buy a house that has a big open field behind it connected to your back yard, nobody uses that field. It could be owned by someone else, or owned by a bank somewhere or whatever. For 7 years you use that field as an extension of your backyard, mowing it, cleaning it, maybe putting a swingset on it, etc. After the 7 years (or however long based on your area) you can claim that field legally as your own.

Though keep in mind that property rights do still come in to play during that 7 year process, so if the owner does actually notice you doing this during that 7 year period, they are within their rights to kick you off their property or go after you for trespassing.

Another big way this comes in to play which you have to watch out for is with neighbors who are assholes. Say that there's a section of your property next to your neighbor's property and it's too awkwardly positioned or small for you to really make use of it, but it works wonderfully as an extension to your neighbor's side yard and they ""do you a favor"" by mowing it and taking care of it whenever they mow their yard.

The Pueblos had farming in the Rio Grande valley set up so well they would often over produce and be unable to pick all their crops in season. Similarly, along the central California coast, the Chumash were described as living in abundance and would often feast visitors with mounds of food. That being said, they would disband their settlements when things got difficult (drought) and make seasonal trips to take advantage of resources elsewhere.

By contrast North America was a very healthy place for Europeans once they figured out how to not die immediately. Comparing techniques is also a bit apples and oranges a bit because the crops were different and Euros had farm animals like hogs. 

The Northeasterners were using the 3 sisters system which is a famous example of a sustainability/production increasing technique, but I think they also rotated around to new areas and farming did lead to soil degradation in some more densely populated places. Corn is considerably more productive in calories per acre than wheat, but it's also notoriously nutrient demanding.

The Americas are full of repeated population collapses almost certainly from climate based crop failure, often directly on top of the location of the precursor society. The Inca for example were effectively the third civilization to get to almost identical levels of technological advancement in the same general area within the proceeding 1,000 years (albeit the Inca were more advanced, were denser, were larger, and likely the first to adopt a true modern centralized state). The Mayans have two very similar periods of advancement and population density, and the Aztecs, while new comers who inherited but also organically developed a great deal of their society where also basically on top of two prior waves of advancement in the area around the valley of Mexico.

You're looking at multiple Bronze Age Collapse level events over time in different societies. This resulted in - and this a broad unfair generalization as the civilization of the Americas did not develop on the more (and still generalized) liner path of Eurasian societies that indirectly traded a lot more technology (there was heavy new world trading but it wasn't in commodities and metallic items that conferred technology to the same extent as in the Eastern Hemisphere) - multiple false starts resulting in what were effectively Bronze Age civilization that would meet a terrible drought and then collapse down as they could not longer sustain the mass agriculture needed for the dense urban societies they made. Now when Europeans showed up, it looks like everyone in North America was going through another round of collapse, but who knows maybe that would have been the round that stuck, and got them into a sustainable Iron Age level of advancement.

The continental US is a bigger question mark in that it had extremely low population densities pre-contact (somewhere between like 6-8 million) and had probably only a single round of urbanization before it collapsed just before European arrivals. But these civilizations were decidedly Neolithic and probably needed a few more rounds to become permanently self sustaining.

At the end of the day, as I was commenting on other post, the climate of the Americas is absolutely brutal compared to any Eurasian ""cradle of civilization"" (when they were actually happening - Nile valley and Mesopotamia are way more hostile now). It's largely hotter, and colder, and has worse droughts than anything in the Eastern Hemisphere. And even though you do have stuff analogous to the Bronze Age collapse in the Indus Valley, and perhaps in pre-history China, you generally don't get the complete discontinuity in urbanized society anywhere in Eurasia to the same degree in Americas. 

And as a result, at contact you have a civilization at 1,000 years more advanced in some cases or like legitimately 5,000 years of advancement in other places.

Without the study of our history, science would become stagnant and begin a recursive loop of re-discovering previously created knowledge. 

When an engineer develops a new technology, it is up to the people of that time to log that information, and preserve it. If it is lost, it is up to historians to recover that information, restore it, and allow the current scientific field access so it can be re-examined and further developed. 

For instance:

The folding method that produced Damascus and Damascene steel blades that were made in the Middle East from 540 A.D to 1800 A.D - the blades were sharper, more flexible, and stronger than western contemporary swords.  The steel had been produced for 11 centuries, and in one generation, the means of its manufacture was entirely lost.   
  
C.S. Smith, the chief metallurgist in the Manhattan project, brought the mystery of these blades to the attention of the metallurgy community in a book published in 1960. Another paper in 1983 cited historical records of accounts from people who had watched the blades being made, but knew nothing of metallurgy. 

In 1998, scientist J.D. Verhoeven and his graduate student performed several experiments based on these logs and along with the help of several skilled blacksmiths to forge each variation of the metal composition, they [rediscovered the composition](https://www.mse.iastate.edu/news/john-verhoeven/) that would create this steel.

As it turns out, the technique was not 'lost', it just stopped working. The ""secret"" that produced such high quality weapons was not in the technique of the swordsmiths, but rather on the composition of the material they were using. The swordsmiths got their steel ingots from India. In the 19th Century, the mining region where those ingots came from changed. These new ingots had slightly different impurities than the prior ingots. Because of the new composition, the new ingots could not be forged into Damascus steel. Because the swordsmiths did not understand the nature of the material they used, when that material changed Damascus steel was lost.

And so, we regained a lost technology through the application scientific method *because historians kept good records*. 

Because of instances like this, and how often scientists RELY on historical records for developing new hypothesis to perform new experiments, I do not see history as a distinct and separate field of work from science. It is an extension - the record log. The recordkeeper so modern research *has accurate sources to cite*.

Keeping accurate records of current and past knowledge is deeply important if we are to continue to develop new knowledge about the universe. 

Without accurate records, we enter a chain of 'citing someone who cited someone who cited a guy who pulled an anecdote about wasps out of his ass' that slows the advancement of scientific progress. 

Wooldridge's 'machinelike' sphex wasp 'facts' have significantly influenced philosophy and the biological study of neurons and cognition in insects, despite the fact that it was an unsourced anecdote he stated as fact in 1963 in his book - it was not an actual experiment. 

Not only the storage of history, but the thoughtful curation and re-examining of historic accounts saying 'this is what happened. This is how it happened, this the influences of the time which altered the conclusions'  is what allows science to flourish. 

The giants whose shoulders we stand on - The more clearly we remember their truths, the taller they grow. 

I think it would be akin to shooting one's own foot, to try and distance science from history, when they are so intrinsically entwined. 

Finally:

History is the study of change over time. 

Chemists study the change of chemicals over time. Biologists study cellular life as it changes over time.

Here's one section on Mexico:

> Mexico. Europeans arrived in what is now Mexico in 1519 CE. Yet, the first comprehensive census only took place in 1568 CE, and
tribute records are only available as documentary evidence from the late 1540s (Cook and Borah, 1960; Whitmore, 1991). For central
Mexico (the most populous region in Mexico) a population of 25.3 million in 1519 CE has been estimated from tribute records (Borah and Cook, 1969), which would make it one of the most populous regions in the world at the time. Zambardino (1980) highlights the uncertainties in Borah and Cook's approach and arrived at a population between **2.2 and 28 million**. 

> ... 

> Pre-contact population estimates for central Mexico and Yucatan combined, which is considered representative for all of Mexico, range from **less than 3 million to over 52 million** with many at around 20 million

I cant comment on the first two, as I cant access them, but the third talks about one particular small region in new mexico, to quote the discussion section:

> Comparing our LiDAR-based population estimates and tree-ring data to the 17th century documentary records produced by colonial Spaniards reveals the tempo of depopulation in the Jemez Province (Fig. 4A). Our archaeological estimate of **5,000‚Äì8,000** residents accords with the record of fray Geronimo Z√°rate Salmer√≥n, a Franciscan friar stationed among the Jemez between 1621 and 1626. During his stint in the Province, fray Geronimo chronicled the baptism of 6,566 ‚Äúsouls‚Äù (49). This figure sits remarkably close to the mean of our 5,000- to 8,000-person archaeological calculation, at 63% of the maximum regional population estimate. Combined with Kulisheck‚Äôs evidence for sustained relative populations from field house data (29, 32‚Äì35), the archaeological evidence and Z√°rate Salmer√≥n‚Äôs record suggest a modicum of demographic continuity from pre-Hispanic times into the early colonial period in the Jemez Province. In other words, the preponderance of historical and archaeological evidence indicates that no large-scale demographic collapse occurred before the first direct contacts between the Jemez and Europeans (pre-1541) or during the period of early Spanish exploration, before the establishment of permanent colonial settlements (1541‚Äì1598).

> Following the expansion of missionary efforts in the 1620s, Spanish colonial records register a large-scale diminution of the Jemez population over the subsequent 20 y (Table 1). Half the populace reportedly succumbed to two waves of epidemic diseases, violence, and famine by 1630, leaving just 3,000 remaining in the Province (50). The number of Jemez residents further dropped to just **1,860** persons by 1644, according to colonial records (51).

So even taking this paper at the high end of its estimate it is ""only"" a reduction of 80% and at the low end 65%. My point was that stating concretely that 90% died is not something you can back up with evidence, just that a significant fraction of the population did.",1647445733.0,1

A farmer needs to know how many cattle he has and the settlers of the Americas regarded the natives in the same way. Before then the Americans had no need to know exactly how many of them there were.

Regardless, I would take any specific claims about specifics of the depopulation of the Americas with a very large amount o salt. Suffice to say that huge numbers died of diseases brought (unwittingly) by Europeans and that in turn depopulated the continent significantly and paved the road for colonisation and subjugation.",1647431246.0,5

There was a particular idea about building a habitat into a crater. It had slanted floors and spun around so that there was a nice 1G environment. We can also spin up spaceships so that there's a 1G environment on those as well (or just accelerate at 1g)

Unless true gravity has some exotic element that's different from being spun up, this should hopefully combat DNA damage.

Fictional for those who are unfamiliar with SCP stories, but basically they find a physical tree that corresponds with the biological tree of life of species on earth.

Each species and subspecies represented as branches and smaller branches off that.

Basically they accidentally infect the tree with something that starts killing it off slowly. If the whole tree dies all life on earth dissappears.

They decide to cut off the infection and remove a major branch of the tree to try and save the rest. This branch represents the 7th kingdom of life called the Aeterns, and when the branch was cut off the whole kingdom of species dissappeared.

There were two suborders that went extinct for different reasons. 

1. Competition from other predators like cephalopods (squids n‚Äô stuff) and jawed-fish (The armoured placoderms were a big one.) caused many of the larger, clawed, deep sea, predatory species (The Eurypterines) pictured above to go extinct as they slowly lost the evolutionary arms race even though they were fierce predators. They were competing for the same food sources and were ‚ÄúOut-hunted‚Äù by jawed-fish. The largest species ‚ÄúJaekelopterus‚Äù is still the largest arthropod ever discovered. 

2. The Stylonurines were smaller and used there legs to scamper around the sea floor scavenging or filter feeding for food and eventually transitioned to more freshwater environments and some could live amphibious lifestyles on land and in the water. 
They lasted longer but were ultimately killed off during a mass extinction event known as ‚ÄúThe Great Dying‚Äù at the end of the Permian that killed off 70% of all terrestrial species and 96% of all marine species on Earth, mostly due to mega volcanoes in Russia erupting for like 2 million years and causing a ton of global warming.",1647432768.0,6

I work in a lab that tests pain in mouse models of classically painful diseases (cancer, rare bone diseases, etc). One of the tests we are trying to validate is how pain affects wheel running. We have these fancy cages where we hook up a wheel that has magnets and the electromagnetic signal when the mouse runs allows us to track it. 

Our mice LOVE running in them. Overnight (when they are most active) they can run between 1-3km. We want to see if they run less if they have a painful condition.

But here is the thing‚Ä¶ when we do other tests on them and put them back in their cage, they often get straight onto their wheel and start running. So they are running after they‚Äôve just done something a bit stressful (any handling, no matter how minor and how used to their handlers they are is going to be somewhat stressful). We also watch out for stereotypical behaviours in mice (repeated behaviours over and over again). So here is our dilemma. Is wheel running a stereotypical behaviour in mice in response to stress? Is it an enrichment activity that they enjoy that naturally reduces stress (we have other enrichment tools in their cages for them)? Or is it something that they naturally just enjoy doing, like what we see in wild mice?",1647415012.0,18

Couldn't keep him anymore and so I decided to set him free in the woods near a park. I left him near a hiking trail along with his hamster wheel. He loved his hamster wheel. It squeaked when he used it. To this day I wonder how long he survived and if he ever used his squeaky hamster wheel while enjoying his freedom. I imagine hikers passing by and hearing a subtle ""squeak squeak"" and wondering, curiously: ""That sounds like a hamster wheel."" Yes, dear hiker, it is a hamster wheel. Squeak, squeak.

12pm - Lunch, Southwest Chicken wrap with almond slivers for $4.99 in the cafeteria...meh

1:14pm - Finish up paperwork, check cages

1:17pm - Lil Petey is gone... will need to prep for the autopsy and more paperwork

2:30pm - Texted Dr. LeFevre... not sure where she went off to...I can't get started unless she's here to direct the procedure. ""Rules are rules after all"" .... *rolls eyes aaalll the way back*

The average American home uses around 39000000000000 (39 billion joules) of energy a year.

39 Billion divided by one year's worth of nonstop hamster spinning productivity is 2473 and some change.

Now hamsters aren't 1:1 stand ins for rats, but it at least gets us into the right order of magnitude.

A cursory look at rodent habits puts a regular running pattern at around 4-6 hours a day. So you'd probably run the wheels in shifts or multiply the amount of wheels out in the wild and cross your fingers that the work is distributed somewhat evenly.

Ultimately, if you had perfect control over their habits, you'd need 2473 rats running in 4 shifts throughout the day, putting it at roughly 10k rats on wheels to power an average American home.

Squirrels are a little bigger, so maybe you go for a rat/squirrel blend and do 7.5k? Or maybe you go get NYC sewer rats and overload the grid with 5.",1647414456.0,34

Each rat would generate 0.001167 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour totaling 0.028 kWh per day. (1)

The average U.S. residential household electricity consumption is 28.9 kWh per day. (2)

Some of those mice will inevitably be different genders and they will do what mice do and rapidly reproduce. Female mice can have up to 10 litters a year and usually have 6-8 mice at once. Within 3 months this dude can easily have upwards of 100 mice. 

It gets worse though. Mother mice, if in a stressful environment(like say a cage with multiple other mice in a strange giants home) will eat their babies, it‚Äôll be bloody and brutal. Iirc they eat their feet first for some reason so the babies suffer. Hell, sometimes they just eat their young for no reason, rodents just aren‚Äôt very good parents. It‚Äôs not just the babies you have to worry about, males will treat a cage like a gladiator ring if they feel too cramped or sometimes you just get one angry murderous mouse that picks the other mice off one by one.

(This means that an average of one transmission occurred for every 71 exposures.) This risk was similar regardless of whether the receptive partner was a man or woman.

No meta-analysis estimates currently exist for insertive anal sex (inserting the penis into the anus, also known as topping) but two individual studies were conducted to calculate this risk. The first, published in 1999, calculated the risk to be 0.06% (equivalent to one transmission per 1,667 exposures).2 However, due to the design of the study, this number likely underestimated the risk of HIV transmission. The second study, published in 2010, was better designed and estimated the risk to be 0.11% (or 1 transmission per 909 exposures) for circumcised men and 0.62% (1 transmission per 161 exposures) for uncircumcised men.3

Vaginal sex

A meta-analysis of 10 studies exploring the risk of transmission through vaginal sex was published in 2009.4 It is estimated the risk of HIV transmission through receptive vaginal sex (receiving the penis in the vagina) to be 0.08% (equivalent to 1 transmission per 1,250 exposures).

A meta-analysis of three studies exploring the risk from insertive vaginal sex (inserting the penis into the vagina) was estimated to be 0.04% (equivalent to 1 transmission per 2,500 exposures).4""

I thought this was more common knowledge. I didn‚Äôt know it was 10 times more likely, but I knew it was considerably more likely. That‚Äôs why back in the 80‚Äôs and stuff gay men were much more likely to contract aids than straight men. Now don‚Äôt take this as homophobic towards gay men because it applies to straight men and women having sex, but assholes aren‚Äôt meant to be fucked. The body doesn‚Äôt provide lubrication like it does for a vagina or the mouth. The anus also isn‚Äôt designed to stretch quite like a vagina does either. It‚Äôs made for poop to exit not a child. This means when you have anal sex you‚Äôre much more likely to give the receiver small tears in their anus. These little tears tend to not be super painful and they don‚Äôt even bleed when done correctly. However this allows the semen to enter the bloodstream and contract aids. It‚Äôs happens in vaginas but it‚Äôs much less common (but how they get aids). So if you‚Äôre going to have anal sex, make sure your partner is clean, use lots of lube, and go slow. 

This is also why drug users who use needs were effected in such large numbers when sharing needles. The needle goes in the infected persons veins getting blood on it and then into the other persons veins sharing the virus. Always make sure to use a clean needle. They are easily to get at most pharmacies and not expensive to stop the spread of viruses like this. Although honestly my best advice is to just skip these drugs because even if you don‚Äôt get aids, they can still ruin your life.",1647422845.0,0

When the Omicron varient of COVID appeared in ZA, I heard it was due to the disease being able to live long enough in people with compromised immune systems to mutate, and ZA has such a large number of people with poorly controlled/ not at all treated HIV infections. 

It only clicked with me then that there's another pandemic ongoing. So I finally set about learning about it and will take it as a win for personal growth. I had definitely been in the camp of ""omg aids, terrifying, very contagious"". I had heard that ""it's no longer a death sentence"", but it was a meaningless soundbite to me. I feel so sorry for that. I can't excuse my own ignorance. Now that I've gone down the rabbit hole of reading whatever I can to understand it, plus watching some of the documentaries, it really has been genuinely destigmatized for me. 

Proper HIV education (not just ""don't do this or you'll get aids"") should be for everyone. Everyone old enough to receive sex ed in schools should understand how it transmits, that U=U, and how to be safe against not just HIV transmission, but all other STIs. I don't consider myself to be unintelligent, or poorly educated, so I don't think I'm the only one with such a gap in my knowledge and education, and that needs to be addressed.

No, nice straw man. I called you ignorant because you called it a 'death sentence' and because you out right stated you would not sleep with somebody who has been diagnosed with HIV, when some HIV+ people represent no risk to you whatsoever.

It's perfectly reasonable you don't want to catch an incurable disease, even if it can be well treated these days.

I didn't. I've had sex with multiple HIV+ people in my life, yet I'm negative, how can that possibly be? Somehow I've protected my heath and avoided catching that 'deadly disease'. Probably something to do with being educated rather than ignorant, not subscribing to HIV stigma and actually understanding risk and when it doesn't exist.

It amazes me there are still people out there so ignorant. It hasn't been a 'death sentence' for a long time, and now has no impact on live expectancy.

>I‚Äôm definitely not gonna sleep with someone who has been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS

It's sad there is still so much stigma, and a shame you react like that. A person on treatment with a undetectable viral load cannot pass on the virus, at all. So you're far safer sleeping with the person who tells you they have HIV, because they know and know if they can pass on the virus, than somebody who doesn't know, and therefore could be HIV+ with a high viral load. A person with an undetectable viral load, and therefore incapable of passing it on is therefore not required to disclose their status (*in the UK, may be different elsewhere) to a sexual partner, and based on the stigma you display, I wouldn't blame them for not disclosing. I've slept with HIV+ people who have disclosed, because somebody who has disclosed is showing me they have an interest in their status, than somebody who never bothers to get tested and is an unknown.

It's such a non issue now that even where a relationship between is disclosed between two people where one is HIV+ and the other negative, if the HIV+ person has an undetectable viral load then condom use or PrEP is not encouraged because there is no risk to the negative partner.

If you're that worried, take PrEP, it's far more effective than condoms in preventing HIV.

The acute stage ends when the immune system fights off the illness to the point it is nearly dead in the system, but just enough persists, and the little buggers wage guerrilla war on the immune system that beat it up. 

During this time, which can be years, the person is HIV positive and still infectious but far far less likely to infect people than during Acute or later on as they transition to AIDS.

HIV starts to break down the Immune system and then replicate again, transitioning into AIDS. As this occurs they become more and more infectious. If you die of AIDS, it is of cancer or other illnesses caused by your weakened immune system.

Admittedly my post was written from a 1st world perspective, on the assumption you're in a similar situation. Obviously if you're from a developing country with poor access to medication, that does change the perspective.

>I promise you that not sleeping with someone who‚Äôs got a confirmed case of HIV is even more effective

And what about those that don't know? With the likelihood of a high viral load as a result. Or those that don't disclose? Your ignorant stigma can mean you're discriminating against a zero risk (a person with undetectable virus load) but not an unknown risk (and potentially a high risk). That's not logical. And so you're continuing to contribute to the stigma around HIV rather than using your brain, and logic. 

>Y‚Äôall are fucking wild lmao if you think it‚Äôs not such a big deal

It depends what specifically we are talking about. Of course HIV is a huge deal. Sleeping with a HIV+ person with an undetectable viral load, not a big deal whatsoever.

>you are more than welcome to go and stop wearing a condom and to sleep with as many strangers as you can

That's not what I'm saying, as I'm sure you know really. That would be stupid, not everybody gets tested, people lie, some people (known or unknown) have a high viral load. So no I'm not suggesting that. Although if you were going to do that, taking PrEP would reduce your risk from HIV to zero even doing that.

>I choose to not sleep with people who have it

Again, back to a previous paragraph. Your stigma around HIV means you would chose not to sleep with somebody who presents no risk to you whatsoever (HIV+, undetectable), yet sleep with people who represent an unknown risk. And on a related topic, a HIV+ person with an undetectable viral load is likely to getting regular checkups for other STD's as well, so is probably the safest person you could choose to sleep with. But yet again, you'd rather go with the unknown risk. Ignorance is...bliss? 

>That‚Äôs a choice I‚Äôm making to protect my health

Then you're doing a terrible job of it. Your ignorance and stigma around HIV means you're poorly assessing risk. You state you would objectively decline a zero risk partner who has disclosed their HIV+ status, over an unknown risk partner. All because of that word, HIV. And you wonder why so many people chose not to disclose their status. 

I'm not going to respond to everything you said because you keep talking about this disease you're going to catch, when the example I was using in my reply to you was a HIV+ person with an undetectable viral load. You cannot catch HIV from that person. If it was a person with a high or unknown viral load then absolutely I wouldn't blame you in the slightest avoiding unprotected sex with that person, but that's not the conversation we are having.

And thank you for the downvote, despite me contributing to the conversation, contrary to [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette). You'll note I didn't downvote you even though I disagree with you.

Edit: Oh and I'm HIV- despite sleeping with multiple HIV+ partners. Somehow I've protected my heath and avoided catching that 'deadly disease'. How could that possibly be? Probably something to do with being educated rather than ignorant, not subscribing to HIV stigma and actually understanding risk and when it doesn't exist.

Firstly, HIV can spread through semen, and obvious there is going to be a lot more semen transferred from the penis into the anus, rather than from the anus into the penis.

And secondly, the ways for that fluid to enter the body are very different. The entire anal lining will allow the infection to pass into the blood stream. Whereas for the most part the infection will won't be able to penetrate the skin of the penis.

Think of it this way, what is more likely to pass an infection, pouring infected fluids onto unbroken skin or pouring them into the anus?",1647433138.0,3

You are not limited to only protease inhibitors as a treatment option. There are 7 drug classes for HIV medications. For example the new long acting monthly injection is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Side effects are typically not any worse than any other medication a regular person would be taking for something like high blood pressure. Studies have shown a life expectancy for HIV+ males between 77 and 87 years old depending on when ART was started. CDC says average USA life expectancy is 79 years for males without HIV so not entirely sure where you are getting the reduced lifespan from. 

Lets compare that to what we know about COVID. The possibility of long term side effects if it doesn't kill you. Possibility of life long disability. This could include loss of taste/smell, permanent lung damage, 'brain fog', chronic fatigue, chronic joint pain, etc. You can experience these long term effects even if you only experienced mild symptoms. COVID also caused the biggest drop in the US life expectancy since WWII. COVID can kill in many different ways such as organ failure, blood clots, asphyxiation, etc. 

To address the 'finding someone to have sex with you' part. I am happily married so that isn't really a concern. If you are HIV positive but have an undetectable viral load then you cannot spread the virus to others. Not to mention PrEP exists which has been proven to be effective at preventing infection. A gay man trying to find sex is probably the easiest thing. A gay man trying to find sex while HIV positive is still easier than a straight guy trying to find sex. I could download gay apps right now and put that I am HIV positive on it and still be able to find *at least* 1 hookup before the end of the day.

Got a call from my cashier that there was some confusion about the price of a pressure washer so I head up to see if I can sort out what's going on. The pressure washer is ringing up one price but the customer is insisting the shelf says it's several hundred dollars cheaper. Well, that can't be right, even if it were an expired sale tag (which I know it isn't), the sale price would not be that big of a price difference. So I have the customer take me over to where he found it on the shelf (fortunately the pressure washers happen to be on an aisle right next to the register so this isn't a pain in the ass) and he points to the spot and the shelf label does indeed have a much lower price. Something feels off so I take a closer look at the product and the shelf. It takes a moment but I realize the spot he found the washer in isn't the proper home location, it was for another washer of the same brand but lesser power. So I tell him I can't possibly honor the shelf price because it's not mislabeled, the product was just in the wrong spot. If you look at the label it clearly states it's for a different pressure washer (it even has pictures). He starts ranting about false advertising and this is fraud and how he's gonna call the cops and I'm like, dude, I can't help it if a customer picks an item off the shelf and puts it in the wrong spot after deciding they don't want it after all, that doesn't entitle you to get the product for a $200+ discount. Not to mention, how do I control for customers who might intentionally put an item in the wrong spot to try and force a discount like he might be trying to do?

#Establishments Where Prices Are Displayed on the Shelves

##_Compensation in the event of an error_

This policy provides for compensation if the price shown at the cash register is higher than the price displayed in the store. The merchant must:

* give you the item for free, if it costs $10 or less;
* sell you the item at the price displayed, minus a $10 discount, if it costs more than $10.

You are not entitled to compensation if the error is in your favour, meaning if the price shown at the cash register is lower than the price displayed in the store.

What Scope says, is that if the price at the register rings up higher than the listed price on the shelf. You get $10 off the product +  the difference, or, the product is free (if under $10).

This policy is in place to show consumers that the company is not trying to scam you by listing an item for $7 but ringing it up at $9 in hopes that you don't notice.

Start with an onion and add some carrots and potatoes... or serve over rice or with some bread.  Also makes the human meal much more nutritionally balanced.
Or if you only have dried pasta and canned tomatoes (always have those in the pantry) make a human meat sauce for the pasta.
And, if you have time, you can make human bone broth which will add nutrition and  flavor to any soup or stew you make in the future.
If you have a meat grinder, you can make human burgers and add a filler like bread or corn flakes or even oatmeal so that each quarter pound burger only actually uses about a 5th pound of actual meat.
No matter what you do with human meat, make sure to use ample dried herbs and spices - human meat is very mild  and needs the extra help to bring out the flavor.  But you can do wonders even with just salt on human meat if you do it correctly (add salt early). 
When you're cooking for 25 people on a budget (especially during these difficult economic times) you really need to think on creative ways to extend your human meat beyond half a day.
