Returned glass is incredibly critical to the flow of goods. I can't state this enough. Cans are so very expensive, wasteful, and very expensive to recycle and waste a lot of potable drinking water, electricity, and resources to recycle. Cans are also lined with BPA in Canada. Bottles are super easy and cheap to reuse and without the Beer Store recycling and reusing program, the Canadian beer industry would struggle.. I'd also like to point out that the metrics that the beer industry provides data analysts, such as myself, is second to none in aiding us to make decisions on our products. LCBO, grocery, do not prpvide anywhere near the level of detail and metrics as to how our products move. Nore are either very helpful when it comes to accommodation.

947,funny,Boarding Order,,1647775412.0,300,4371,0.97,PM_MY_OTHER_ACCOUNT,"That's absolutely false. Plenty of planes exist with comfortable, roomy seats and plenty of storage space. They're called private/charter planes. They're just too expensive for the average person to use. The reason commercial airlines use planes that are designed to accommodate the maximum amount of passengers, rather than maximize passenger comfort and convenience, is because that's the only way to keep prices within an affordable range and still make a profit. 


The cost of flying a commercial jet from point A to point B is roughly the same, regardless of the number of passengers, for the airline (relative to the size of the plane). To make a profit, they either have to charge more per ticket or sell every seat on the plane. This is partly why some airlines offer multiple classes of tickets. Some planes have a limited number of roomier, more comfortable seats for customers who are willing to pay extra for them. The reason the entire plane isn't designed like first class is because there's more demand for economy class. There are more people who would rather sit in a cramped middle seat and save money than people who are willing to pay more for more space in their seat. If you have enough money, you can charter a private plane and never have to worry about being uncomfortable on a plane.",1647798778.0,1

Getting passengers on/off the plane is by far the longest part of turnaround for a flight. For the average plane, like A340 or 737, loading/unloading cargo only takes around 15 minutes, and cleaning is usually only 5-10 minutes or so (might be more for Covid, but I doubt it) unless there is something extreme to be cleaned.  Fueling usually only took 10-15 minutes.  And those can all be done at the same time.  It takes 15-20 minutes to get people off of a plane, and 30-45 to get more back on.

When fueling, in most cases, we would only add enough fuel to reach the destination (plus a reserve), it costs a lot of money to move thousands of pounds of fuel through the air.

They are a bit time consuming to make, but super tasty.  I bring homemade kale chips often to pot-lucks.  

If you ever try to make them, even in a conventional oven:

* buy the biggest leaf kale you can find (less effort per chip)
* devein the kale, wash and dry, cut into 3"" pieces.
* Add olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne to taste, toss to distribute.
* spread out on a cookie sheet, or better yet a tight grate of some sort to allow better air flow
* cook for about 20 minutes at 280F ~ checking for crispness and ensuring no burned parts

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1647779690.0,31

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

I just cut out the part with her hands and hung it in my room for a while. I want to cut off yours, too. My name is Yoshikage Kira. I've killed 48 women with beautiful hands up to now.

1718,AskReddit,What does having a dick feel like?,,1647723811.0,7455,20549,0.81,cakeba,"Dick skin is less sensitive to tactile input than most other skin on the body. Textures and such are more or less lost of the shaft. Much less sensitive to that kind of stuff than the skin on the back of one's hand. The shaft itself is also not super sensitive. It's more ""numb"" than other parts of the body. It gets more sensitive around the head. The inside of the foreskin is very sensitive, almost like skin that's been rubbed raw. If you touch it with dry, salty fingers, it would burn a little bit. It's a lot like the insides of cheeks or the insides of your lips that rests against your teeth. 

On uncircumcized men such as me, the head is the epicenter of sensory reception. The skin is extremely sensitive to texture and pressure; it is uncomfortable to even run dry hand skin across its surface and I can feel my fingerprint if I touch it directly. I imagine it's somewhat comparable to the sensitivity of the clitoris; I  have been with some clitoris owners who would jolt if I touched the clit directly with my tongue. On the same note, it's almost electrical-shock-feeling to me when someone licks the head of my dick, enough to make me jitter a little bit. 

That's when it's hard, anyways. When it's soft, the sensitivity is still the same, but the form factor hugely impacts the way everything feels. When hard, it hurts to bend it more than a few degrees in any direction. When soft, it can literally be rolled up and stored inside my body. It can be twisted a full 360 degrees easily. A solid flick would be painful, but gentle taps wouldn't feel like very much at all. (THE PENIS. EVEN GENTLE TAPS ON A TESTICLE WILL CAUSE A DULL ACHE. A SOLID FLICK TO A TESTICLE WOULD BE PAINFUL.)

But when not in use, it pretty much disappears from my consciousness. There are times where, if I've been sitting still for a while, I would not be able to tell you without touching it which way it was lying in my pants. It's almost octopus-like in its squishability and ability to just lie/squish/nest wherever it ends up when sitting. This is further demonstrated by sports underwear or cycling chamois; if I'm going for a bike ride, I can lift everything up in front and the tightness of the garment more or less just squishes it into a coherent bundle of squishy genital. And I can forget it exists.",1647739315.0,3991

It’s a light tickling pleasant sensation. Lightly flick your nipple back and forth with your finger, it’s a similar sensation and you can feel the “small member” (nipple) get harder and have a relationship to that pleasant sensation at the base where the nipple meets the breast. You get those similar sensations on the dick, although it’s a bigger area then the nipple, and (for me at least) u initially feel it like that under the penis head mostly (the light tickling pleasant sensation) and when it gets hard it’s like a larger/longer/wider version of the nipple getting hard…

When u insert into a vagina all the way so the base of the penis and surrounding body area is touching her body area, u feel a sense of relief and fullness… you feel fulfilled and then the pleasant sensation isn’t as much under the penis head anymore, but instead more focused on the base of the penis. It’s more a fulfillment when body’s are completely touching while inside, but also a little pleasant ticklishness at the base now (but not as sensitive there like it was under the head). However, when u move outward from the vagina u then again get a pleasant feeling under the head again. 

Now u want to move back and forth… As the loose skin moves up and down you get a less ticklish (but still slight tickles), yet a more amplified intense fulfillment at both the base and just under the head. As the strokes go back and forth, so do the amplified fulfillment sensations move between the penis base to under the penis head. Back and forth where u feel fulfillment on each side (base & under head). U go back and forth to feel more and more fulfillment, and fulfillment again. U like to go faster sometimes to feel the alternating fulfillment. Sometimes it’s nice to go slower to draw out fulfillment on each side. 

When u ejaculate there’s an overwhelming electric vibrations type of sensation throughout a lot of the body and in the head/scalp… a relief type of sensation like a really good massage just released a ton of tension. In the penis, upon ejaculation, it’s as if u just finished the end of a piss that was backed up for far too long, another sense of relief... In general, it’s a large tension release with a type of after glow… the penis is then really sensitive and soft with mostly a loss of ability to immediately harden back up because the sensitivity is more prevalent, but without the associated pleasantness.",1647757080.0,20

For the most part, you both walk in the same direction and sometimes you forget he's walking there with you.

Other times, his attention could be pulled to something.

It could be the confident strut of an attractive woman, the reveal of a veiny forearm as a man rolls up his sleeve, or even an especially curvy stick. Every dog is into different things.

When this happens, the dog will pull at your leash (the leash in this analogy is attention/focus/self control) making it harder to pay attention to what you need to do.

The more excited the dog becomes, the more he tugs at the leash, and the harder it is to make rational decisions.

However, the better trained the dog (self control, social awareness, etc.) the less of an issue this will be for the owner.",1647755896.0,9

My wife became furious with me one night because I woke her up and was unable to stop laughing for around an hour.   I wasn’t even watching it anymore.. the image would just flash as I closed my eyes and I would start cracking up again.


It’s a stage panel at some event… no context..
Just some older dude going to cross his legs and I guess he smushed his balls in the process.  

Facial expression of sharp pain and he uncrosses just legs quickly.

Just that mundane motion to get more comfortable coming back to bite you.  It fucking destroyed me.

The crease running the length of the ball sack in the center is where a vagina would have been created if your chromosomes in the womb ended up differently. The male penis is just a woman's clitoris growing outward.

Your balls are roughly equivalent to a woman's ovaries but outside the body instead of inside. Men just don't utilize the internal space for a uterus.

Fallopian tubes are Vas Deferens. It's all similar piping but women get the shit show that is menstruation while us dudes get...not that. Instead we get a pleasure center if excited known as the Prostate. It helps to make what we know as Pre-Cum, and it feels really good if touched gently.

The base of your balls to your asshole, aka the ""taint"", is roughly equivalent to the small distance between a female vagina and asshole.

Human anatomy is cool, disgusting, weird and awesome if people care to learn a bit about it.

There's been several comments saying it's annoying that anyone can tell when you're aroused... but that's not always true. The angle of an erection varies just as much as the length and girth. 

For some men, an erection points straight forward perpendicular to their body and makes that stereotypical ""tent"" in the pants. 

For others (like me) it points almost straight up, so that if they stand up while naked it will be only 10 or 20 degrees away from parallel with their torso. With reasonably tight underwear an erection is just a slight bulge in the crotch, and combined with loose enough pants it's almost completely unnoticeable with an average sized dick.",1647753453.0,47

Other examples of raphes include the line ridge running from the front to the back of the roof of your mouth, and the frenulum of the tongue (the line of tissue that joins your underside of the tongue to the bottom of your mouth).  

The frenulum of the penis, the bit on the underside of the glans (the head) which connects or connected the foreskin to the shaft of the penis, is exactly the _same_ raphe as the one on your balls.

2001,AskReddit,What does having a dick feel like?,,1647723811.0,7455,20549,0.81,PM_ME_PARR0TS,"Yep. And hormones play an underratedly huge part in how all these sexual bits look and behave. 

Not even just in utero. When trans guys talk about ""bottom growth"", that specifically refers to testosterone hormone therapy actually changing the clitoris into an apparent small penis - which of course still lacks an internal urinary/seminal passage, but otherwise behaves (and in most ways appears) eerily similar to a cis dick. 

If we're lucky and get results on the large end, we can have PIV sex like any other guy.

Another funny detail - feeling physical attraction with a generally female hormonal profile affects a much wider area. It can feel shivery in the pit of your stomach. Really sensitive on the skin.

But with a generally male hormonal profile, shit tends to become a lot more localized. It's all about the dick. More intense, but much less full-body.

Just some interesting discoveries from my edge-case personal experience that have been echoed back from other people and resources over the years too.

Genitals largely having the same fundamental pipes is a pretty neat topic that people don't talk about all that often, tbh.",1647762885.0,139

Hot AF in 400BC, not so much today. Great for running, horrible for gym showers/being naked around others in general when not aroused. 

I’ve had a few instances in life when I’ve sat down for a dump and because my dick feels the need to be included in everything, I have to pee a lil first but because mine rides high and tight, it’s somehow lines up perfectly to piss between the seat ring and bowl rim if I rest my elbows on my knees as my boy eggs tighten up to hide from the cold air of the bowl below. They literally lifted it up and aimed it to ruin my day without my knowledge.

It is the male ego’s antithesis of having your dick go kerplunk in the toilet water. 

Oh well, I’d rather piss between the lines than have saggy balls that go plop in the bowl like two soggy Yorkshire tea bags ready for the compost heap.

Edit; I guess I should point out I’m American, I.e.  circumcised. I don’t have the natural anteater’s snout/forskin thing to work with aim wise.

So I was 12 or 13 playing in a baseball tourney somewhere out of town. In between the sometimes hours-long breaks between games, we’d play pickup soccer games to pass the time. Anyway, a ball gets passed to me that I just can’t quite get to, I turn around to follow the ball and as soon as I do I get hit SQUARE in the goddamn nuts with the ball… as soon as the ball was past me the defender just tried to boot it down the field, right into my goddamn nuts. I freeze. Everyone else seemed to freeze too, and I felt as if they all did the ‘oooooohhhhhh!!’ thing that we all do when someone gets hit square in the goddamn nuts… and I just keep waiting for the pain… but it doesn’t come.

Externally we resemble females, but female internal organs do not develop until hormones kick in during foetal development, much the same way the penis and scrotum do.

Ovaries and testicles start out as a neutral organ, in the same position as ovaries, descending for males shortly after birth.

Sometimes these changes do not occur entirely though and a child is left somewhere between what is phenotypically male or female, which we've come to coin as intersex.

What's interesting is that this neutral state can develop into a fully grown child at birth and live a relatively normal life without fully developing into either female or male. They will however appear female and nobody will be the wiser until they reach their teens or have a pelvic exam and notice they're unable to have periods, nor do they have a cervix.

Multiple causes of intersex development exist, not purely limited to chromosomal disorders but in the majority of cases it seems to be the hormones or the genes responsible for the hormone receptors.",1647765091.0,24

She was a bully, she pressured other people into telling her the truth and used it to emotionally abuse them. If you lied to her, she qould use that against you too.

Lying is a defensive social skill for when someone pressures you for information that you should not trust them with and refusal to answer would reveal that information. Sometimes you have to lie to protect the secrets of someone that trusts you.

Don't trust someone who tells you never to lie to them, that's a privilege they have to earn from you.

Lying to someone when you should trust them is bad, it just creates trust issues for them. Lying to deceive and trick someone for personal gain is bad. Lying to protect yourself or other people from someone untrustworthy is okay.

On the whole, most Europeans know about American greetings and that more emphasis is placed on being genially welcoming. 

It’s interesting (to me at least) how different phrases operate. “Howdy” is a contraction of “how are you doing” but no one would ever see it as a genuine question. It’s common in Britain to ask, “y’alright” as a greeting and hear the same word back. German also has, “na?”  

But yeah, for some reason the phrasing of “how are you” just seems so genuine that it’s difficult not to answer honestly. That, and the fact that as far as I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong) there’s a bit more emphasis in American professionalism of keeping that chin held high, and that team spirit is to say things like, “doing great!” or maybe sarcastically saying, “living the dream!” And that to actually answer, “haven’t sleep well and feeling about down but I got this!” May be see as slightly counter intuitive to the team concept?

The Witcher 3 has probably the best original soundtrack of anything to come out for many years. Those folk musicians really knocked it out of the park recording that. I listen to it all the time. It's far superior to the score they use in the Netflix series.

If you like those you should also check out Divinity Original Sin II OST, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Tetris Effect is another overlooked one.

Older: Beyond Good and Evil has great music. Don't skip Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross if you like the Final Fantasy soundtracks.

Retro: A game called Ninja Gaiden for the old NES has one of the best 8-bit soundtracks. It was the first game with cinematic cutscenes. Legacy of the Wizard (Dragon Slayer 4) is great but it's hard to find. And of course the Castlevania series has excellent music throughout (If you like to brood in the darkness). Symphony of the Night is a good place to start. Honorable mention for Sonic the Hedgehog series and Super Metroid. 

An old PC series from the 90's called Wing Commander has really standout music as well. If you like metal, the Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries soundtrack is another memorable one from the days of yore that few know about. That was one of the games where you could put the CD in and skip track 01 and the rest were all music tracks. There's a more recent game called Undertale that has an excellent retro-style chiptune soundtrack, as well.",1647733491.0,255

Fast forward several years later, there's a holiday gathering at my house. My grandma had passed a couple months before, and we were all in our feels about not having her present for the holidays. This turns into bringing out old photo albums and sharing memories and I bust out the trusty ol' camcorder to rewatch some home movies from when she was around. Family is a little misty-eyed, but enjoying the show. 

Then comes a point in the video where my cousins and I were hanging out and we started talking mad shit about grandma. She was a wonderful lady, but ya know how sometimes when you're around someone a lot they kinda get on your nerves and you have to vent to someone? Well, that's what we were doing in the video and me being the genius I am, recorded this entire bitch-fest. The language got pretty colorful and some tea was definitely being spilled.

As this is going on, I'm desperately trying to find buttons to either turn it off or fast forward but my brain decided to revert back to the very first time I used a VCR and in my panic I couldn't do shit. Finally managed to at least pause it and my entire family is just silently staring at me and my cousins are looking on in absolute horror. The tension could've been cut with a knife and the disdain was palpable.

Then, grandpa, who had been mostly silent the entire evening, launched into the biggest belly-laugh that I hadn't heard for the better part of a year. Which started a chain reaction of laughter that I'm so grateful for. What I thought would be my excommunication from the family turned out to be one of our fondest memories and I feel like our family became even closer that day.

So, keep the memories close, no matter how cringey they may be.

Sorry for writing a book. I just felt like sharing. RIP grandma",1647753617.0,99

In my industry its ""Tongs vs Hooks"".

Some people argue that Snake Tongs hurt snakes by breaking their ribs or injuring their spines, and that you should only ever hook-and-tail them with Snake Hooks.

IMHO, most people who do a snake handling course will likely only see one in the wild months later, and unless they're actively doing snake relocations for their communities on a regular basis, they would have lost the skills and experience they picked up using Snake Hooks by them, making the situation much more dangerous.

Well-made Snake Tongs are safer for amateurs, and won't hurt the snake. I'm affiliated with a company that trains thousands of people on snake handling every year, and they've never had an instance of a snake being injured by a course attendee using a Snake Tong. And keep in mind, these are often people who are scared & nervous about approaching a live snake for the first time.

Once you have some experience under your belt you can switch to Snake Hooks, since they stress the animals less. For example, when I do snake photography I exclusively use hooks, but then I handle hundreds of snakes every year and I'm comfortable doing so safely.",1647765832.0,3

Power BI is more intuitive and beginner friendly: floating charts in your dashboard, every chart is a filter on all dashboard charts by default, there's a chart marketplace in case you legitimately need a word map, and it's very familiar if your organization has a decades-long love affair with Excel. And the power-user tools are there if you can only use Power BI.

Tableau has a steeper learning curve and is less intuitive. I think I spent 30 minutes trying to get two charts on the same sheet before I realized the dashboard logic. And then got a headache trying to arrange two charts on a dashboard. And then ragequit my session when charts on the same dashboard didn't filter each other.

I can't seem to find elegant solutions for a lot of basic stuff, like formatting the date in a dashboard title without mashing multiple Datename expressions together, but a few months in with it and I have a mild preference for Tableau because it plays nice with my SAS extracts and it gives you a bit more control (at the expense of ease of use, of course).",1647763514.0,43

This is a good explanation. You have a system for detecting if the sun explodes. There is a 1 in 36 chance that it lies. 

Frequentists look purely at the current data set. The experiment says the sun exploded. There is only a 1 in 36 chance that is false and a 35/36 chance its true. So it must be true. P is the inteval that describes how confident they are. 

So frequentists might say - its likely the sun exploded.

Bayesians look at prior events and apply probablity to the event. That is the probability of the sun randomly exploding is very very very low. One ina trillion trillion. It has never exploded before. We know what causes suns to explode. We know thats not happening to the sun. The fact the sun wont explode modifies their result. Its more likely that the machine rolled double 6. 

You might think great, just use baysiean! But it requires data on the probablity of events which requires a lot of computing power.",1647763339.0,113

4546,AskReddit,"What is the ""coke vs. pepsi"" of your industry?",,1647740103.0,2598,1640,0.96,Senecarl,"Best explained with a (simplified) scenario...

There are 20 lovely ladies in a room with you. You ask 5 of them on dates and 2 say yes.

The frequentist on your left shoulder says 'Yo, that's 40%! Keep asking and we can expect to get 6 more dates.'

Bayes on your right shoulder says 'Fool, let's break this down. What percentage of FYTs you think like you? Now you're a solid 6/10 so let's say 40%. And given that some lovely lady likes you, let's say she agrees to a date 70% of the time. I know you're thinking it should be more like 100% but quit your crying, ladies make their choices based on other factors too that we are not privileged to observe. So you can go talk to the other 15 beautiful creatures up in here but you won't get 6 more dates, I say you'll get 4.2, most likely 4. You got lucky with those first 5.'

The benefit of the frequentist approach is that we didn't need to estimate anything, we just went on what we calculated in the sample. The drawback is that the sample can be biased and there's no sense-check - we just follow the numbers.

The benefit of the Bayesian approach is that we feed in reasonable estimates based on prior knowledge. The drawback is that those risk being subjective.

TL;DR frequentist needs no additional assumptions but can be biased, Bayes requires additional assumptions but is closer to reality.

Edit: Smarter person below pointed out that Bayes has a little more to say...
""MAYBE you got lucky with those first 5. However, it could be that our original estimates were off. We thought it would be about 28% and now observation suggests 40%. So let's update our estimate to 34%, meaning 5/15 people expected instead of 4/15.""

Edit 2: Another smarter person said it would be better in future not to choose dating for examples. Apologies to anyone else it annoys, hopefully it doesn't interfere too much with the calculations.",1647766109.0,155

2-ongoing improvements to the software based on client requests. Can’t easily connect to a data source this month? Check back in three and it will probably be there. Want to create custom visualizations and/ or leverage Python? Have fun—it’s available or in preview by popular request.

That's why I'm absolutely loving the fact that we've discovered these hidden doors that only open as after a specific amount of hits, or specific action. First off, it'll make the fans go nuts, but more important the fromsoft fan base has also gotten coddled by their experience of multiple fromsoft titles.

I had so much fun on the PC, N64, PSOne and PS2 (and the SNES/GB/earlier era stuff), but by the time PS3 rolled around I became primarily a PC-only gamer and really found that level of enjoyment from my formative years. There were exceptions of course, but few and far between. That is until the Switch and BotW came along. Now I'm only on PC/Switch and still very rarely get that wonder.

I think that a big part of the cause is that in the pre-micro-transaction/loot-box/pre-order/cosmetic-DLC/monthly-subscription era, developers focused on fun game design first, and money came as a result. Nowadays it's finances first and fun second. That's why the few games where you see the devs truly put their hearts into the game such as The Witcher III, BotW, Hades, Stardew Valley, CrossCode, Civilization VI, etc are the only ones I've find myself really enjoying and finding this sense of wonder in.",1647798684.0,1

The main ""story"" campaign can be completed on around 30 hours. You are constantly getting new cars, but you receive fairly few credits to purchase new cars. Mind you, the gift cars are generally unusable and cannot be sold for credits. There also exists a roulette system for daily rewards that low rolls in the order of 90% of the time. To give you an idea, you generally get 2 or 3 credit options, a random upgrade part, and a car on the roulette. The lowest credit (that you almost always get) is perhaps 2000-10000 credits. Sport tires are just short of 5000 credits. The game has a serious economy issue (in other words).

 There were a few races that unlock late in the story campaign that could be used to farm credits. One particular method was probably 5 times better than any other method because it awarded close to 100k credits and could be completed in around 3 minutes. The update 1.07 nerfed that payout by like 80%. The entire system was offline for 30 plus hours because they discovered a bug during the rollout of 1.07. There was 1 tweet that alerted us to extended server maintenance, but it was really just to provide time to push out patch 1.08.

1. If the game is free than let it be (unless it's pay to win)
2. I'm old enough to remember buying map packs that you'd get to play for a few months at most if it wasn't for cod or halo. Because these map packs were sold separately they couldn't toss these maps into regular playlists and they always had to separate them to keep things smooth. Remember people dropping bank for a new zombies map every cycle? I do and that shit was way more expensive then saying, ""fuck it! I'll buy a ten dollar battle pass along with everyone,"" else and you tend to get far more gameplay content in return.

Halo Infinite got backlash for progression and they proceeded to give vastly more XP for playing and reduced store prices across the board.

GT7 is going in the opposite direction. They literally not only defended their MTX but proceeded to nerf payout rates, meaning more MTX focus. I have never ever seen a game actually buff MTX💀

I hopped on last night to grind a bit only to realized it was now offering 35k, and with a clean racing bonus it's about 50k. 

Mind you. I should note even in the used car market where rare cars can be upwards of 700k. Hell, I had an invite to get a Carrera GT which costs 2.3 million. I have half of that and knew it was going to take some time to grind but now it's going to be even longer.

It's frustrating that they nerfed the rewards. Extremely frustrating because like me and others why the hell do we want to shell out 20$ of our own money for 2 million credits when the average new fancy car costs upwards of that. Insane.

So let’s take the famous Halo Infinite example. I have a buddy that put thousands of hours into Halo 3. Never played the campaign. To play the multiplayer he wanted to, he had to buy a full $60 copy of Halo 3, while with Infinite it cost him nothing. He doesn’t care about cosmetics at all, so he literally gets the same enjoyment for free. 

To go a little less extreme, if he didn’t completely not care about cosmetics, he could still buy $10 worth or whatever of them and come out $50 ahead. It basically allows you to commit as much money as you feel like to the game. 

The problems come in when developers either institute pay to win or neuter the games content in the free version. But, it can work and be beneficial to the consumer as well.",1647790319.0,-1

That is literally what I replied to. Asking what about the game is unfinished and not liking the MTX doesn't count as unfinished. Since nothing is locked behind them and everything can be earned in game.

​ All you have done is show you didn't even pay attention before complaining.

&#x200B;

>​ People are pissed because it takes like 2 years and daily play to get stuff in the game that you can just buy with real money (aka, pay to win). It's bullshit.

And how is this pay to win with a game that has single player and multiplayer? Why do you need every car in the game rather then just specific cars?

That isn't being incomplete that is having a different idea of how the game works. Much in the same way World of Warcraft being an online MMORPG is different from Warcraft the RTS strategy games.

&#x200B;

>​ WoW? Really? How about we look at the modern competition? Apex, HALO, Fortnite all offer new content with the only monetization being skins.

Yeah you get in game currency and use it to buy skins you can't earn in game. Meanwhile GT7 you buy in game currency to buy cars you can earn in game.  Notice the difference? You can actually earn those cars by playing the game while you need to buy skins to get them in Apex, Halo and Fortnite.

&#x200B;

You want a car on GT7 you grind a bit and it is yours. You want a skin in Halo, Fortnite or Apex you best break out the credit card.

The companies love the ticket sales and audience draw, and it's the best advertising for buying other symphony tickets - just hearing the orchestra live in the hall, maybe you'll be intrigued by something else coming up.

Most seasoned orchestral players are fairly tired of the usual symphonies (nobody tires of Bach), so as long as it's for just a week or so, it doesn't get too repetitive. Best seats are the ones where you can watch the screen when you're not playing!

The drawback is it's so mechanical. The music has to be timed exactly to the actions on the screen, so is conducted to a clicktrack. The conductors who tour with these kind of shows who do it a hundred times and are not allowed any creative variation have the saddest part of the job.",1647759846.0,12

5853,music,Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out [Rock],,1647781957.0,81,1080,0.91,PM-me-favorite-song,"""I love it too! Though to me, it has specific intro-energy.

you know, the initial **NAMANAAWWWWW**, which explodes but fades out, and then comes the soft *nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu*, and it is joined by the voice, saying ""*so if you're lonely...*"", while the *nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu* continues, and goes a bit down in pitch, into *na na na na na na na na*, into *no no no no no no no no,* but also, the... hi-hat? --idk, im not a drummer-- comes and accentuates it, so it's more of a ^(ts)*ono* ^(ts)*ono* ^(ts)*ono* ^(ts)*ono.* And is that... is that a single **bmbmm** I hear from the kick drum? He's gone now. No, he's back! The ^(ts)*ono* ^(ts)*ono* ^(ts)*ono* ^(ts)*ono* and the lyrics ""*and if you leave here...""* are joined, properly this time, by the **bmbmm bmm bmm bmm bmm bmm bmm bmm**, all building up... building up... And, understandably, Alex has an orgasm: ""*aaaaaAAAAAaaah"",* right in time for the cimbals to kick in! *chickachickachickaTISH! A*nd again! *chickachickachickaTISH!* And you expect them again, the gentle yet agitated cimbals, but no! Instead, you're smacked in the face with the same rhythm, but much more powerful, with a true drum **DAKKADAKKADAKKADAK**! And Alex's orgasm is seemingly repeated, and fades out... ""*wiiiith youuuu...""* and, with the fading of the feeling, the instruments all slowly fizzle out and lose their potency, along with Alex' and my instrument... But, this can't be it. This sexy train has barely left the station. And therefore, rather than leave us with a premature climax, the entire band decides to toughen up and continue the song, as not only we, but also they, would be disappointed in themselves. So, they slow down, and down, until they find their new rhythm, and stick with it. The drums and guitar lead. **NAM. NAM. NAME-NE-NAME-NO-NAM. NAM.** Stick with this, until the other instruments have collected and composed themselves again -- and the drums mark the true and proper start of the song, followed by the well known **NEE NAA NUNU NAA NAA NAA**. **NEE NAA NUNU NAA NAA NAA. NEE NAA NUNU NAA NAA NAA. NIMA NIMA NIMA NIMA NIMA NUMANAMANA!**

So yes. The intro is great, possibly their best intro ever. But it is just that, an intro. It serves its purpose honourably. It is the amuse-bouche, the foreplay, for the rest of the song.

Also, we're not judging Alex here. Happens to the best of us.""

If you’ve spent any time in any social services field that overlaps with domestic violence: this is all (minus the fame/publicity aspect) absolutely textbook behavior that will likely continue to escalate. 

If his stated goals are to…be around his kids more and/or get her back, his behavior is achieving the opposite. if he had real friends, they would get him to stop it to not harm himself further, but he doesn’t surround himself with people who aren’t yes men and is shocked when people are like, dude, you are the villain in this story and this story involves KIM KARDASHIAN who I think MOST of us loathe! They had a prenup, there’s no reason for the divorce to take this long, but he’s being a controlling creepy ex. 

Honestly, I’m furious because I have never ever wanted to be on any side with her and his behavior is all domestic violence warning signs and he’s made me sympathetic to her.

Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.

A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.

Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.

Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'

The detective said ""Robyn F."" then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.

Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'

After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'

Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.

Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.

Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.

Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.

Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.

Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.

She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.

Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.",1647731050.0,1809

The biggest children's movie will win Best Animated, the most viral documentary will be in the discussion for Best Doc, etc.


The best reviewed albums each year are nowhere to be seen in the AOTY discussion, and the best selling are often missing as well. Then they have the ""Best New Artist"" category where for some reason they feel the need to admit to the entire world they haven't been paying attention to the industry at all, so they'll nominate a band like Glass Animals in *2022* as if they haven't been a festival staple for the better part of a decade or Chance the Rapper in 2017 like Acid Rap wasn't one of the most talked about projects of 2013... For anyone that follows the music industry or music journalism, it's just an incredibly frustrating event if you try to pay attention.

If you are the victim of a strangulation in a domestic abuse situation, statistics show you are 800% more likely to be murdered by that same person if you stay with them. The reasoning that I was taught is that a person who is capable of strangling someone is a person who is capable of murder. It is a very, very personal way to kill someone because you are looking them in the eyes and can feel their life slipping away in your hands.

Also, please view the infographic below if you are unsure if you are in a domestic abuse situation. Also know that abuse is not always physical. Just because hands arent being put on you doesnt mean you aren't in a bad situation (verbal abuse, controlling behavior, isolating you from friends and family, controlling what you wear, who you see, etc...)

I divorced him and eventually got my smile back.,,1647780027.0,893,45304,0.83,Jibaro_Suenos,"First off: I'm so so sorry you had to live through this.  No one deserves to be treated like this. Thank you for being brave enough to speak so openly about this. It's important we never sweep these topics under the rug. 

Secondly: as a man, what are ways I can better support and understand my partner, who has lived through exactly this with her previous ex? Like, what MOST helped you during those years after to recollect yourself? My fiancee has an ex-boyfriend who gave her a pair of black eyes the day they broke up.... unfortunately it didn't end there. He's stalked her down and broke her arm, twice, once in 2017 and again in 2020. I've been with her since 2018.  (I should mention that she lives in Mexico and I'm in the US). He's still out there, he even started stalking me when I went down there to visit her last summer. We've tried going to the police to file what's called a ""demanda"" (a formal claim to bring something to court), but since she lives in Mexico the criminal justice system doesn't work like it does in the US and has pretty much gone no where. 

I mean, obviously my intent is to get her out of Mexico as soon as I can, we're working on that. But going back to my question: I find it's difficult for me to talk with my fiancee about these matters because it's still so recent for her and she gets understandably worked up whenever the topic is brought up... she tries SO hard to be strong, and she's the damn strongest person I know, which is one of many reasons why I wanna marry her, but I recognize that she feels like she had a significant amount of her autonomy stolen from her... She tells me often that she doesn't feel like the same person she quite was before, and is in a process of evolution. So I'm just wondering what are ways that you felt have most empowered you in the years since then?",1647788813.0,0

Its sad that the guy will probably continue his way of life and hurt lots of more women before he dies.  There was a show on the radio about a serial woman abuser and he abused several until he met one woman who just said no directly and said either you seek help or im leaving. He did seek help and the abuse stopped. This was just one example and its extremely hard for a woman to do that because abuse doesn't just come on the first date. Its a slow cycle of increasing abuse. That is what makes it so dangerous.

Sorry for the ramblings i just wish that it would be possible to end all domestic abuse. You are strong to get out of it and you look happy. It makes me smile.",1647782157.0,-5

She was very reclusive, almost never left the house. Over the years, my grandma often tried to talk to her and encouraged her to leave her husband, but the woman was just beyond reach. They lived in a small town and the police never did anything. One day my grandma was out working in her garden on her knees and she heard a voice say her name from behind her. She turned to look and the man who lived next door was standing over her. He was bleeding from his chest and fell on top of her. He was a big guy. His wife was standing in her doorway with a gun in her hand. She yelled to my grandma, ""Is he dead!"" My grandma said, ""Yes!"" The woman said, ""Good!"" and went back inside. My grandpa heard my grandma yelling and went out to help get the dead guy off of her. The neighbor did very little time in jail and got off in the end on self-defense with the help of my grandma's testimony. She bought a big RV, got a new boyfriend (a very nice, fun guy), and lived out her last years traveling the country and having the time of her life. She sent my grandma post cards from all the places she went and came to visit her often until my grandma passed. They became close friends. The end.",1647793829.0,-1

It is a very, very personal way to kill someone because you are looking them in the eyes and can feel their life slipping away in your hands.

As a note, its also something that takes a surprisingly long time, movies and whatnot make it seem quick, but it takes several minutes before there's even brain damage, nevermind death. To choke someone to death means they lose consciousness and the attacker continues while the victim isn't fighting back making it far less likely to happen as a crime of passion, not that that should have any bearing on how its treated.",1647792545.0,7

OP is of course extremely brave and strong. If you are living in abuse, that does not mean that you are not brave and strong. Abuse lies. It puts you down and tells you that you aren't brave and strong. You are. Living with what you endure every day takes a huge amount of strength. It is exhausting and you are told lies about yourself constantly so it is easy to feel like you aren't brave and strong. 

Courage is not the biggest barrier to leaving abuse, access to money and resources is. Being able to execute a safety plan and exit often requires these things. There are resources out there, but they are limited and can be difficult to find and navigate especially while in abuse. 

1-800-799-7233 is the hotline. They are there to help you find a resource in you area and/or to talk. Many believe that calling these hotlines will mean they will push you to leave, most don't and they shouldn't. They are there for you to be supportive of whatever circumstance you are in. If you need support, they are a great place to reach out to when you are feeling safe. If you believe your phone may be compromised, you can reach out online or with a trusted friend/ neighbor/co-worker's phone. You are worth support and safety even if someone in your life has done everything they can to take those things away.

They didn’t care.

She was in jail for the weekend.  She got a misdemeanor (because it was the “first offense” despite police having had four previous run-ins with her) and had forced drug and alcohol therapy. Monitored randomly and regularly (only for the first 6 months) to make sure she had nothing in her system.  At one hearing, she had tested positive for alcohol.

They didn’t care.

I had a restraining order, but she used our connected phone plan to pretend to be me with other people.

They didn’t care.

She got half of everything (assets and property) and I didn’t have enough of my “own” money to pay her out right and keep things, so I have to give her a monthly payment until it’s done.

They didn’t care.

Not sure if this was because it was female on male domestic violence (notoriously belittled), but it is what it is.

I am much happier.  I am glad OP is too.

My family was about ten thousand miles away, and they didn't know about a lot of stuff going on. To this day, they don't know everything because I am scared to tell them, out of embarrassment, honestly. Embarrassed that I got myself into that situation, but he was a different person when I met him, most likely a farce until the real him came out. You are right though, even if I did tell them, it would have made the situation worse for me. Abused people are scared. Even if they were to tell someone, and that person confronted the guy, I would feel the wrath of it when they were gone for telling someone. Does that make sense? I know it sounds weird, but that's the mentality. Constructive help is help that can protect you. Legally. Write everything down, keep records of everything that happened and when. With pictures if necessary. And then when you get out, try to stay as far away as possible. Friends and family, cannot really do much by talking about it. Unless someone is really willing to offer protection, then their help is futile and can it make it worse. It still took me a year and a half to get divorced from this guy, because he was playing innocent, and that I was crazy.  Even with all my proof, he had great lawyers and I didn't. I lost everything. And then he got a trailer truck and loaded the entire household into it, including forks and dishware, and moved it into another house. Cleaned me out. The courts wouldn't allow me to change my locks because technically we were still married. I changed them anyway, got an emergency order of protection because he again said he was going to stab me in front of my son, and got the f*** out and hid for a while.

>Her parents and grandparents survived the pol pot regime in Cambodia and the weight of that in her household is probably what made her so insane.

Married a Khmer girl. My age. Born 1986.

Scientist studied survivors of Pol Piggy..

They wanted to see if PTSD could be transferred into offspring. 

My wife remembers as her father hid her in a wicker basket full of beans as the last of the Khmer Rouge rolled down the street in 1990 as UNTAC were taking over. 


The khmer rouge waged war on its own people from 1975 to 1979, until the Vietnamese stepped in..


They continued on as a force until the United Nations TAC took over.  In which time a Khmer rouge leader named Hun Sen, took over as a dictator of Cambodia.  He remains in power to the time of this writing. 

I once did a U turn on my Kawasaki KLX250 in the driveway of Hun Sen's(the dictator) sons driveway.  2 guards ran at me and pointed their AK 47s at me. 

I said "" What's up guys, how are you doing?"" in Khmer.  They just looked at me and this was all over with within 5 seconds.  I drove off and turned right into Monivong Blvd. I think I drive all the way up past Independence monument to the traffic circle and visited my wife for lunch at her work place.  She brought her 2 female co workers along.  Srey Rous and Lahkayna. Spelled wrong of course.  

I could ramble and type on and on of the adventure I had in Cambodia from 2013 to 2018...


As my wife( Cambodian local. Super hero) and I left Kampuchea in late 2017, right before new year.  The Chinese were invading her country. Through building , bribes and invasion of persons.

We watch the main coastal city of Sihanoukville become transformed in a shitty way with 24 months. 

China came in with a fucking force in terms of building their shit. 

They sweep in, raze , and build their shit and then immediately import their citizens in. 

It was scary to watch. War is happening without militaries .",1647795414.0,1

I see so many people shouting that people should rot in jail for this and that forever and get beat up and all this stuff.

Baby daddies don't get alimony; divorced dads do (if they were the lower earner). That stat could also include single mothers who are divorced but were not the higher earning partner, thus are the head of their own household but do not pay alimony.

In married households with or without kids, 23% have the wife as primary breadwinner. In married households with kids where the mother is the higher income earner, only 22% of the fathers did not work (22% of 23% is 5% of marriages). In married households where the father is the higher income earner, 41% of the mothers did not work (41% of 77% is 32% of marriages). [(Source)](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/05/29/chapter-3-married-mothers-who-out-earn-their-husbands/)

I have a friend who turned down alimony because she didn't make much less than her ex and hadn't sacrificed her career for the marriage/children like some spouses do. I hear that's pretty common. Also, the divorce rate has declined a lot for young people (millennials) but has skyrocketed for boomers, so people getting divorced aren't a representative sample of married couples.

This is very obviously photoshopped.

1. This isn't what Arizona plates look like. This is. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle\_registration\_plates\_of\_Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Arizona)Where is the registration tag? (it's covered by the last letter) The part that says ""ARIZONA""? The cactus?
2. There's a faint outline around ADOLPH that lightens the background, likely from cloning letters and trying to duplicate the layer, which they copied in through a box shape. <-- this is what first caught my eye and why I still think it is shopped. Here's what custom plates are available in AZ. It's not right. [https://azdot.gov/content/standard-full-size-6-x-12](https://azdot.gov/content/standard-full-size-6-x-12)
3. Other stickers, most notably in the top left of the truck gate, look shopped as well. Like someone started to try and clone a blue lives matter sticker and the gave up. It is on top of what looks to be a dealer marking that is faintly still visible and was shopped out.
4. The ""police"" in the lower left is hardly visible, but is -- so why isn't the rest of the lettering at this same zoom?
5. There's no proof that this is at a costco fueling station -- not enough context surrounding the image.

Edit: 1) This isn't what Arizona plates look like. This is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Arizona 

Where is the registration tag? (it's covered by the last letter) The part that says ""ARIZONA""? The cactus? 

2) There's a feint outline around ADOLPH that lightens the background, likely from cloning letters and trying to duplicate the layer, which they copied in through a box shape. <-- this is what first caught my eye and why I still think it is shopped. 

Here's what custom plates are available in AZ. It's not right. https://azdot.gov/content/standard-full-size-6-x-12

3) Other stickers, most notably in the top left of the truck gate, look shopped as well. Like someone started to try and clone a blue lives matter sticker and the gave up. It is on top of what looks to be a dealer marking that is faintly still visible and was shopped out. 

4) The ""police"" in the lower left is hardly visible, but is -- so why isn't the rest of the lettering at this same zoom? 

5) There's no proof that this is at a costco fueling station -- not enough context surrounding the image.",1647755284.0,-9

Of course he did. Did all democrats take the vote of some bad people that committed crimes? Of course they did. That’s the crap side of politics.

Yeah, all four of them!

Seriously, though, most cops claim to be in it to help people, but then they either engage in willfully criminal behavior or help cover up that behavior by their fellow officers. Cops will *always* put cops ahead of civilians, because as far as they're concerned every one of us is a potential enemy.

Police in the U.S. kill, on average, around 28.5 people per 10 million every year. That number isn't the highest in the world, but it's the highest in the western world by far. No other western nation has a rate above 10 per 10 million. The U.S. has a higher police killing rate than nations like Colombia, Sudan, Rwanda, Mexico, and Pakistan.

We imprison far more of our population than any other nation on Earth, and the estimated rate of wrongful conviction in the U.S. is between 2%-10%. We have a higher number of wrongfully convicted people in prison than most nations have prisoners in total. Police misconduct is the leading cause of wrongful convictions in the U.S., with more than half of wrongful convictions involving police misconduct.

And police are rarely punished for their misconduct, because they protect one another at all costs. As long as cops continue to protect one another from the consequences of their illegal, unethical, and immoral actions, there are no good cops. Defund them, and then hold them to the high standard of behavior they should be held to, and imprison the ones who break the law.",1647748017.0,4

This is a typical lower middle class upgrade or starter home. When built, this is a big house outside North America.
It's a step up for the generation it was built for.  That second story & garage represents the advantages of simply being white Al Bundy in America after WW2:  lots of resources, high demand, reduced competition and sophisticated infrastructure & education systems which are able to grow with demand... thanks to collecting and spending taxes.    This further fuels a hungry economy, widening it's effects among the public & increasing incomes - making a bigger down payment and a bigger mortgage payment for a bigger house possible for millions more people.   Al Bundy has no skills.  Just like the owners of the shoe companies, Al didn't build the road, grow the wilderness,  develop Conservation techniques in a State College, or get a GI bill loan.  But he benefited from all of it with cheaper, faster housing,  enjoying a higher quality of life than the people who did build it.

Now we can compare this home cost in all sorts of revealing ways.

I'll give you Family Guy (although it's been pointed out elsewhere here that their money issues are just part of the gag), but the other two shows definitely were not created by GenX.  We were still kids when those shows started. 
Hell, I'm in my early 50s (GenX) and the Simpson's weekly show started before I even graduated high school.

Sorry for being sensitive, but we get lumped with Boomers all the time.  They're our parents, and no kid likes that!",1647733703.0,12

Married with children was basically one of the first American shows that focused on the ""awful wedding"" trope.  Previously married people were mostly depicted as functional and mostly happy.

Al Bundy the football star marries the hottest girl in the school. He becomes a loser, balding shoe salesmen. His wife becomes a TV junkie who nags him constantly. To make this worse, he is nagged all day at work by women who can never seen to be pleased.

So he just wants to get home and have a beer and watch football. His wife did not want to work or do household chores. She just wants to shop. Clearly pushing the stereotype of a ""trophy wife"" that is just physical looks and selfish. Al did not enjoy his life with her. In fact, Al had a general poor opinion of women.

Their son is sex crazed like most males are depicted.  The daughter was depicted as the dumb blonde who slept with any guy that courted her. She was shown as the daughter no father would want.

The entire show was about a dysfunctional family and Al was never shown as really sex starved, more that he didn't want it from his wife but also didn't want to cheat.

The thing is you are confusing the situation. This was depicting a sexless marriage because the neither side was happy.  Al Bundy was rejecting Peggy.  Sure I get you might see it as some guy with a hot wife should be all other that, but it's more of you ignoring their relationship.

Al rejecting advances from other women was showing him as honorable. That he may get no respect from anyone, but he certainly was not going cheat on his wife no matter how crappy of a person she was and even if she cheated on him. If Al cheated then he have been seen as a horrible person but by not cheating you could feel empathy for him when everyone berates him. If he cheated, then he would have been just as bad as his wife instead of the guy trying to be a good person to the best of his ability. Putting up with a crappy wife and trying his best to provide for his family when if they created him badly.


So nobody noticed what you are talking about because they watched movies like revenge of the nerds which was about sex starved nerds. It came out in 1984.

They are currently collecting signatures for repealing it.

To put into perspective their greed... If the kid who inherits the house doesn't want to live in it, the taxable base resets to market value at the time of inheritance. For many of those this means resetting from $100-300 thousand range to $1-3 million range; i.e. about 10x increase in property tax. This actually isn't nearly as bad as it sounds for investment/income property:

* Properties in CA appreciate in value about 5% annually. Property tax is about 1% of taxable base. Taxable base can not increase more than 2% annually until property changes hands. So it only gets better and better over time as far as heir's net worth goes.
* Annual property tax is a small fraction of annual rent the property can generate, even with taxable base at current market value of the property. And it only gets better for the landowner as years go by. Because property tax can not increase by more than 2%, but rents are increasing by far more.
* Landowners get to write off taxes as business expense.
* Landowners get to claim ""depreciation"" on rental properties (seriously? ""depreciation""? on something that *increases* in value 5% annually!?).

So.. Nope... The state isn't taxing out of those properties those ""poor"" heirs who just got ownership of investment/income properties basically for free. Those ""poor"" heirs in reality just inherited a huge wealth that keeps increasing in value and generates income that *far exceeds* property taxes, even if they are reset to market value at time of inheritance.

Meanwhile, the rest of us ends up being priced out of the market. No small wonder home ownership has been steadily declining in California.

Frankly, any kind of investment, income, or otherwise commercial property should be excluded from Prop 13. Ideally, the entire Prop 13 should be repealed and at the same time taxable base divorced from current market value of property.

Oh, and prevent landowners from claiming ""depreciation"" on things that *gain* in value year after year.",1647720801.0,15

Oklahoma surprisingly has a very large set of different geographic regions. You can go west and find sand dunes. You can go east and find wooded trees. You can got to OKC or tulsa and get large cities. You can stay central and get plains. That’s just a few. You are about 2 hours away from whatever environment you prefer.,1647714938.0,10

For someone in your shoes I would recommend you go closer to Tulsa. Lots to do and Tulsa knows how to cook. Lots of Foodies in that area. 

If you go way more rural it will be harder to find some of those things. But the weird thing is some of the best beef I have ever had in my life was in those rural areas.

She said it died down after it went off the air then streaming started getting big and when Netflix picked it up shit started going on again, though not as bad as when it was airing.

I guess as streaming became more and more the norm shit must have got really bad again because honestly, I didn't pick up that she hated it so bad a fence was necessary. She was cool to me at least.

At this point Russia has already lost in Ukraine, the 20:1000 rule decided that the moment Ukraine didn’t roll over.

There is no conceivable reality in which Russia can occupy Ukraine without significant outside help… somewhere to the tune of 500,000-1,000,000 addition troops on the ground.

Putin however also refuses to admit he’s lost and leave. So at this point his situation will become more and more desperate until he does something dumber than invading Ukraine in the first place.

For those of you unaware of the 20:1000 rule it states that an occupying force requires 20 soldiers for every 1000 civilians, assuming “light” resistance for an occupation to succeed.

Failure to hit 20 is almost never successful.

Russias current number in Ukraine… 4:1000… 4… it’s not even close, and Ukraine isn’t putting up “light” resistance.  The only chance of success Russia ever had was a literal Afghanistan type situation in which they had overwhelming support for occupation.

Wars, destructions, and manipulative politicians bring extremist ideologies. Communism rose in defeated Russia among the oppressed workers and peasants living in abject poverty. Nazism thrived in humiliated and economically depressed Germany. Taliban gained their ground among the ruins in these 9 years of guerilla war in Afghanistan, and I fear Ukraine will join the list. 

In the most likely scenario, Ukraine will be bombed to rubbles and become a playground of guerrilla forces with NATO support. At that stage they have nothing left, neither homes, economy, thirst for freedom and justice, or in general, hope for the future. What's left will be the seething hatred toward Russians and those who help them, government and citizens alike. The thirst for vengeance will create all nasty extremist ideologies, echoing with white supremacists and neo-fascists which is already growing in the entire Western world. 

I fear a few years from now, if the war in Ukraine goes on with the worst case scenario, people from the world joining Ukrianian resistance will not be idealists going for a crusade of liberty, but every form of extremists that want their hatred unleashed in the battlefield.

Its a fact, he could keep fighting this war for years and it would only eat up his economy and his own people would be living like peasants in a couple of years. 

Even if he would take Kiev Ukrainians wouldn’t budge. They would be fighting a full on guerilla war for years.

He could reach his 80s once it’s over. Nothing would be accomplished. Diplomacy fucked, Economy fucked, Russia population fucked. It’s allready becoming a complete mess.

The only thing he would do is exhaust his military. Also he would have to have a constant military force stationed in Ukraine and they would be hit with constant guerilla warfare and demonstrations and other harassments.

Basically he needs to “win” now. But how? he already has massive casualties, morale is low, troops are underfed and underequipped logistics are garbage. 

Putin attacking a NATO country with these troops would result in mass desertations and would mean a completely different warfare with massive air combat about air superiority. It would be a mass suicide for the Russian population. Lets not forget that Ukraine are fighting his whole army with barely any air support.

It’s a suicide mission that would destroy Russia completely.

If he gets into a direct conflict with NATO not a single country in EU wouldn’t join in as well. 

He would have to mass deploy his whole population.

The lack of any major air power on either side is still quite puzzling.

On the Russians side it seems that Ukraine knows where their planes and helicopters are going to be, and can easily shoot them out of the sky with Stingers, so every time they commit any air power it gets immediately shot down. You can see why they are mainly fighting a ground war in that case.

But Ukraine also is not really fielding fighter jets or bombers of its own. I guess with no Russian planes to shoot down, what a jet can do is fairly limited.

Artillery (rare guided munitions aside) generally isn't precise enough to consistently land in trenches so being below ground level is still preferable. Again, snaking trenches limit damage if they do manage to hit it directly.

The longer things drag on, the more likely Putin is to have an unhappy accident- but until he does and if he doesn't (for all the chestbeating that goes on here, there's a pretty good chance he walks away from this scotfree,) Russia is in a much better position to replenish personnel losses and can continue to just level Ukraine from afar.

Even if one of his cronies replaces him if they understand Russia can be as corrupt, ass backwards and insular as they want but that stops at their borders and their military stays where it is then things can go back to status quo except every nation in the EU will be accelerating moving away from natural gas and oil to decrease Russian oil imports and they're long-term fucked anyways.

I won't be surprised if within two-five years most EU nations go to steam cogeneration and steam pipes and heat pumps and ban installation of gas heaters and gas water heaters in new construction in the next ten years. Incentivize heat pumps and tankless electric water heaters when units go out. Not only green new deal type things but also the acceleration of independence from Russian oil.

Unfortunately for Russian citizens, they have a shit outcome from this regardless of if today the Russian military withdraws and Putin's own people announce his tragic fall out a 10 story window where he landed on his own gun that shot him in the back of the head.

The move away from oil and gas was already going to hit their primary export hard in the next ten to twenty years. Now it's now until the next ten years. Their population was in decline, economy stagnant and now the ruble is tanked and their primary export - crude and natural gas - is a massive issue for countries that have used it and they no longer want it.",1647798381.0,1

>edited for clarity.

Don't get me wrong. I utterly despite Putin. But word has it, he used to be kind of eloquent and charismatic in the beginning. He buttered everyone up to gain their trust and then he practically sowed the seeds discord in the EU and helped assholes around the world getting into positions of power. No one really noticed and those who did were trolled. Everyone was at each others throat - playing the blame Game while he and his allied-assholes were enjoying the show.

If their next successor is again something like that, everyone needs to be on their toes and be aware that it all could repeat itself.

The elite like they exist in Russia have no use for a democratic leader who respects human rights and might call laws into existence that don't fill their pockets hard and fast.

This was operation vRYAN. Russian nuclear strategy was whoever launches all their missiles first wins, so if they thought the US was going to launch, they wanted to get all their missiles in the air first (US strategy at the time was ""we can use limited nuclear strikes if the Soviets use chemical or biological weapons"" but the Soviets didn't believe in limited nuclear strikes, so you can see how bad that would have turned out). I don't know anything about modern US military planning, that stuff is still classified obviously and I'm just a civvie, but so far the Russians seem to be playing by that old playbook

The Soviets also used training exercises (as they did with Ukraine) as an excuse to prepare for invasions, they were preparing to invade Poland in 81 because of the solidarity labor movement and were almost certain (to the point of having bombers taxing on one raise preparing to launch) during the 1983 NATO Abel Archer war games because they thought we would act like them. Andropov also spent the last years of his life in and out of hospitals, supposedly like how Putin has been lately.

And don't feel bad about forgetting Chernenko, everyone did. He was already one foot in the grave when Andropov died. All he did was cough on everything before dying a year into his leadership, supposedly he even passed out during his first address.",1647778967.0,31

Those are not the people we should be remembering.

Let us instead remember heroes like Georg Elser who tried to take out the entire higher Nazi management with a bomb in 1939 but failed because Hitlers speech was shorter than usual and didn't hit him. In attendance:  Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Rudolf Hess, Robert Ley, Alfred Rosenberg, Julius Streicher, August Frank, Hermann Esser and Heinrich Himmler

This man was a true hero. He absolutely saw what was coming. He did not wait for the war to turn against the Germans and then try, he wanted to save the world from what was coming.

He was a normal worker, no personal gain beyond Hitler dying, just a man who saw what needed to be done.

Not to mention quite a few of his actual strategic decisions were total crapshoots, continually stretching themselves thinner and thinner, weakening their grip until they were ultimately defeated.

But in reality he's always been an egotistical bully with more pride than brains and this is just the first time he's been properly called on it. It makes me think of the idiot at a Blackjack table who wins a few hands and boasts about his ""system"" and then loses everything he made because it wasn't really a system at all, he was just getting lucky.

Putin kept taking and pushing and testing limits and some people see that and go ""Ooo man what a mastermind, he knew *exactly* how far he could push!"" but I think we're giving him too much credit. A super power bungling an invasion this catastrophically can't just be the senility of one old dictator, this is the fault of hundreds that have risen to power under Putin over decades, this is a structure he sculpted around his own rise. And it's dogshit. Putin wasn't a mastermind who has suffered some mental deterioration, he's just exposed for the brainless thug he's always been. Why would a mastermind build such an incompetent government around himself? Why would he have men who are better at licking his ass than doing their jobs?

Because he's not a Bond villain, he never was a Bond villain, he's a Russian thug that just kept taking because no one stood up to him, and we applauded his schoolyard bullying as some incredible 4D chess.

The attackers, led by Movsar Barayev, claimed allegiance to the Islamist separatist movement in Chechnya. They demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya and an end to the Second Chechen War.

It's all done for the same reason why GOP pushes wedge non-issue issues like abortion, gay rights, birth certificate of the black president, welfare (but if they are black) and threat of communism. It's all to stay in power.

Putin's popularity started to wane, partially due to to 2008 crisis that has destroyed the legend that he alone guarantees Russia's stability, so when he has said in 2011 that he will be  the president again after 4 years of being a prime minister, there were protests. He thought he was betrayed and a patriotic turn happened - oppressive laws were implemented, 20 people got prison time from Bolotnaya protests. etc.

Also economy began to stagnate because the impulse of the economic reforms from the beginning of 2000s has finished working, everything that could have developed, did. Putin didn't implement independent courts, rule of law, and more than that he turned to government controlled corporations in 2007.

So the only thing he could sell now is a territorial gain and a military victory, since the prosperity has stopped being enough and there was no new one. Western countries sell security threats the same way on a lesser scale all the time - ""think of terrorists, give us more power"", ""think of the child porn, kill all encryption"".

So Putin took Crimea, is was a wild success, it's the only legitimate territory outside of Russia Russians consider to be ""theirs"", they were ready to suffer economically for the win. Donbass was popular too but after a couple of years people began to get tired of spending money on foreign affairs when the country is still suffering. And when in 2018 before election Putin has not suggested anything new, a new wave of disillusion began, new wave of protest, protest voting, several opposition governors were elected, a circus has happened. Same in 2019, but Moscow took more control. Even more in 2020.

Then a de-facto coup has happened - Putin has changed a constitution, gave himself 12 more years of presidency, increased his power, and prepared several places he can retire into - National Council which can have unspecified presidential powers, and a place in Senate for all ex-presidents.

The current war seems to be a repeat of Crimea and Donbass - it's a polarizing thing that can increase popularity short term, and be a pretext for further militarization of internal politics (Search for Greg Yudin articles on that), meaning instead of disdain for opposition, they can be considered more of the enemy, while masses will rally around the flag. Only the operation didn't go how they expected - they way it did in Crimea, or in Donbass initially, Ukrainians didn't greet the Russian army, it didn't all end in 5 days. Also West isn't fractured and didn't add some weak sanctions like the first 2 times.

Putin also has delusions of redoing the end of Cold War results, but it's all secondary to elites trying to stay in power and continue to secure their stolen wealth.",1647785420.0,7

I agree with this point, because I feel like the West have their own leaders to blame, for simply not standing up to him when they had all the previous chances. The 'major' sanctions that have been recently imposed, should have been used at latest, for the annexation of Crimea. Every time he's pushed a little harder, and the West responded with nothing but hot air and frowns, he knows he's gotten away with it, and can get away with more next time.

Agreed. If world leaders had shown him a whole lot more consequences for Crimea, Syria, Georgia or Chechnya, things might not have gotten to this point.

> Ukrainian officials have said Russian forces bombed a school where 400 people were taking shelter yesterday.

> The attack comes after the mayor of Mariupol said Russian forces forcefully deported several thousand people from the besieged city last week.

> In its latest update on the conflict the MoD said: &quot;Over the past week Russian forces have made limited progress in capturing these cities; instead, Russia has increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties.&quot;It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.

9388,worldnews,Russian forces bomb school where 400 people were taking shelter in Mariupol,,1647761955.0,1652,27625,0.94,agnostic_science,"I think a couple things going on. First, I think intentional terror attacks is indeed a goal of Russia. Putin can use the humanity of Zelensky and the Western world against itself. Putin doesn't care about human life. But we might. So he's leveraging that fact like a true sociopath.

But also, I'm pretty sure Putin's realizes he can no longer hope to hold Ukraine long-term, so that his current target now is the destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure. I don't think it's about lives, land, soviet empire reconstruction, nato, or nazis. I'm convinced it's about the oil in the black sea and the natural gas reserves on the east and west of Ukraine. Ukraine would be ranked something like 7th in the world for natural gas reserves. Russia doesn't want the competition on the European energy market. E.g. everyone knows, given a choice, who Germany would rather buy from, even at a markup. 

So my guess, is if Russia cripples Ukrainian infrastructure to the point where Ukraine can't realistically tap into those reserves for another generation or two, they'll suddenly find a way to call it mission accomplished. If Ukraine has to spend the next 20 years building back homes and schools, that's just all the less effort they can spend building the industrial capacity to tap their energy reserves. I think Russia would have *preferred* to seize those reserves for themselves but I think they'll accept 'merely' crippling Ukraine as option 2. Well, as long as one last condition is met: Russia also needs to figure out a way to supply water to Crimea so that region doesn't turn into a wasteland. But if need be, they might have to just accept busing in water via convoy for the foreseeable future. That's not cost-effective, but maybe Putin won't care because that will be some future leader's problem.",1647781047.0,2

A big part of preparing soldiers for war is through systematic dehumanization and reprogramming. Soldiers are trained to abandon their human empathy for others, and to only see targets as targets. There is specific training for overriding the instinctive psychology most of us have, where we are repelled by extreme violence against others.

I don't remember if it was after WWI or WWII, but at some point, governments became aware that most of their soldiers missed on purpose during the war. Not due to bad aim, but because they didn't want to kill random strangers. And the governments of the world have been working hard to ""rectify"" that since.

Technology absolutely helps, though. It was significantly harder to kill a stranger in warfare with a sword, once upon a time, slightly easier with a gun, but doing it from a warplane? Or a mortar? Or with a drone? Where you literally don't see humans, just tiny specs on a screen?

If every firing hole, every window every building could have a combatant in it taking a city is a very scary prospect.

Still can’t defend it, still won’t defend it but it’s happening. I’ve seen pictures of Ukrainian armed forces inside things like gymnasiums so the fact a school is targeted isn’t out of the question. Otherwise these buildings could become safe havens for entrenched troops who hide amongst civilians sheltering. It’s why guerrilla warfare is so hard to combat whilst maintaining any sense of humanity. Something which if the media is to be believed the current Russians have little respect for.

It’s abhorrent that innocents are dragged into this but more should have been done to get the civilians out before the encirclement. It’s clear Russia has little respect for humanitarian corridors and it was naive to think they would.

Just saw a post about how some streamer makes 900k a week promoting gambling to kids, and the comments were all like for 900k I would give everybody a gambling addiction. Every single comment was that, nobody stopped to think.

Nobody was thinking about the 1 in 5 gambling addicts that attempt suicide, or the homelessness from gambling, the families that lives would be ruined. It also wasn't even a choice between poverty or 900k a week it was a choice between like 200k a month or 900k a week as this person is a streamer and can make tons of money in legitimate ways.

I also have a friend who I have known since elementary school who is working with a group of people that are making some NFT project, and I believe this project is a complete scam. Got into a huge argument with him and he says he is only helping program for them and it's not that bad. He also coincidentally is getting paid obscene amounts of money to do it.

I find most people would be fine doing completely horrible and awful things if it meant they can make some money.

Sanctions don't work.  Didn't work on North Korea, didn't work on Russia the first several times, didn't work on Iran, didn't work on China.

Putin may be a dick, but he isn't crazy.  Don't be surprised when Finland or any of the non-NATO European nations are next.  Or Taiwan.  The west is giving China the green light to go ahead and finish taking Taiwan by force.

The best we can hope for with the current course of action is Russia getting bogged down in a costly quagmire like Afghanistan, which is arguably what killed the Soviet Union.  Maybe there will be an uprising in Russia to depose Putin.  I doubt it, though, since a majority of Russians support Putin's actions.

I hope I'm wrong, but I honestly think this is just the beginning of what will lead to USSR 2.0, and an expanded China.  At some point there will be a nuclear Iran as well, which will completely change the balance of power in the middle east.  Because you're right: no one wants to risk escalation to a nuclear war.

Maybe something good will come from all this.  Maybe the world will sprint to energy independence.  Maybe we'll largely do away with fossil fuels.  Maybe globalization will die, ending the exploitation of workers around the globe.  Maybe people will innovate and increase food production capabilities.  The optimist in me really wants there to be a silver lining to all this.

Humans have the ability to be good, and the ability to be bad. We will be either depending on the situation, our upbringing, or our environment. And even the terms good and bad, are not really correct too. Things we deem bad now, we didn’t think was bad before. Some people in the world are vegan, and they believe it’s wrong to harm animals for food. But imagine trying to explain veganism to a person from 5,000 years ago, they would be absolutely bewildered that someone would refuse to eat available food. And when explained it’s for moral reasons, they would be even more confused as they believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with eating meat you hunted. It’s a similar situation with good and bad, what you think is good, probably won’t be considered good forever, and what we think is tolerable, is probably going to be considered insane in the future. 

I went off on a bit of a tangent there but my main point is that human morality is not subjective, and a lot of us would do things we would never dream of doing if we were desperate enough, or we were taught it was right to do by other people. Rape is about the closest you can get to objectively bad, morally wise, and I can’t think of a society that ever thought raping was a morally good thing.

Right now not a single country is able to select a leader that won't be power-hungry and corrupt, by design. Sometimes rare anomalies like Sankara happen, but you can see at his example how fast they are being dealth with. If a good person will want to become a ruler - he won't even be able to compete with those who ruthlessly ruled various buisnesses and saved enough money to run those elections, or with those who have powerful and rich friends to fund them (and those friends will later ask for benefits, of course). Becoming a ruler for selfless person is impossible in our world, and current rulers will never want to change the system that benefits them, the upper class, and not to anyone else. So that problem is up for people to solve. 

Another huge problem is capitalism. When people make limitless earning and accumulation of wealth as goals of life, and build entire society around it - it leads to soceity being dominated by egoistic sociopaths, who put profits above anything else (look at any megacorp to see the example).

I agree this is a complicated issue, with serious economic ramifications beyond residential heating. What worries me is that the discourse around Russian gas treats it as an uncrossable red line, something that is completely unthinkable and unacceptable in Europe.  
  
A lot of unthinkable things have happened in the last weeks, and we're not doing ourselves any favors by thinking in terms of taboos. Putin is weak *now*; isn't this the best time to strike a massive blow against him and destroy his dictatorship for good? I honestly don't know. Maybe Gazprom money will keep him afloat long enough to rebuild and come back even stronger next time (and he *will* come); maybe the failure in Ukraine will be too much and his regime will collapse on its own.  
  
I would like to see a serious re-evaluation of the Russian Gas Problem, considering all the costs quantitatively and weighing them against the huge weight of Russia's threat (which is admittedly hard to quantify).

9831,worldnews,Ukrainian Railways Chief Says 'Honest' Belarusians Are Cutting Russian Supplies By Train,,1647786816.0,62,2803,0.99,OsbertParsely,"That figure is usually quoted between 800,000 and 1.2 million. It includes the Russian Air Force, Naval Forces + Marines, Combat land forces and logistical support units, as well as reservists for all three branches.

Also, in modern warfare - much, much more so than ancient the warfare - combat units are literally the “tip of the logistical spear.” It easily takes 10x or more people behind the lines to logistically support a single fighting soldier on the front with food, fuel, and ammunition. A single modern 5th generation fighter plane with a single “combat soldier” piloting can take 100x-1000x rear echelon troops to logistically support - even when you exclude the civilians required for manufacturing the damn things (and their spare parts) in the first place. 

One of Russias current woes is logistics - they simply don’t have enough non-combat troop and non-combat trucks to logistically support material with high logistic requirements (like MLRS batteries) while in theatre. Which is why you see so many pieces of armored equipment being simply abandoned in Ukraine.

In other words, even with “only” 200k combat troops out of 1 million total, Russia’s army is simply TOO biased towards combat troops and lacks the logistical troops required to be able to effectively conduct modern war fighting. 

Contrast the wonder of modern logistics that is the US military, which conducted two concurrent wars in the Middle East for over 10 years without running into logistical issues like we see in Ukraine.

But the reality is Russia has conscription which is a period of mandatory service for defense purposes only. Russia and other countries count them despite having far smaller professional army that is always trained beyond one year. 

Most of UK, Canada, and the USA are full time volunteer only militaries. So their numbers include full ready to go soldiers. And the reserves of those countries tend to stem from a continuously trained group over time that they are in(reservists vary from mandatory reserve time after leaving the military to people who joined up and do monthly service for a few years without joining the active military).

In theory they could be called up, however this would take a lot of time and based on what we've seen so far it's very unclear if Russia has:

1. The ability to quickly retrain them since military skills like all skills atrophy if unused
2. If it's even worthwhile to try as the conscripts so far have apparently done very poorly
3. The gear to equip these hypothetical millions of reservists as proper maintenance seems to not to have been carried out and some things sold off
4. The ability to transport and supply the reservists at the front for more than a few days, just throwing bodies at a problem solves nothing if they can't get there and once there they run out of ammo and starve.

* they need an active military contingent in Kuril Islands (Japan would take these back if they could).
* they need an active military contingent on their eastern border with China - they are not allies. 
* they need to maintain a sizeable military force in Kaliningrad.
* they need to be able to supply troops to Belarus and Kazakhstan. Both would **already** be toppled if not for Russian military intervention. 
* they also operate in foreign regions like Venesuela or Syria.
* and you also need troops **within** the country. 

Most countries in the world are not capable of maintaining these many zones of influence at once. 

People also seem to have forgotten that GDP wise Russia is the size of... Italy. Despite twice as large population and being rich with oil and gas. This DOES affect how much they can truly spend on military, especially when you also consider mass scale corruption - out of every 10 rubles spent on military 5 probably went to oligarchs pockets.

It's true that compared to WW2 these numbers seem tiny - after all Germany invaded Poland with like 1.5 million troops (and Poland had over 400k at a time).

But times have changed. Infantry alone no longer matters. You need to also supply planes, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, ballistic missiles, helicopters and so on. So it's less about quantity and more about quality.",1647799098.0,1

Typical Russian propaganda. Out of 4 opposition parties currently sitting in the Parliament in Ukraine, only 1 was banned.

The other 3 opposition parties are pro-Ukrainian and outnumber the one that was banned. 

Pro-Russian parties are not a significant political force in Ukraine. In fact, they have struggled for relevancy since 2014 Maidan Revolution and war in Donbass, when support for them sharply declined. They don't have a strong leader with widespread support, which caused constant merges, splits and struggle for power. The party that was banned, existed less than 4 years.

They have zero relevancy in presidential elections, and the only reason they even have seats in the Parliament is due to widespread support by major oligarchs like Akhmetov and some good old-fashioned voter fraud, that is sadly still exists in certain eastern regions in Ukraine.",1647798247.0,1

It originated in November 2013 as a right-wing, paramilitary confederation of several radical nationalist organizations at the Euromaidan revolt in Kyiv, where its street fighters participated in clashes with riot police. The coalition became a political party on 22 March 2014, at which time it claimed to have roughly 10,000 members. Founding groups included Trident (Tryzub), led by Dmytro Yarosh and Andriy Tarasenko, and the Ukrainian National Assembly–Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNA–UNSO), a political and paramilitary organization.

But the guy is also fascinating (and pompous in a very compelling way). His ""I am become death destroyer of worlds"" quote hints at his grandeur and way of speaking (and his classmates petitioning for him to shut up.)

Btw, the destroyer of worlds quote is a neat trick played by Oppenheimer as it has a dual meanings. Oppenheimer had studied the Baghavad gita and I assume he knew of the second interpretation which he kept as a bit of an inside/private insight.

Also, Oppenheimer was surrounded by equally compelling, eccentric physicists who both understood the power of atomic weapons and their horrors. Given the large cast, I assume it will delve into their lives and philosophies as well.

I am excited for the film but I am also fascinated by Oppenheimer.

Btw, there was a TV show called Manhattan that hinted at the tension and intrigue of just Manhattan Project. It showed the potential of the setting and cast even if it didn't fully realize that potential. Hopefully, Nolan's film will be better.",1647797870.0,2

Lots of great Latin influence on the brass playing, crazy syncopated lines, lots of dissonance, and written by a man who is used to working with the best musicians America has to offer. There is 20th century technique called serialism or 12 tone writing. Basically you create an order of notes but you have to use every note (all 12 tones) first before you go back and repeat the pattern. These notes can be any length or register and audiences usually HATE this music. It is super hard to play and sounds like ass. The song ""Cool"" from West Side, has a 12 tone sequence in it that is actually melodic and interesting.

I guess i'm trying to say is that this is one of the hardest musicals to perform, takes its inspiration from Romeo and Juliet (meaning the acting has to be A+ for people to buy hearing this story again), and already has an Academy Award winning version of it in existence. No shit he doesn't want to do a musical he just did THE musical and everyone kinda went.... ""meh.""",1647790335.0,3

Maybe instead of 50s greaser gangs, have it be about two star-crossed lovers who are affiliated with the Bloods and Crips, Latin Kings and Gangster Disciples, or maybe rival drug cartels in Mexico. 

  
I had zero interest in this film, and you'd think I would considering I'm Latino and I enjoy films Latin American/Spanish-language films. It was probably a fresh story for its time, and I still want to see the original at some point, but the concept in 2022 comes across as very quaint and outdated. Is the message really relevant to at-risk youth who post and watch videos of gang-related rappers getting shot in the head on Instagram Live (rapper and Blood gang member Indian Red Boy) for entertainment, and who follow YouTube personalities like Crip Mac, who has ""Hoover Killa"" tattooed across his forehead to show that he's murdered at least one rival gang member from Hoover Criminals? 

  
Teenagers who need to hear the movie's so-called ""message"" are just going to laugh at it. I doubt the musical's message even had any real impact when it came out. Were at-risk teens really going to Broadway shows in the 1950s? Did the 1961 have a positive impact? Because the second largest Latino street gang in the world, 18th Street, was formed sometimes in West Los Angles in the 1960s, and has expanded throughout L.A. county and into Central America. The Crips were founded in 1969. Chicago's Gangster Disciples were founded in 1969.

This music was written by Leonard Bernstein who was the conductor for the New York Phil for a good while starting in the 50's (I think?).  Imagine someone who was so well acquainted with music that he is selected to run the lead symphony for America during America's peak.  He knew all of the major works that would be performed and was familiar with all of the newer 20th century stuff that really pushed music theory into a new territory.  Then he wanted to create a musical that used some of these techniques, while still sounding great.  THIS MUSIC IS FUCKING HARD.  Lots of great Latin influence on the brass playing, crazy syncopated lines, lots of dissonance, and written by a man who is used to working with the best musicians America has to offer.  There is 20th century technique called serialism or 12 tone writing.  Basically you create an order of notes but you have to use every note (all 12 tones) first before you go back and repeat the pattern. These notes can be any length or register and audiences usually HATE this music.  It is super hard to play and sounds like ass.  The song ""Cool"" from West Side, has a 12 tone sequence in it that is actually melodic and interesting.  

I guess i'm trying to say is that this is one of the hardest musicals to perform, takes its inspiration from Romeo and Juliet (meaning the acting has to be A+ for people to buy hearing this story again), and already has an Academy Award winning version of it in existence.  No shit he doesn't want to do a musical he just did THE musical and everyone kinda went.... ""meh.""",1647762513.0,193

Now the Congo book that /u/PopPopPoppy referenced was absolutely ignorant crap based on stereotypes Herge had picked up from contemporary news and so on. But then he met and became lifelong friends with sculptor [Zhang Chongren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Chongren), who was an overseas student studying in Belgium at the time. This friendship inspired Herge to do more research into the places he was depicting, and take responsibility for what his comics showed to people.

As a result of this influence, Herge went on to disown his earlier, stereotype-based ignorant stories and indeed in most countries stories like the Russia and Congo episodes have not been widely sold in decades. His later stories would involve a great deal of careful research and an attempt to be fair to those depicted, rather than just based on 'common knowledge' stereotypes.

The character you linked is directly based on his good friend Zhang, with an almost identical name (in terms of contemporary French romanization). The two of them worked on the character together, and Zhang also informed Herge about what was happening in China at the moment, thus the Mukden incident (and its reality of being a fake excuse by the Japanese to invade) and the colonial Japanese being depicted (this depiction of the Japanese is still fairly racist, but here we must also take into account that his information was coming from a Chinese person whose country was currently being colonized by them, so not the most fair and neutral of sources).

Zhang would return to China and suffer through WW2, the Chinese Civil War, the Cultural Revolution, and so on for four decades before being reunited with Herge. During this time, motivated by missing his friend and concern for his wellbeing, Herge included Zhang's character Chang in *Tintin in Tibet,* where he had Tintin called from far away to Chang's aid when he was in trouble.

After China opened up once more, Zhang moved to France for the rest of his life, and the two reunited in real life at last.",1647741631.0,62

The movie is an upgrade over the Wise version in most aspects. Pretty much the only part thats worse by comparison is the recontextualization of Somewhere.

Tony and Maria's reconciliation does work narratively without that song. The cute moment with Rita Moreno wasn't worth that trade off.

Riff and Bernardo were both strict upgrades from their originals.  Maria and Anita were at worst side-grades.  Tony is more debatable, but I'd argue that Beymer wasn't really any better overall than Elgort.

>I have a rainbow in my heart venerable lady . I weep because Tintin is going but the sun shines because I have a new mother and father

The thing about Herge's racism is that yeah, it definitely exists but only in the earliest of his books, a lot of which are hard to find in English ( Congo especially) and they were written in the 30's. Easier to get in French but I've never seen an English copy of Congo

Herge never stopped dealing with foreigners, they're all over TinTin but the man clearly changed his views on other races and it is clearly reflected in his later work. The 7 Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun are my personal favourites and they are really respectful to MesoAmerican culture.

Not a fan of the movie but TinTin is not some massively racist publication. It's origins are racist but the later stories are not and I can't speak for anyone but TinTin sparked my entire interest in other cultures when I was a nipper",1647768915.0,5

I mean holy shit, Temple starts with a banger version of “Anything Goes” in Mandarin (ok, bad mandarin) at Club Obi Wan in Shanghai, that devolves into double cross deal with a gangster and a gunfight, that turns into a cargo airplane escape from China, that was crashing but the heroes jumped out of the plane on an inflatable life raft, upon which they toboggan down Mt Everest(?!), then through the mountain slopes and rivers of the Himalayas until landing in some river in northeast India! 

Also, as a little girl at the time, my other two highlights were Willie’s gold and red sequined dress from the nightclub and the sparkling jeweled white one she was gifted at Pankot palace.

Pardon any inaccuracies, that was all from memory—it made a big impression. After all that razzle dazzle Raiders felt gritty and dull, which I didn’t appreciate until I was older.",1647789571.0,3

When the character can't express what the feel in conversation they sing. When that doesn't go far enough they dance.

This is in part because a song is interesting - a monologue is not.

I think OP is saying that the rest of the acting and writing was good enough that these thoughts were already conveyed (like Romeo and Julie already does) - meaning the songs disconnect you from the story and become ""Fat Lipped Alliagator"" moments of weirdness before toy get back to the story.

Spielberg was the executive producer of Back to the Future, which was produced by Amblin, and it's believed it was his idea to use a car for a time machine. [The original script had a refrigerator as the time machine](https://screenrant.com/back-future-time-machine-original-plan-fridge-delorean/), but Spielberg believed it needed to have movement and was also worried kids would trap themselves in fridges.

So clearly Amblin wasn't off-limits. Then what was the rule? Indiana Jones was in the movie as a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" poster clearly visible in Halliday's childhood room. There's not a whole lot more that would fit. Jaws or E.T.?

And iirc they didn't reject him for conflicting visions. So I see him being pretty open to Eon's input. Still, that's a very valid point and could come in the way.

But yeah, as someone whose favorite franchise is Bond and thinks of Spielberg as one of the best directors ever, Top 5 even... Yeah. Steven Spielberg's 007 is one of my greatest fantasies.

Personally speaking - and as much as I love Lewis Gilbert, and that is still my favorite Bond film either way - I always wondered what Spielberg's The Spy Who Loved Me would've looked like. It is a movie that fits his style like a glove. Considering that _that_ was the moment he was rejected, as he says he went after Cubby Broccoli right after Jaws (and therefore in-between TMWTGG and TSWLM), if he were accepted, he would've gotten precisely that one. One of cinema's greatest What If? moments imo.",1647753841.0,15

I would argue that Ansel was one of the highlights, though.  Whom he was playing opposite of, was the biggest problem.  Her lack of any actual acting experience really showed, and both her interpretation of Maria and the writing combined for a very flat character.  Maria is supposed to be a vibrant, excited, rebellious, just-come-of-age young woman who pushes boundaries, while the Maria we got was this coy, innocent, shy, timid girl, who I didn’t and couldn’t believe once that she would go against her brother and family’s wishes.  There’s also such a lack of chemistry between her and Ansel, I question whether they even screen tested together.

It felt like they used the book of horror movie clichés as reference material when writing the script and the movie is glorious for that. 

* Protagonist gets stuck in small backwater town? Check.
* Spookiness that everyone except for the protagonist is at least vaguely aware of? Check.
* Team of kids are the only ones who really know what's going on? Of course.
* Kids proceed to make incredibly stupid decisions anyway? Hey, you know that room where a bunch of people committed ritualistic suicide to transfer their souls into the animatronics we're literally here to destroy? Let's bang in there! 
* Spooky things toying with the characters before going for the kill? Absolutely!
* Cliché dialogue? It's so cheesy you could supply a sandwich shop for a few months with it.
* Over-the-top action / fight scenes? They're the best! Each animatronic dies in a unique way but the crowning achievement was the one who got curb-stomped into a urinal.

Adenomyosis occurs when the endometrium grows and sheds inside the uterine muscles, forcing the muscle tissue to separate. Compared to endo, the resulting pain is more like repeated sharp stabs. I delivered my son without anesthesia just so I could compare the pain of adenomyosis and labour. Within 20 mins, I dilated from 7 to 10 inches, and that's when I thought the pain was matched. Different but matched.

Adenomyosis can cause heavier periods. For the first three days of my period, as soon as I inserted a menstrual cup, it was already full... I was basically pissing ""blood"" and so iron deficient that I wasn't functioning (despite daily iron supplements with vitamin C).

I've lost count of the number of doctors I've seen about my symptoms. I ran out of local doctors, so I made out of town appointments. Before appointments, I would dress professionally and practice speaking succinctly and intelligently in an effort to make them take me more seriously. They didn't.

>Endometriosis (en-doe-me-tree-O-sis) is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis. Rarely, endometrial-like tissue may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located.

>With endometriosis, the endometrial-like tissue acts as endometrial tissue would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But because this tissue has no way to exit your body, it becomes trapped. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions — bands of fibrous tissue that can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.

>Endometriosis can cause pain — sometimes severe — especially during menstrual periods. Fertility problems also may develop. Fortunately, effective treatments are available.",1647764790.0,49

I took myself off that after 2 years because mood swings were never even my main issue, and they are now nonexistent unless I get occasionally a little impatient due to constant pain. 

My issue has always been debilitating mastalgia with hot, double-sized breasts for one sometimes two or more weeks of the month. More recently I started with extreme abdominal swelling and digestive issues in the week before a period.

So now here we are 20 years later, I’ve had my hormones tested by my family doctor but they were normal. From the gyn, I was given an endometriosis pill called Orilissa for a passing symptom I mentioned, painful sex, without any exploratory procedure to find out if it really was endometriosis. That made me feel even more congested and it stopped my period so I took myself off it after four months. 

Bottom line is my gyn definitely thinks it’s a head case. At least now I’m old enough to have mammograms which identified I have heterogeneously dense breasts so I have those every year to make sure it’s not turning into cancer. Every year closer to menopause, I hope for eventual relief. Looking back, what a shame I missed so much.

Finally hoping to switch gynecologists this year and see what they say. I’m exhausted from explaining it with doctors to be honest.",1647788158.0,2

My periods are heavy like yours, I stand up and blood rushes down my legs just nonstop. 

I slept in my bathtub for two weeks during a month long period and every time I walked my heart pounded and I felt weak, cold, and unstable, like I couldn’t hold myself up.

I described to my doctor finally giving into >!let’s say, surgery pain meds I wasn’t supposed to have!< as “feeling human again” or feeling like I had the dignity of being a human again. I know it could’ve been far more dangerous to continue that if I hadn’t gotten actual help (thankfully I did eventually get a specialist doctor and didn’t have to use anything strong once I had actual hormonal treatment) but I wasn’t sleeping or eating anymore, I wanted just an hour to close my eyes, I can’t even comprehend that kind of desperation when I’m sitting here not in pain right now.

Every once in a while we will get a doc who is at least somewhat versed in endo and they share the frustration in that there has been very little research dedicated to endo which means there is little medical literature on treating it. We have been trying to get pregnant for a couple years now and have had to go the IVF route. Everything seemed to be tracking for implantation until her latest visit where they found a growth inside her uterus which will need to be removed and biopsied before they can do the implantation procedure. It’s discouraging to say the least.

In general there are four options:

Pain management - long term pain killer use may be enough for mild cases, but it does nothing for the debilitating aspect of this condition.

Hormone therapy - this is generally used as a first step and means either going on a specific type of pill permanently, or a type of HRT which can have pretty damaging side effects if you’re young. It works for mild to moderate cases but not consistently.

Removal via laparoscopic excision - invasive, expensive, effective in the short to medium term but requires specialist training and presents a high probability of generating more scar tissue, requiring more surgery in the future.

Total hysterectomy - has its own hormone implications and it’s obviously a savage way of dealing with it. It is not regarded as 100% effective in all cases.

Unfortunately, this info from Mayo isn't quite accurate as endo is wildly misunderstood. Endo lesions do not bleed and become ""trapped,"" a theory known as retrograde menstruation. This would be a valid theory if endometriosis and endometrium were histologically identical! Here is an excerpt from the Center for Endometriosis Care's website :

""Endometriosis is not just ‘painful periods’ - nor is it simply rogue bits of normal endometrium implanted in abnormal places, caused by backflow menstruation, as many articles, the media, endometriosis foundations, spokespersons and even some scientists continue to incorrectly describe. Endometrium – the lining of the womb which breaks down and is shed during menstruation – is histologically different from the functional glands and stroma that comprise endometriosis lesions. Contrary to popular public doctrine, while the tissue does resemble – it is not identical to – the native endometrium."" 

Additionally, extrapelvic endometriosis is much more common than previously understood and has been found on every organ in the body! The *only* current effective treatment for endo is true wide excision surgery with an endometriosis expert, although there are hormonal options for managing symptoms! These will not slow the progression of the disease, though.

While a lot of women experience severe pain with their period, many (like myself) experience very little, or experience pain that isn't tied to menstruation at all. Other women experience pain at all times regardless of where they are in their cycle. Some women have no symptoms and only discover their endo when they are trying to have children, other women have debilitating chronic pain. Some women with no pain have stage 4 (the most severe) endo, while others with severe pain have stage 1. There is also a really common misconception that you can't have endo without having a close female relative with it, which also isn't true.

In my experience, the only pain I experienced was during intercourse, and other than that maybe some heavy periods but that was always blamed on the type of birth control I was using. It took a decade of painful intercourse, difficulty with urination, and eventually developing severe bowel issues that lead me to look into endo. I only looked into it after I learned about endo from a youtuber I watched, as it was never brought up a single time by my obgyn who knew about the issues I was struggling with. I had my first excision a few months ago and discovered that not only do I have extensive endo, but it's affecting my ureters and would have likely led to renal failure had it been left untreated. It took me ten years, multiple different doctors, hundreds of hours of medical research, and finding my own specialist/surgeon to get to this point. Pain with periods, family history, and infertility are usually the go-to diagnostic criteria, but there are so many more symptoms that are interconnected and important to be aware of when it comes to finding treatment for endo.",1647784124.0,10

ED doctors are good at what they can do: saving lives in an acute emergency, and admitting patients to the right medical service. They are doing the ultrasounds to make sure there aren't any active bleeds, or ovarian torsions, etc., things that could kill your wife then and there. Endometriosis is a disease that requires extensive months long hormonal treatment at minimum, which may or may not lead to surgical intervention in the end.

Because of the way tort law works in the United States, the ED physician isn't going to prescribe the hormonal therapies that can help with endometriosis. Because, once they prescribe the medications (that require month long trials) and something happens to your wife, a medical malpractice lawyer is going to eat the ED physician for breakfast. After decades of lawsuits, physicians found out that although they can technically prescribe any medication, that staying in ""their lane"" (aka their specialty), led to minimizing lawsuits, and getting higher rate of approvals for the things and procedures they prescribe. The fact is they can, (and I can too as I'm a physician in a different field) can access databases which show which medications can help with treating endometriosis. Or any lay person can google it as well, it's not hidden or arcane knowledge. But the ED doctor never will prescribe outside of their lane, because they will receive pushback from both the legal system, licensing boards, insurance system, and hospital bureaucracy. They also can't do the surgery that would likely give definitive relief. 

I'm curious as to why they never admitted your wife to the OBGYN service in the hospital though, even if they didn't treat it in the ED. If you PM me the state you live in, I can try finding some resources for OBGYN specialists for you.",1647792630.0,59

There's also hysterectomy.

why? because when you go in with symptoms, which happen MONTHLY, you're ignored. over and over and over. you're told it's not that bad, to take ocp, to take antidepressants, everything but actually look into to WHY this is occurring. everything but trying to treat the condition. 

when a man goes to the doctor, he is believed when he says his pain is severe. when a man goes to the doctor, they run tests and try to find out why, try to find a diagnosis based on evidence in real time, like labs, x-rays, biopsies etc. when a man goes to the doctor for pain, he isn't told that the pain is normal, and prescribed antidepressants. 

you cannot study a disease if you ignore the patients with it, that present with symptoms. Endometriosis isn't studied because the patients aren't being treated, they're being brushed off. so, the disease flys under the radar. not because it's a minor (which it isn't) condition. Erectile dysfunction is a minor condition. it doesn't cause pain. it doesn't destroy reproductive function. BUT, it has been studied VERY widely and has a half a dozen Rx treatments. and, I am sure when a man presents with ED, no one tells him to just suck it up, and get back to work.

It sounds like the retrograde menstruation theory postulates that once endometrial tissue leaves the endometrium, local factors from wherever the tissue goes changes the cells to a degree, which may account for some histological differences.

The Mirena will not affect your risk of blood clot. The contraceptive that is more likely to cause a clot is the combined pill which has both oestrogen and progesterone. The Mirena/mini pill/implanon and depot only have progesterone which usually only causes risk of clots in high doses beyond what the mirena gives.

 Tubal ligation won't affect your cycle at all, it only blocks the tubes and so your pain will continue. A hysterectomy at a young age tends to avoid taking the ovaries as these have a distinct purpose of making hormones for your body's wellbeing and health. These hormones will continue to cause cyclic flare ups and endometriosis is a hormonal disease, the uterus is not really involved in causing it, only in producing some of its symptoms. If you did have a full hysterectomy, it would mean needing hormone replacement therapy until you are about 50, and even then this can trigger endometriosis.

What you probably want is either someone who can do excision surgery (though it's not always possible), or to consider GnRH injections (if these work then it's pretty much endo, though they put you into a temporary menopause).",1647772032.0,214

Went to a gastroenterologist afterwards and the first thing they said at the appointment was “have you been tested for celiac?” My symptoms were so obvious. But no, I’m probably lying about what vegetables I eat.

It probably took about a decade for a diagnosis of endometriosis. Lots of doctor’s appointments, they would just dismiss my concerns and recommend birth control or high-dose naproxen if it was bothering me so much. Finally, it was getting so painful I could barely function for about 1/3 of my life, and I literally had a (female!) gynecologist tell me “You’re just describing normal periods”. By that point I’d done enough research online (I know, I know) that I suspected I had endometriosis. Ended up requesting a different doctor (hospital insisted prior doctor was really really good and knew her stuff, just had a brusque bedside manner). And guess what? Endometriosis. And an endometrioma so large that one ovary almost needed to be removed along with it.

Having more female researchers absolutely would help, no question, but maybe not as much as you think. I know there's an element of bias that could potentially affect results, and I'm not sure how to counter balance that, but I really think that there needs to be at least one person actually suffering from a moderate to severe version of the condition on the research panel. Not all women magically understand the suffering and woes of other women, and I've run into a distressing number of them who think that *because* they're a women, despite being healthy with no serious or similar issues, it automatically makes them sometimes more knowledgeable about various conditions than the people suffering through them. I think that's part of why the medical attitude of ""oh come on it's just a regular period you're overreacting"" attitude is so prevalent, especially from the nurses who are more hands on for individual patient care. They're the ones relaying pertinent information to the overseeing doctor, and if they think a patient is overreacting or a hypochondriac, I imagine an over worked or busy doctor isn't too liable in enough situations to make an assessment that says different. 


Without the perspective of someone who has gone through these conditions to help researchers understand the impact of the research, even as just an advisory role to help give a fuller understanding of the data collected, I'm afraid of an overly removed clinical conclusion being made, but I also know that that is deeply rooted in my experiences of basically being told I'm lying for attention when I've been in so much pain I wanted to die, and had so much of my medical care neglected because either doctors didn't believe me, or just did not know enough or understand the condition well enough to give me the care I need. Even today my doctors basically know jack all about PCOS or what I can do to help it, besides fertility management which is so far from what I care about as to be offensive. If it isn't birth control, they have no clue what treatment I can try, and I'm  hundreds of miles away from any medical center that has even a basic understanding of this condition.

My doc was also supportive and matter-of-fact and, just by doing that, she gave me my life back. It's been 4 years and I can tell you that quality of life on this side has improved *tremendously*.

I had everything out except for the ovaries- left them in due to being young and my doc saying that, even with increased risk of other problems, the hormonal benefits I'd receive over the next ~15 yrs were important and help protect against heart disease and other issues. They're still little assholes-every now and then I get an instance of painful ovulation or a cyst-but those are increasingly rare. I also can no longer tell where in my cycle I am -  sore boobs etc. have all gone away, moreso now than right after the surgery. Here's hoping I made the right call...

One thing I want to let you know--you may find that recovery takes slightly longer for you than the standard 6-8 week timeframe you're seeing for women who have hysterectomies for other issues. (My doc pointed out that the inflammatory nature of endometriosis can contribute to slow healing.) I ended up waiting 12 weeks before my doc lifted all post-surgical restrictions. Not trying to scare you--it was not especially painful and might not even be an issue for you--but it was really annoying since I was expecting a zippy recovery due to being young and because, like you, I had the surgery, late spring/early summer and was impatient to just ride my damn bike.

There's a fair few meta analyses out there that show that there is no real discernable effect of most progesterone contraceptives and thrombosis. The only ones they tend to identify are higher dose medications such as the depot contraceptive (the mirena being the lowest dose preparation).

There's enough evidence to suggest it's safe. Obviously everything comes at risk, and they only way to pick it apart (to see things like tiny increase in risk) is to do absolutely massive studies, which are not always possible. The thrombosis UK society/charity is happy to tell those with clotting disorders that the low dose progesterone medications are safe.

If I offer surgery I essentially also offer a risk of organ damage, risk of needing a stoma/colostomy, I aslo offer a risk of failure to treat anything. Whilst these risks are low, they would not occur without the surgery, and even the best surgeon will have a risk of these complications being about the same as average as each patient presents a different challenge.

Needless to say, I'm happy to offer it if I think it's suitable, but it's not necessarily the get out of jail free card a lot of people thing it will be.

 A lot of the issues are mainly on the patient understanding of how the disease works, it makes a lot of the journey for them much easier. The onus is on us to explain it properly. Time is always a struggle in clinic as it takes a while to explain endometriosis and I have 20 minutes to take a history, examine and explain/come up with a plan. I tend to focus a lot of time on the explaining part, as well as explaining where the journey may go. So I guess my frustration comes with clinic timing more than anything.

One of the things you can do as a patient is ask what happens next if things work, or don't work. You can also. Ask about the processes they are trying to correct.

Women are statistically far more likely to live in poverty than men, yet they also statistically live longer. Clearly there's something more than class at play here. 

The fact is, women are more likely to see a doctor and follow the doctor's instructions, while men all too frequently don't go to the doctor at all because they think seeing a doctor is weak. That's not class, that's toxic masculinity.

seek and ye shall find.

here's the [actual study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790261?resultClick=3)

the CUD checklist is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click on image to zoom&p=PMC3&id=3767415_nihms515995f1.jpg).

table two in the study above indicates that a score of 0-11 is assigned to CUD severity.  A +1 given for each of the x's in the rightmost column from the DSM-5 checklist.  The mean score reached at most 0.55 out of 11 with a standard deviation of .95 for CUD severity, meaning that some people reported ~~one or~~ two or more criteria such as a craving or increased tolerance.

I'd like to be open minded about these kinds of studies, and so I *do* look at them genuinely and try to keep my personal bias in check, but it's difficult not to look at this study as someone stretching a canvas over their own predisposition.

If I've got my facts wrong I'd genuinely welcome someone to correct me.  I couldn't find a CUD specific checklist so I *am* presuming that the general substance abuse checklist is the one they're talking about.

E*: as per [this](https://www.anorton.com/userfiles/688392/file/DSM-5%20SUD%20Checklist.pdf) checklist, a CUD diagnosis is two or more of these symptoms, not one or two.  you can also find more specific data on CUD reports [here](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/938870/zoi220094supp2_prod_1647021149.91402.pdf?Expires=1650810694&Signature=rVIpDET9GzqQgcb5wxUSiUyCXZwuv4tGy-3IZ68mjd7xVQswJaqSgYjI5GRp-p2HvXw45dv6wjXg8nzTqzZyvmrXksB1o8dlpxUsOkxJiim6K0mJoknrqpnCg9Re-Qg7LPNrW-4RUZxKuw27MGDRl0Wa6d4x2oxrkJuOHGD1wn~OtOzOHSxFPpLjV-kPy5NJYjXezRpVSGgaDFsQD12nBjQrLYGTc6t1mL-VWo-~B0f00pkeQ7BKxS-MDZwWPORHowgtkzvQH3JX-kStoEmAq8ZS1CqRLtxtHZDpA68FzsQRahsAc9p1ItfgLAK-KubNKhL0gBilva5F1XCtZReGGA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) in etable 6 and 7",1647780682.0,5121

The team found that the odds of developing CUD were nearly two times higher in the MMC cohort than in the wait list control group, and that by week 12, 10 percent of the MMC group had developed a CUD diagnosis, with the number rising to 20 percent in those seeking a card for anxiety or depression.""


Wow, yeah I'm not surprised the people with access to Marijuana developed some kind of dependency with it over 12 weeks in comparison to the group that didn't even have fake marijuana ( almost 0%THC) but were told they were smoking the real thing etc. Then only 20% said they wanted the card for anxiety and depression which we all know is something people just say so they can get the medical card because the doctor can't prove you don't have it.",1647777265.0,1

The study was more directly looking at the fallout from the fact that patients can receive a medical marijuana card without any counseling, help with dosing, or any medical or psychological follow up at all. The title is certainly misleading; what the press release (this is not a scientific article nor an abstract but a third party’s press release) states is that what the study found is that 10% of people who immediately received a medical marijuana card did not report an improvement on their pain, anxiety or depression symptoms but did develop  a substance use disorder— which they defined as increased tolerance to weed and continued use of weed even if it was not helping or causing further problems. The doubling point comes from if you were using weed for anxiety or depression and not pain, there was a 20% chance that you did not report improvement in symptoms and also developed a substance use disorder. So the title is just incorrect.

Researchers found that individuals at greatest risk of developing the addictive symptoms of CUD were those seeking relief from anxiety and depression, suggesting the need for stronger safeguards over the dispensing, use, and professional follow-up of people who legally obtain cannabis through MMCs.

“There have been many claims about the benefits of medical marijuana for treating pain, insomnia, anxiety and depression, without sound scientific evidence to support them,” says lead author Jodi Gilman, PhD, with the Center for Addiction Medicine at MGH. “In this first study of patients randomized to obtain medical marijuana cards, we learned there can be negative consequences to using cannabis for medical purposes. People with pain, anxiety or depression symptoms failed to report any improvements, though those with insomnia experienced improved sleep.” Particularly disturbing to Gilman was the fact individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression -- the most common conditions for which medical cannabis is sought -- were most vulnerable to developing cannabis use disorder. CUD symptoms include the need for more cannabis to overcome drug tolerance, and continued use despite physical or psychological problems caused by the cannabis.”

You say:

>	The mean score reached at most 0.55 out of 11 with a standard deviation of .95 for CUD severity, meaning that some people reported one or two criteria such as a craving or increased tolerance.

Everything before the comma there is factual, but everything after the comma minimizes these findings.

The authors note about 1 in 5 participants developed CUD. Per the DSM-5, a minimum of two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of CUD. That means that 1 in 5 participants developed two or more symptoms, with that proportion increasing to 1 in 4 among those being treated for anxiety or depression. The authors note that most of the participants who developed CUD showed between two and four symptoms. (i.e., mild CUD). These numbers are more notable when you consider that fewer than half of that proportion (less than 1 in 10) who didn’t get a medical marijuana card developed CUD.

There’s lots to argue about here. You might think the included symptoms are bogus. You might think two symptoms is too few (though the authors didn’t make that number up, it’s the actual DSM criteria). You might think the trade off is worth it. All of those are reasonable thoughts, but don’t change the finding that people in this study given a medical marijuana card were more than twice as likely to develop a cannabis use disorder.

To me, the more interesting finding is a lack of change in average pain severity among those using marijuana and the fact that those using marijuana to treat anxiety and depression were at much higher risk for developing CUD than other participants were. This strongly suggests that those using marijuana for anxiety and depression are using marijuana differently and likely in more concerning ways.

You have a health issue that can help, albeit momentarily, with something. And now that you've grown dependant on I it, it became a problem because you realized you were dependant on it?
Thats weird logic, you should fint it problematic if it's an actual problem causing you some form of harm. Not because you're told it's bad to have an addiction.

People are addicted to all kinds of things it starts being a problem when it hinders you in any way or if it becomes a thing that degrades your health. Neither are things cannabis sounds like it's doing to you. Cannabis isn't bad in of itself. The act of smoking is bad. But ingestion of cannabis has shown very little worrisome results. It has the ability to make an addiction sure. It can also push forward mental issues like psychosis. But what we know right now it isn't clear why it's even illegal.

The problem with indica and sativa is that it's a phenotype description of the leaves. People need to shift to a chemotype based description for cannabis, this would be in reference to the secondary metabolites. The couch lock phenomenon is caused by having the right mixture of cannabinoids, primarily a high concentration of delta-9 THC and CBN, both of those cannabinoids create strong sopoforic(sleepy/drowsiness) effects. Another thing that can increase these effects would be a handful of terpenes that can interact with cannabinoids like linalool and myrcene.

They were not examining whether weed works for these symptoms compared to placebo.

Wax is very easy to dose, i make a gram last well over a week, and unless i mess up the dose and my eyes turn red, nobody can usually tell ive smoked.

Then quitted for many years and decided to give it a go out of boredom during the lockdown.

Me being a stubborn motherfucker decided that that terrible experience wasn't going to stop me from trying to escape from the boredom and kept trying on subsequent occasions during the next weeks. 

Kept getting way too high for a while until the tolerance rised and then it was business as usual, problem with that is that then the use intensified from weekend nights to daily evenings until I decided to quit again as I didn't want to become what I was before.

>In this retrograde signalling process, excessive stimulation of a post-synaptic neuron releases endogenous cannabinoids that act on presynaptic receptors located on glutamatergic excitatory neurons to reduce hyper-excitability and possibly prevent seizures. However in vivo, the circuitry is often more complex, with presynaptic CB1 receptors located on both GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals75–77. The endogenous cannabinoids modulate neuronal excitability of brain circuits by regulating both GABA and glutamate release. The overall net effect depends on multiple factors such as the degree of expression of CB1 in GABAergic versus glutamatergic neurons, the anatomy of the local circuit and the signalling efficacy in each neuron, which may differ based on brain areas.

>CB1 receptor stimulation can indirectly activate the dopaminergic system that mediates the rewarding effects of many drugs (FIG. 3). Although CB1 receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain, dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain do not express CB1 receptors75. It is most likely that THC indirectly increases dopaminergic activity by influencing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain78. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), CB1 receptors are primarily located on GABAergic neurons (as opposed to glutamatergic neurons). One proposal is that THC activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors on VTA GABAergic neurons inhibits presynaptic GABA release, allowing dopaminergic neurons in the VTA to fire78. In two small human PET imaging studies, THC significantly increased dopamine release in the limbic striatum79. The increase in dopamine levels was much smaller than that elicited by psychostimulant drugs80 and more like the changes produced by alcohol.

>**Humans who cease regular cannabis use can also experience a withdrawal syndrome** (see Diagnosis, screening and prevention, below). In some PET imaging studies, the availability of CB1 receptors was negatively associated with severity of withdrawal symptoms94, suggesting a direct role for CB1 receptors in cannabis withdrawal. The intensity of cannabis withdrawal was reduced by CB1 agonists such as dronabinol or nabilone93,95 or nabiximols (which is a ~1:1 combination of THC and CBD)96. The blockade of FAAH to enhance anandamide levels is another potential way to reduce withdrawal symptoms97.

>Acute Effects and Insight into Reinforcing/Addictive Properties of Cannabis

>All drugs of abuse increase DA release — a key neurobiological process that generates their reinforcing effects (Koob and Volkow 2016). Here we evaluate the acute changes in DA circuitry associated with cannabis intake in preclinical and clinical studies that provide basis for the reinforcing effects of cannabis. While the two main constituents of cannabis are delta9-tetrahydracannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), THC seems to be responsible for cannabis’ addictive potential due to its psychoactive properties and associated effects on brain dopaminergic function. Acute THC administration elicits striatal DA release in animals (Ng Cheong Ton et al. 1988) and humans (Stokes et al. 2010; Bossong et al. 2015; Bloomfield et al. 2016). However, another study found no evidence for THC-induced DA release (Barkus et al. 2011); this may be because THC induces quantitatively less DA release than psychostimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamine (Volkow et al. 1999a). Nonetheless, these findings suggest that THC increases DA release similar to other drugs of abuse.

Clearly dose dependent, but with indirect GABA/glutamate/dopamine effects via cannabinoid release, it's no surprise the withdrawal symptoms take the appearance of a less dangerous, much shorter, and more mild version of simultaneous benzodiazepine and stimulant withdrawal.",1647776728.0,-4

There's almost a full consensus that there's a high likelihood of causality with adolescent use leading to mental health problems later in life.

Like alcohol, it's not as safe as a lot of people assume it is, but unlike alcohol, these problems seem to manifest not as dependent addiction but mental health issues on their own where it's subsequent use is for coping with generalized mental health problems. 

Last I checked, the biggest issue is that studying mental health - especially causality of mental health problems - is really hard in general and has a history of not being researched well, and the problem in studying adults with ready access is it can be near impossible to tell whether or not these substances are in use before or after their mental health problems were able to be diagnosed, let alone fully-casually linked.

What data we do have (and generally supported by the anecdotes of people I know) suggests long-term periods of not using improves mental health after periods of frequent use.

I smoke daily myself so this isn’t coming from someone who is anti drug. In fact I think cannabis is pretty good overall in comparison to other drugs and treatments but I feel that the culture around weed is the issue. Before weed was banned originally you could go down to your apothecary to get some and they’d tell you how to use it and how much. Once it was pushed underground and made illegal the “pot head” culture sprung up to fill the void. Potency back then was waaaay different than standard strains now. Now with just about everything being 20%+ thc with no cbd (the antidote to the neurotoxic effects of thc) there is a lot higher chance for down regulation, paranoia, etc. 

Smoking 20+ % bud every night is, in my opinion, like drinking hard liquor every night. If people had instead been introduced to weed at something like 6%thc, 12% cbd like more classical weed I think everybody’s… habit… would be closer to drinking a beer after work.

Anecdotally, I smoked pot for nearly 20 years. I stopped three months ago because I'm not interested in other methods of consumption, and I was in the process of quitting tobacco. As I personally had created an association between the two, and tobacco is known to be both psychologically and physically addictive, it was only logical to also remove my cannabis habit lest it led to relapse into my tobacco consumption.

Globally, we’ve done *very* little scientific research on cannabis use, recreational or medicinal. This lack of research encompasses Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). Personally, I should read more about it. But what I do know is this: It does seem to be a real disorder that happens to _some_ cannabis users after prolonged, repeated cannabis usage. It can be short-term or permanent. That being said, if we’ve only been studying CUD for a few years, how do we know it will actually be “permanent?” Theoretically, every person with CUD could suddenly recover from it in the next two years. And then it wouldn’t be considered “permanent” any more. Does that make sense how I’m explaining it? 

When looking at cannabis studies, we have to be careful because it’s a subject rife with misinformation. This is from both sides - those against cannabis usage and those for legal cannabis use. One side is highly biased due to a long history of demonizing marijuana. The other side knows cannabis has benefits, but doesn’t have much hard evidence to support their claims.

>Proponents of cannabis generally dismiss the idea that there is a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. One routinely hears statements such as, “I smoked weed every day for 30 years and then just walked away from it without any problems. It’s not addictive.” Some cannabis researchers, on the other hand, describe serious withdrawal symptoms that can include aggression, anger, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, depression, restlessness, headaches, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Given this long list of withdrawal symptoms, it’s a wonder that anyone tries to reduce or stop using cannabis. Why is there such a disconnect between researchers’ findings and the lived reality of cannabis users?
  
>A recent meta-analysis published in JAMA cites the overall prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome as 47% among “individuals with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids.” The authors of the study raise the alarm that “many professionals and members of the general public may not be aware of cannabis withdrawal, potentially leading to confusion about the benefits of cannabis to treat or self-medicate symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders.” In other words, many patients using medical cannabis to “treat” their symptoms are merely caught up in a cycle of self-treating their cannabis withdrawal.

>In this retrograde signalling process, excessive stimulation of a post-synaptic neuron releases endogenous cannabinoids that act on presynaptic receptors located on glutamatergic excitatory neurons to reduce hyper-excitability and possibly prevent seizures. However in vivo, the circuitry is often more complex, with presynaptic CB1 receptors located on both GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals75–77. The endogenous cannabinoids modulate neuronal excitability of brain circuits by regulating both GABA and glutamate release. The overall net effect depends on multiple factors such as the degree of expression of CB1 in GABAergic versus glutamatergic neurons, the anatomy of the local circuit and the signalling efficacy in each neuron, which may differ based on brain areas.

>CB1 receptor stimulation can indirectly activate the dopaminergic system that mediates the rewarding effects of many drugs (FIG. 3). Although CB1 receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain, dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain do not express CB1 receptors75. It is most likely that THC indirectly increases dopaminergic activity by influencing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain78. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), CB1 receptors are primarily located on GABAergic neurons (as opposed to glutamatergic neurons). One proposal is that THC activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors on VTA GABAergic neurons inhibits presynaptic GABA release, allowing dopaminergic neurons in the VTA to fire78. In two small human PET imaging studies, THC significantly increased dopamine release in the limbic striatum79. The increase in dopamine levels was much smaller than that elicited by psychostimulant drugs80 and more like the changes produced by alcohol.

>**Humans who cease regular cannabis use can also experience a withdrawal syndrome** (see Diagnosis, screening and prevention, below). In some PET imaging studies, the availability of CB1 receptors was negatively associated with severity of withdrawal symptoms94, suggesting a direct role for CB1 receptors in cannabis withdrawal.

>In this retrograde signalling process, excessive stimulation of a post-synaptic neuron releases endogenous cannabinoids that act on presynaptic receptors located on glutamatergic excitatory neurons to reduce hyper-excitability and possibly prevent seizures. However in vivo, the circuitry is often more complex, with presynaptic CB1 receptors located on both GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals75–77. The endogenous cannabinoids modulate neuronal excitability of brain circuits by regulating both GABA and glutamate release. The overall net effect depends on multiple factors such as the degree of expression of CB1 in GABAergic versus glutamatergic neurons, the anatomy of the local circuit and the signalling efficacy in each neuron, which may differ based on brain areas.

>CB1 receptor stimulation can indirectly activate the dopaminergic system that mediates the rewarding effects of many drugs (FIG. 3). Although CB1 receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain, dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain do not express CB1 receptors75. It is most likely that THC indirectly increases dopaminergic activity by influencing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain78. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), CB1 receptors are primarily located on GABAergic neurons (as opposed to glutamatergic neurons). One proposal is that THC activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors on VTA GABAergic neurons inhibits presynaptic GABA release, allowing dopaminergic neurons in the VTA to fire78. In two small human PET imaging studies, THC significantly increased dopamine release in the limbic striatum79. The increase in dopamine levels was much smaller than that elicited by psychostimulant drugs80 and more like the changes produced by alcohol.

>**Humans who cease regular cannabis use can also experience a withdrawal syndrome** (see Diagnosis, screening and prevention, below). In some PET imaging studies, the availability of CB1 receptors was negatively associated with severity of withdrawal symptoms94, suggesting a direct role for CB1 receptors in cannabis withdrawal. The intensity of cannabis withdrawal was reduced by CB1 agonists such as dronabinol or nabilone93,95 or nabiximols (which is a ~1:1 combination of THC and CBD)96.

Assuming you’re asking in good faith and want to know, and are not just being argumentative:

The kidney injury is the reason they are admitted in the first place from the ED. The kidney injury is due to dehydration. It is resolved by IV fluids and antiemetics. The dehydration is caused by vomiting. The vomiting is then worked up to make sure nothing is missed as a cause of the vomiting. This is the negative work up I was referring to. No organic cause of vomiting other than the Cannabis use is found.

After rehydration and a little time (usually 3 to 4 days) they feel better and are discharged. A few weeks later they are back in the hospital for the same thing.

The differential for a negative work up includes other things such as Rumination Syndrome, Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, Munchausen, and Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Again, no physician is just going to write a patient off. They are considering all of these things all of the time and weighing them against one another based on the info they have. Along these lines there are often tell-tale signs that it is Cannabinoid induced (along with the positive UDS). One of these signs is that almost every time you walk into the patient’s room they are in the shower. For whatever reason the nausea and abdominal discomfort from CHS tends to feel better with warm showers.

So chemists, astronomers and many more worked to find reaction pathways to look at how they are forming. One of the brightest ideas currently being worked on is solid state reactions occuring on interstellar grains. These grains accrete molecules from the gas phase forming a layer of ice of many different types of molecules. These molecules are then ""hit"" by what's called galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) which deposit energy into the molecules and form highly reactive radicals, which then form more complex molecules. The reason radiation in the form of GCRs is so important is because of how cold the molecular cloud is. Most chemical reactions occur thermally (that is at temperatures we are used to or more) rather than 10K. So, effectively production of GCRs create the peptides as they bombard the molecular cloud with energy that stimulates chemical reactions.",1647737668.0,17

The required general organic chemistry isn't THAT materially different.

Also the fragment ""peptides OR proteins"" is a NOT trivial distinction. One that does have implications for the ""math"" comparing panspermia to eathcentric.

Generally speaking the ""blocks"" (Amino acids, nucleotides, fatic acids) are less problematic. The ""still somewhat problematic step"" is the kinetics of unassisted chain elongation vs link breakage, and how to get to a critical threshold of self catalysis. (regardless of which ""branch"" is supposed to be first.)

Which, ironically is on the surface just another version of the clockmakers fallacy... just minus the fallacy part.
It's interesting to realise that while polymerisation is energetically favoured, there is a problem with entropy for longer chains. AS the chain grows, the number (and thus individual equilibriums) of breakpoints rises, while the math for elongation doesn't. So the logical conclusion is an equilibrium of length where elongation and breaking (anywhere) balance out. And if that length is below the threshold for conceiving a valid model for self replication, that's trouble.

So having evidence that the building blocks can exist outside earths potential conditions means you can extend the potential conditions for chain elongation.",1647793226.0,1

Which is, again, less than really relevant, because it's 2 steps past the actual ""problem"". Nor is it REALLY what the paper is claiming.

In essence the paper is Organic chemistry proposing that due to the increase in ""reactor size"" to a cosmic scale to output peptides of lengths ~10/15, it closes a scarcity gap of trying to explain the sourcing for them in watery solutions on earth.

It's nice and well to point at ribocymez. But the ""issue"" is that the ""site specific cutting"" requires ~80+ base sequence specific RNA molecules cycling over changing ion titrations and temperatures...

Which is nice, and surely part of the picture in terms of simplest things once you already HAVE selfreplicating systems. But basically the 80 BP+ are JUST for arguing small independent fragmenst over ""a blop"" that keeps on growing and adding to itself in a repeating pattern once you HAVE self catalysis.

Ice VII is normally cubic so this does represent a new phase, but it’s a *very* subtle change and it remains very similar to VII so they’ve decided to call it ice VIIt instead. 

Also, there is also no official body that decides the numbers of ice polymorphism so it’s kind of up to the authors what they do. They could have called it ice XVI if the wanted.

This phase of ice could exists in abundance in expected water-rich planets outside of our solar system, meaning they could have conditions habitable for life",,1647697468.0,629,22546,0.94,gavilin,"As someone with a bit of a chemistry background, I can try to explain. To have life, you need a way to store information in molecules that can be replicated. Carbon chains are some of the most flexible chemicals in terms of stability and also ease of covalent bonding with a range of atoms, forming more complicated functional groups. The issue is there are a finite number of elements to work with. About 90 or so. Carbon is the best of these. Water is then a useful choice because it has oxygen and hydrogen in it, two of the elements that work best with carbon.

Next, you need life to be in the liquid phase. That's just a practical issue. Gases will just float apart, and solids don't really work because if I have a pile of nutrients over here and a pile of nutrients over there that need to mix, they don't just jump onto each other. liquids naturally facilitate the mixing of chemicals, and so all life that we know of is liquid-based (your cells are full of liquid, called cytoplasm).

Once you have down that it needs to be a liquid, and you need to use carbon, you get restricted a bit in terms of temperature, because too hot and the carbon molecules you built out of carbon start to fall apart, and too cold and the reaction rates necessary for life get too slow (this is intuitive but reactions happen slower or not at all at low temperatures). So not too hot, not too cold.

The last piece is you really need a solvent that is polar. This means that it has positive and negative ends. That's because polar solvents can dissolve other polar molecules (letting them move around) but don't dissolve non-polar molecules (so they can stay put together and do things). Having this ability to have some things get moved around and others stay together points to having a polar solvent, and Water happens to be a very polar solvent.

Water ticks all of these boxes better than basically anything else. It's possible you could have life in a different liquid solvent like Dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol, but these other choices are either more complicated and unlikely to form a lot of naturally, or are too unstable and could lead to chain reactions with oxygen that result in the production of water anyway.",1647704914.0,13

This transition is between two phases of solid water.  So as one went down the water column at the relevant P-T regime, you would see first liquid water, then ice-VII, then this phase ice-VIIt, then ice-X.  Sequestration by a solid phase has already happened but he time this polymorph is relevant.

It’s possible that microbial life could exist at the interstice of ice crystals  at *some* elevated pressure, assuming the formation of a eutectic formed by dissolved ions, but that’s not relevant here.  Further, this structure is the more rigid one, which suggests such a space would be smaller. That’s not to mention the pressure regime is absurd.  Polymerization, or any other reaction that results in a positive change to standard molar volume, is thermodynamically disfavored at high pressure.

Finally, mineral (and dissolved ion) content in our ocean is largely derived from continental processes for a number of geochemical reasons that would hold on other planets, too.

The article covers CO2 which does sublimates in solid form but it doesn’t not cover Dry Ice which isn’t a scientific term it’s a branding you can check out yourself, it was trade marked in the 1920’s.

Edit: A good topical example would be the word condensation or condensate.

In organic chemistry a condensate or condensation is the term used for a specific reaction when molecules are combined at the loss/explosion of a water molecule.

it was published in the papers that he died drunk in a gutter. They said that he was an alcoholic all his life and it led him to die such a way in his 40s. 

Truth is he was INCREDIBLY sensitive to alcohol. A single sip could make him sick. He also actually died in a hospital from what is becoming commonly recognised as rabies. The article written and then republished everywhere was by a man whom Poe had reviewed harshly earlier in his career. (Poe had a very popular critique column) 


#Additional additional fun fact!!!: 

At the time that Poe died it was not uncommon to find dead people on the streets reeking of alcohol. This was because there were several people who, when voting time came around, would go to bars, find a local drunk, and use them. By that I mean take them to the polls, have them vote for someone then take them , dress them in different clothes and then have them vote again , then repeat, repeat, repeat. They would ply them with alcohol till the drunk passed out at which point they would be dumped in the street.

How the part in question starts.

>We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words:  
>  
>""He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Théâtre des Variétés.""  
>  
>""There can be no doubt of that,"" I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.     
>  
>""Dupin,"" said I, gravely, ""this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of \_\_\_ ?"" Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.

They test shot an encyclopedia beforehand but book was propped against a solid wall and the bullet never pierced the book.

edit: conservation of momentum and conservation of energy are the physics laws involved. the same laws are seen in a Newton's cradle. the bullet is both pushing and tearing the target (elastic and inelastic). the heavier the target, the more impulse energy is used up pushing the object and there is less energy to tear into the target.

I'm a little confused about how 30 people in rural MN didnt realize the danger of a deagle through a small book. As someone from semi rural MN, not from a family of gun nuts but friends with many, plenty of us would have immediately stopped them. Is rural MN really that stupid? I have relatives from way up there and *they're* very responsible with guns, but the mom and dad were cops so probably not the best representation of the area

Edit:

A man accidentally shot dead his wife while trying to install a TV satellite system in his bedroom.
Ronald Long had been unable to punch a hole through one of his exterior walls in Missouri, U.S.

So he used his .22 calibre handgun to fire two shots into the wall to make a hole big enough for a cable to run through from the outside satellite dish.

Tragically his wife Patsy, 34, who was standing outside the house was hit.

If anyone had asked me I would've assumed a thick book would have enough mass compared to a bullet that it wouldn't matter whether or not the book was allowed to move, since the fraction of momentum the bullet retains is basically the ratio of their masses.

It's obviously a pointlessly dangerous idea to shoot a gun at someone but he probably used a reasonable line if thinking to ""make sure"" it was safe before getting shot at. Maybe he thought:

 • Books or coins in people's pockets stop bullets in movies

 • Bulletproof vests work on a similar principle and are perfectly capable of preventing death

 • If I can find a thick enough book, maybe I can use it to block a bullet

 • I got a thick book and shot it with a small gun, it only damaged a few pages

 • I got a bigger gun and shot the thickest book I have, and it only went in 1/4"" into the 1.5"" book (I'm just speculating here)

 • This book is six times thicker than needed to stop a bullet, so even if there were any small variations the book is going to be virtually 100% effective at stopping bullets

 • If the gun is shot at me, the only way I'll die is if it misses the book

 • Shooting the book point-blank makes it impossible to miss

 • This would be a sick YouTube video

This was a time period when prepubescent boys were sent off as larval officers on naval ships and expected to fight in combat *as* officers.

That is actually been covered in a different post on this sub. Like I said, Mozart and his father had a complicated relationship due the fact he wasn't exactly father of the year at times.  He did without a doubt absolutely try to do his dead level best he could by his son *and* daughter to secure them successful places in the world.  

Much of the friction between them wasn't as a result of Mozart as a young child or even teenager as he was generally described as a soft sensitive sort of kid.  Much of the friction came later in life when Wolfgang, a more impulsive sort than his father, wanted to make his own mark and legacy beyond that of being a child prodigy.  Leopold wanted his son to take the sure money and a steady paycheck, Wolfgang wanted fame and glory to a degree.  In some ways there are some parallels in that between Leopold and Wolfgang.  Leopold a brilliant violinist and composer of note himself was out shined by his child prodigy son.  Wolfgang had problems with being seen as a composer in his own right instead of a performer and ""that kid that played violin"".   Also, Leopold did not exactly have a great relationship with Constanze and this too was a sometimes source of friction as Wolfgang was absolutely devoted to her.  

The fact that Mozart didn't attend his father's funeral is not overwhelmingly significant in and of itself because it takes 3 days for the mail to get from Vienna to Salzburg in the late 1700s. By the time Mozart could have conceivably gotten there his father would have been buried already. The fact that Mozart threw a lavish party for the death of a pet songbird a week later was probably a transfer of mourning.",1647791066.0,1
