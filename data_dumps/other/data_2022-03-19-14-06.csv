Military flame throwers throw flammable liquid or gel which lets it travel further and burn longer. Those are more scary, but they are generally more complicated than a blow torch.

I‚Äôm learning about this in my forestry class. Most areas traditionally had a short burn cycle, frequent small fires that many trees adapted to: ponderosa pine‚Äôs thick bark and self pruning, lodgepole pine‚Äôs serotinous cones, sealed with resin, these open up at high temps and disperse seeds. 

Once we started fighting wild fires, fuel (dead plant matter) builds up, making for the huge fires we‚Äôve been seeing recently.

In my area, a prescribed burn (simulating natural fire) got really out of hand due to unforeseen wind like 20 years ago, causing a ban on prescribed burns. Then two years ago we get one of the worst fires in local history- now we can prescribe burns again. Its risky but its a natural process that we have to respect if we want to lessen intense forest fires and cultivate forest health.",1647721783.0,2

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.",1647720849.0,1

First you get a thick log, maybe one and a half fists thick. Then you carve the tip into a blunt bullet shape. Too sharp and the spike will go through the victim too fast. Too blunt, and the victim won't be properly impaled.    

You grease up the spike with lard. You insert the bullet shaped end into the victim's anus. You push it in to at least a foot or more is in the victim. Then you haul them up.   

If you've calculated everything right, then the victim will remain alive, twitching, and completely unable to stop what is happening to him *or her* (yes this happened to women too) for days. Ultimately, the spike will erupt from the upper chest, back, or head. Fortunately, the victim will have died before then.

Colorado, 1864

A volunteer military group of over 600 men from the 3rd Colorado Cavalry march through the cold November night to attack a settlement of Cheyenne & Arapaho natives at dawn.

The braves were away, so there's barely any defense. The cavalry leader knew this. The 3rd Cavalry wind up killing over 150 natives, most of which are women and children.

Of the men they killed, they cut off their penises for trophies.

Why do all this?

Because the 3rd Colorado Cavalry hadn't seen any combat throughout their service and were being disbanded soon. They were mocked as the ""Bloodless 3rd"". Their leader, Col. James Covington, wanted to give them ""glory"" before they disbanded.

Chinese men were used for bayonet practice and in decapitation contests. An estimated 20,000 ‚Äì 80,000 Chinese women were raped. Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, and nail them alive to walls. Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs, and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them get torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified, one proclaiming the massacre to be the work of bestial machinery.‚Äù[5]",1647678545.0,967

>‚ÄúIn all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:  
  
1. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor‚Äôd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.  
  
2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.  
  
3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc‚Äôd may be attended with much Inconvenience.  
  
4. Because thro‚Äô more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin‚Äôd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.  
  
5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.  
  
6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.  
  
7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.  
  
8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!‚Äù

¬´¬†My sweet little whorish Nora,

I did as you told me, you dirty little girl, and pulled myself off twice when I read your letter. I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora‚Äôs fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.¬†¬ª

Eleanor hated when Churchill visited.  He would get FDR to stay up late drinking.  He'd also barge into their room when he had an idea late at night. 

Eventually, he was housed at the Blair House across the street from the White House.  That started the tradition of visiting heads of states would stay there, a tradition that lives on to this day.

They had a reputation as the strongest land power partially due to being one of the few poleis with a professional army, and specially due to the large network of allies that supported them. Later they had their asses kicked hardly by Thebes, and they lost that network, so they never recovered from that. 

They weren't particularly fearsome. Also, contrary to the popular belief, their training consisted in many other activities, like music. The agoge was probably more designed to make good citizens than good soldiers. 

What makes Sparta particular is how harsh and controlling their society was, regarding citizens. There's accounts of Spartans partying and getting loose on the rare occasion that they weren't in their own territory. 

My personal impression is that it was a very conservative power, socially and politically speaking. They valued stability to a fault. They were very afraid to lose their system of alliances, and specially of an helot (serf/lower class) rebellion, which was their backbone. Staying too much time outside the Peloponnese could mean that Sparta would be burn to the ground when you returned. 

By contrast, Athens, the ""democratic"" power, was far more imperialist and aggressive than people assume. They were more hostile against the Persians, and they also engaged in far riskier campaigns against other Greeks. Their status as an economic major power, their higher personal wealth, their cosmopolitan culture, the strength of their navy, and their tendency to fight in wars far away reminds me of the modern US. 

There's been a lot said about how Sparta treated the Helots, but from what it seems, they had considerably more right than a slave. The fact that they were so afraid of a rebellion shows that they hold a fair degree of power, compared to a slave. 

By contrast, one of the major strenghts of Athenian economy, their silver Drachma, was built on the work of mining slaves, which was probably one of the most brutal conditions in ancient history. 

That was kind of an uncalled rant, tbh. I just like to discuss about Greek history, specially dismantling the myths.",1647671060.0,2457

King Henry VI was in Erfurt to settle a very long dispute between Louis III of Thuringia and Archbishop Conrad of Mainz. Their blood feud had been going on for years. 

So, being a good king, Henry began assembling local nobles and dignitaries to the Petersburg Citadel in Erfurt to mediate the dispute. Both parties raised hell over this. Because their fight had been going on for so long, Conrad and Louis argued that no local landowner could offer an unbiased judgement. So Henry called on landowners from further away, and used his traveling party to help arbitrate the dispute. Because Henry‚Äôs traveling party was weighed down with lavish clothing and jewelry, the floor collapsed, causing the arbitrators to fall in the cesspool. Henry only survived because he fell onto the first floor doorway. 

But here‚Äôs the wild part to me. Neither party died in the disaster (apparently it was custom at the time for both parties to arrive last in this sort of meeting), and after seeing dozens of men literally drown in shit to solve their dispute, the two men promptly.. *kept fighting each other*.

Apparently the plant may have been recently rediscovered in Greece (not it's native range). About a dozen plants were found in various ancient walled orchards. The plant matches descriptions from antiquity including: seed shape, resin color and smell, rough growth pattern, growing requirements, etc. As a bonus, it contains a bunch of previously unknown bioactive compounds. The team that discovered it successfully got about half a dozen to sprout and have transplanted them back into the area they found them, as well as keeping a few for research. There are very few known samples, and with it's supposed aphrodisiac qualities they are worried people will start harvesting the few wild plants for penis pills.

The trick to growing them? The seeds need cold stratification, not something that's super common in it's native Syrian range.

So their whole strategy became hinged on giving Hannibal two bad options - spread yourself thin holding territory, or watch us take it back. The Romans would simply let Hannibal take whatever he wanted, and meanwhile, they'd take back whatever he took the week before. 

This tactic comes from a guy name Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, or The Cuncator (The Delayer). He was the originator of Fabian tactics - cutting supply lines, only taking favorable engagements, using the land. 

Hannibal tried to resolve this by pacting with Syracuse in order to control Sicily and give himself a supply route. The Romans snuck into the city at night and the Carthaginians developed plague. Once Rome controlled Sicily and Syracuse again,  Carthage had no supply lines.

Publius Cornelius Scipio, later Scipio Africanus - ends up pulling off a brilliant strategy where he manages to sneak away several thousand troops from the main force to join his, and proceeds to kill Hannibal's less talented brother, Hasdrubal, who'd rocked up with 30k fresh men. The Romans lobbed his head into Hannibal's camp.

An uncontrolled¬†nuclear fission¬†began immediately. The resulting nuclear fission chain became¬†self-sustaining, emitting intense¬†gamma¬†and¬†neutron radiation.[1]¬†At the time of the event, Ouchi had his body draped over the tank while Shinohara stood on a platform to assist in pouring the solution. Yokokawa was sitting at a desk four meters away.[13]¬†All three technicians observed a¬†blue flash¬†(possibly¬†Cherenkov radiation) and gamma radiation alarms sounded.[16]¬†Over the next several hours the fission reaction produced continuous chain reactions.
Ouchi and Shinohara immediately experienced pain, nausea, and difficulty breathing. Ouchi received the largest radiation exposure, resulting in rapid difficulties with mobility, coherence, and loss of consciousness.[13]


Hisashi Ouchi, 35, was transported and treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital for 83 days.[21]¬†Ouchi suffered serious radiation burns to most of his body, experienced severe damage to his internal organs, and had a near-zero¬†white blood cell¬†count. Without a functioning immune system, Ouchi was vulnerable to¬†hospital-borne pathogens¬†and was placed in a special radiation ward to limit the risk of contracting an infection.[22]¬†Doctors attempted to restore some functionality to Ouchi's immune system by administering¬†peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, which at the time was a new form of treatment.[10]¬†After receiving the transplant from his sister, Ouchi initially experienced increased white blood cell counts temporarily but succumbed to his other injuries shortly thereafter.[21]¬†The leukocytes being produced by the transplanted tissue were found to have been mutated by the residual radiation present in his body, triggering¬†autoimmune responses¬†that exacerbated his rapidly deteriorating condition, and white blood cell counts began to decrease.[10]¬†Numerous other interventions were conducted in an attempt to arrest further decline of Ouchi's severely damaged body, including repeated use of cultured skin grafts and pharmacological interventions with¬†painkillers,¬†broad-spectrum antibiotics¬†and¬†granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, without any measurable success.[23]

At the wishes of his family, doctors repeatedly revived Ouchi when his heart stopped, even as it became clear the damage his body had sustained through radiation was untreatable. Despite their efforts, his condition deteriorated into¬†multiple organ failure¬†resulting from extensive radiation damage, exacerbated by the repeated incidents where Ouchi's heart stopped. He died on 21 December 1999 following an unrecoverable cardiac arrest.[24]",1647698738.0,572

It took forever to get it scheduled and the only reason it did was because I pushed for it. The symptoms have been getting worse but every time I go to my mom about it she says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a nodule,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs not as bad as you‚Äôre making it,‚Äù etc. Does she think it‚Äôs normal for my breathing to be difficult? I know it‚Äôs petty but part of me is hoping I do have a nodule so I can tell her I told you so (along with having the problem actually fixed haha).",1647710431.0,26

They're literally just saying ""yeah, you're not that pretty but you're nice and that's what counts!"". It's true in a way, you're a good person and honestly that's better than being the most beautiful person in the world but have an ugly heart.  But you have to admit that society has a strangle hold on the idea of beauty and no matter how good you are sometimes you'll run into problems because you aren't conventionally attractive. At most people don't really care whether you're a good person or not, especially when it comes to modelling or other similar fields where you have to fit the conventional standard; hell, even dating. This goes all ways for both men, women and everything in between.

It just sucks because everyone is beautiful in a way, but you can't change a system on society that literally everyone sees on magazines and billboards and go ""yes, that is beauty,"" and runs with it. Yes, were taking steps to slowly overcome this, but honestly it should have been overcome years ago.",1647699225.0,101

What happened? She grew up, and realized how fucked up the world is. And how bad people can be. And that you can't always be nice, and go along with things. Cause that's how you get hurt. That's how you get manipulated. That's how you get used. You need to stand up for yourself. And not always go along with everything, and act like everything is okay.  

Sorry for the little rant there. But I used to be one of the sweetest people. Until I grew up. And realized I was being manipulated by my own dad, and his gf. I remembered going home to my own mom. And just crying. Crying and telling her all of the things that happened at my dad's. Things that made me uncomfortable and scared. Things that I didn't know were not okay until I was much older. I was always terrified of going to my dad's. And I always begged my mom to stay with her. But I had to go....

I eventually got therapy, and I'm doing so much better now. Im not as easy going anymore. And I actually stand up for myself. And say something when I'm not okay. Or if something makes me uncomfortable. I'm a lot older now. I'm old enough to decide how I want my relationships to go. And I don't go over to my dad's very often anymore.

I think another perspective you can have when those privileged people tell you these things is that they‚Äôre still not 100% happy, fulfilled, or successful, DESPITE having those things (beauty, wealth, etc.).‚Ä¶ and nor should they be. That‚Äôs probably what they actually meant. 

Somewhere in the world, there are probably people that grew up very rich that would rather work a middle-income job (while giving up their family wealth) than to chase wealth. Of course they know money is important, but they still shake their heads at people (that came from both rich and poor beginnings) that are obsessively chasing for more and more wealth for the wrong reasons. They already know that money doesn‚Äôt guarantee 100% happiness, fulfillment, a healthy psyche, because they grew up with it. You need money and financial stability, but I don‚Äôt think any individual needs THAT much of it, to the point where they‚Äôre eating off of crystal. That won‚Äôt make anyone happy, not really. No one *needs* that. They need food on the table, a decent roof over their heads, they need financial (and therefore mental) stability rather than a paycheck to paycheck situation, but they don‚Äôt need crystal plates. That‚Äôs probably the idea behind saying ‚Äúmoney isn‚Äôt important‚Äù. 

Same thing with pretty people. Yes they have an easier time scoring with the best looking people, but some of them have probably eventually realized that good looks aren‚Äôt the only requirement and that they want actual personality/substance behind the beauty. They‚Äôve probably been painfully rejected by people they really liked, *despite* always having good looks, and they have rejected and dumped others that are good-looking. There are good looking people that are completely unhappy and unfulfilled both when they‚Äôre single and when they‚Äôre in relationships. Yes looks makes things a hell of a lot easier, but they‚Äôre not the key to a happy relationship. 

So yes, they‚Äôre partially taking their privilege for granted by saying these things, but they‚Äôre also right and valid in their experience. They probably just worded their views badly.",1647716168.0,24

How many doctors and firefighters and other everyday heroes took on those roles because something bad happened? 

How many amazing treatments have been invented for horrible diseases? Would those have been invented if they only happened to bad people?

For that matter, life isn't split into ""good people"" and ""bad people"" everyone has done good things and bad things.

It's all about to the degree you grew up in a bubble. I went to a university known for having a huge population of extremely wealthy students, and some of them were perfectly normal, but many were exhausting to be around because they had absolutely no perspective on how the 99% live. If you grow up around people of all levels of wealth you're exposed at least a little to that, even if you don't share those struggles. But if you only interact with rich people many assume that everyone lives like that.

There‚Äôs a French town where Garfield-shaped phones have been washing up on the beach for decades, because a shipping crate full of the product accidentally got lost and stuck in a nearby rock formation, and the water just keeps gradually picking up the phones and washing them out to shore. There are so many that the town‚Äôs anti-littering/‚Äúkeep our beach clean‚Äù campaign includes Garfield iconography. 

Bill Murray only agreed to voice Garfield in the live-action films because he misread the scriptwriter‚Äôs name and thought it was an actual, famous person who wrote it. Murray hates the movie and did everything he could to try to fix the storyline while recording his audio. When shown the first completed cut of the movie, he said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúWhoever edited this should be fired.‚Äù The editor was in the same room at the time. The man walked out, and never edited another movie ever again. 

Lorenzo Music, the man who voiced Garfield in the original cartoons, also voiced Bill Murray‚Äôs character in the Ghostbusters cartoons. 

There‚Äôs an old Garfield strip that implies Garfield is friends with OJ Simpson. 

Lyman, Jon Arbuckle‚Äôs roommate, disappeared from the comics a long time ago without any mention. In an official Garfield book, there is some speculation about where he might be. One of the answers is, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look in Jon‚Äôs basement!‚Äù In Garfield‚Äôs Scary Scavenger Hunt, a game that was on the Garfield website, you explore a haunted house and actually do find Lyman chained up in a dungeon cell in the house‚Äôs basement.",1647700106.0,19

2974,AskReddit,What is a useless fact that you know?,,1647673361.0,3920,6065,0.96,707Cutthoatcommitee,"Just for some better clarification here. a black panther only refers to specifically a leopard or Jaguar that is melanistic (opposite of albino). They are not a separate species of cat nor is a panther. Panther is an umbrella term for three big cats in specific. 

A panther in general can refer to a leopard if it‚Äôs in the old world and if it‚Äôs in The United States it‚Äôs generally referring to Pumas and when in Latin America it‚Äôs usually referring to Jaguars. So basically a panther can be a puma, leopard or a Jaguar but a black panther can only be a Jaguar or leopard since melanistic pumas aren‚Äôt a documented thing. 

Almost done here but a Puma, Cougar and mountain lion are the same species of big cat just different names and the only one currently native to the United States. Jaguars have a current range as far north as south central Mexico and have a historical range that goes all the way north to Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico extending all the way east to the Louisiana/Texas border. So yes historically there were actual Jaguars roaming around  the deep southwest United States as well. Something wild though is there has been multiple sightings of a lone male? (Could be a female) Jaguar that is actually living in the mountains of Arizona. He has been recorded and is being kinda sorta tracked by fish and game the best they can and was seen as recently as 2019 I believe. They think he came from one of the populations from central Mexico and migrated really far north and decided to stay. After all it‚Äôs technically historical range for them so it makes sense that he can thrive there as well as in California or New Mexico.",1647707068.0,18

In the 90s I worked for Dominos and we had this garlic sauce called ‚ÄúZzesty‚Äù sauce that we had to apply to the pan pizzas that us lowlife teens called splooge. 

Well, my assistant manager Stacy liked to be cool like us kids so she started calling it that as well but she didn‚Äôt know what the slang word was actually for. 

Then one day our supervisor Brenda, who was just the right mix of hip enough to know what splooge meant but overly religious enough to be taken aback by its mention was there and Stacy asked me for some splooge. 

The horrified look on Brenda‚Äôs face, combined with the confused look on Stacy‚Äôs face at why Brenda was horrified  was the funniest thing I‚Äôd ever seen and thankfully I was able to stifle the explosion of laughter until I made my way back into the walk-in to get the splooge.",1647691590.0,132

I used to employ a young manager gal who had a raunchy sense of humor behind the professional facade for the customers.  At some point, *Man Chowder* became a member of our running gag repertoire.  That ended abruptly when she was ordering lunch one day, and instead of clam chowder actually ordered *man* chowder, then instantly looked mortified.  Both her and the person on the other end just played it off, but unlike the typical slow death of overwrought workplace jokes, nobody there ever uttered *man chowder* again after that.",1647678549.0,32

3703,AskReddit,What are the best nicknames you've heard of for semen?,,1647658949.0,2892,4937,0.88,ArmyOfDog,"Eddie Vedder said that the name Pearl Jam was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.

Nobody believes that. And the band eventually admitted that other then Eddie having a great-grandmother named Pearl, the rest was made up. 

Many people believe it means jizz. The band has never confirmed this explanation, instead offering questionable alternative explanations. 

One of them is that bassist Jeff Ament suggested Pearl, and then with them being big fans of Neil Young who‚Äôd recently played a show where every song was a 20 minute jam, they combined jam with Pearl, resulting in Pearl Jam. 

Originally, they were called Mookie Blaylock, naming themselves after a basketball player they liked. Ultimately, they named their debut album after him instead, as Mookie Blaylock‚Äôs number was ten.",1647662150.0,65

Sometimes bands with suggestive names seem to get by without having to explain their names away (AC/DC, The Butthole Surfers, Steely Dan, Bush, Flaming Lips, Whitesnake, Pussy Riot, Hole, *etc*.) Some other bands with daring names seem to back away from them when record companies balk. 

It has long been assumed that this meaning was also the meaning for [10cc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10cc#1972%E2%80%931976:_Original_line-up) and (arguably, and perhaps by way of Mississippi John Hurt) the same meaning for [The Lovin' Spoonful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovin'_Spoonful#Name).

There is a story about a sewing machine being the band name origin, and the band did use an electrical theme in their spark logo and in album titles like ""High Voltage."" 

Even so, fans in the 1970s knew there was a strong sexual connotation whether the band claimed it or not. It's hard to come off as innocent with song lyrics like theirs.",1647670488.0,9

It was this evil/trickster spirit that was basically half an (old?) man split down the middle. If he turned his cut side towards you he was invisible and he could leap great distances on his one leg. He would challenge young lone men to a fight, I think with promises of wealth if he could be beaten. Looking weak, many young men would be lured in only to be overpowered by the creature's monstrous strength. I think the creature possibly ate those they defeated.

EDIT: Having had a bit more of a dig into it I think it's part of a theme of one-armed, one-legged creatures in various African folklores. ""Hai-uri"" to the Khoekhoe, ""Chiruwi"" to some central African group (that's all it says online, no idea which peoples that would be) or ""Tikdoshe"" to the amaZulu. 

Not a lot of info out there of what a Tikdoshe does but references to the Chiruwi say it challenges those it meets to a deadly fight but if beaten will beg for its life and teach the person magic/medicine so that they can become a medicine man.",1647682361.0,28

It‚Äôs interesting, because while it‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúnature spirit‚Äù, it‚Äôs not benevolent, or at worst, mischievous, like nature spirits in mythology tend to be (putting aside the unseelie court, of course). It represents the dark aspects of nature: hunger, cold, predation, savagery.

It‚Äôs also interesting to me, because the story actually seems like it could be about prion diseases. The Wendigo spirit possesses people who eat the flesh of other people and it slowly drives them insane and turns them into vicious beasts. Sounds a lot like what Creutzfeldt-Jakob does, how it slowly destroys your brain leading to psychosis and rapid mental decline before death. It, of course, also spreads through eating the flesh (primarily brain and spinal fluid) of infected people. So to my mind, the Wendigo story was a way for them to explain people being infected with a prion disease, and as a warning to not eat human flesh so as not to become infected as well.",1647665859.0,1294

A couple people get killed, but they were basically all people who went over to the kid‚Äôs house. The Wendigo didn‚Äôt actually go out and do much of anything until like the last 20 minutes.

Wasn‚Äôt terrible, but the Wendigo is my favorite mythological creature, there really aren‚Äôt enough movies about the Wendigo out there, and I really, really wanted this one to be amazing.

You have a dungeon master (DM) who guides the experience. They set up dungeons, monsters, and plot and are basically a combination of a narrator, a guide for the players, and play as the NPCs and villains. Their goal isn't really to win or to lose, it's simply to give the other players a good time, so think of them more like an author than a game player.

Each person chooses their own character and decides their looks, personality, backstory, everything. They also have a list of basic abilities called skills where they have a certain number of points in each skill, like climbing.

Narrative play in D&D is generally telling the DM what you want to do, then the DM figures out what skill best suits that action, comes up with a number that you need to pass it, and then you roll the die and add the die to your points in that ability to see if you pass or fail. Combining the ability points with the die roll gives the best of both worlds - not random but not known, so someone experienced in a skill can still fail it but is less likely to.

Once the player has the results then the DM narrates what that pass or fail actually means. If they pass maybe they simply managed to climb the wall they were trying to, or maybe they climbed the wall so well that they got to the top twice as fast as everyone else. If they failed maybe they simply couldn't even get started, or maybe they climbed three quarters up, got distracted by a bird, and then fell so far that they broke their legs. It's all up to the DM to weave the player's results into a story.

Fighting in D&D is similar but more complicated. It's been a while since I played so I won't get into the details but you still combine die rolls with skills to figure out how much damage you do and take, but it is much more spelled out than the narrative play and works more like video games do, where players and enemies have HP.

Also, beyond simple skills there are feats and spells which are special abilities detailed in the guidebook. These can get pretty complex and are part of what gives D&D its reputation for being a game for nerds. For example, there is the spell Tensor's Floating Disk, whose first half of the description reads: ""This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.""",1647711252.0,5

I don't think you understand how the word 'probably' is used accurately, and whilst the idea of a giant having different proportions came to mind, I looked at the fingers and few other bones that seemed very human so I pointed the elbow out.

I wonder what it looks like. Anecdotally and from reading about this exact topic over the years, it's safe to assume kb/m has a higher skill ceiling. Aim is a large factor in FPS success, especially in hitscan FPS, and the mouse is a more versatile and ergonomic aiming tool than a controller. Would anyone want to edit movies or photos using a controller rather than a mouse? Kind of the same thing from my perspective.

That said, every device type excels at different things and it would be great if more games continued the trend of giving us the freedom to find combos that work for us individually. For example, keyboard and mouse isn't really great for the couch and I'm not lounging on my couch to git gud in an FPS.

5057,gaming,Patience is key,,1647696628.0,768,41299,0.93,towerdweller,"Modern (as in ""since the world wars) explosive devices use fairly stable explosives that can only really detonate with high heat/spark. When you release the lever in a grenade a short fuse lights, which lights a ""primer"" charge, which detonates the main explosive. So if you just drop a grenade or bang it around it shouldn't spontaneously explode. 

If you're near a grenade that explodes, it's not a big fireball, what hurts/kills you are all the tiny metal fragments flying through the air. These shouldn't cause other grenades to explode, but definitely work on humans.

Edit: as a couple of people have pointed out, there is also a concussive blast from grenades that can hurt/kill you if you're too close. To my main point, this is still not generally enough to set off any other grenades unless maybe they were really close. The pressure from the blast goes down really fast as you get further away from it, since it dissipates as a sphere.",1647705963.0,103

I know the German ""Stielhandgranate"" AKA ""Potato Masher"" could be triggered by an explosion if the pull cord that started the fuse got caught on debris. But even then they wouldn't ALL detonate. Maybe one or two might. And obviously if the pin in a MkI or MkII was pulled by debris or other accident as a result of a small grenade size explosion, it could go off. But there would be a delay, and again you could not get all the grenades to detonate this way. Pretty much the grenade will only go off it you pull the pin or otherwise trigger the fuse, but the grenades fuse is gonna be what causes the grenade to explode, and those fuses aren't instant. So if if throwing one grenade into a box of grenades made some of them go off, they would go off at different times.

The lack of intentional fragmentation gave it a shorter kill radius which meant that doctrine for the grenade's usage was to throw them and then assault to position after they detonate (sorta like a more lethal version of a flash bang) as it's more likely the enemy will be stunned than with fragmentation grenades. They used a substantial amount of explosive material in them which gave them more destructive power than a fragmentation grenade but generally a smaller kill radius due to how the force dispurses as it covers more volume. These grenades could also be bundled together to combine their blast enough to damage armored vehicles or defensive structures.

The MK2 grenade by contrast was designed to fragment and shower the area with bits of metal to kill/injure the enemy. The concussive blast was still quite lethal but the fragmentation was the primary casualty inflicting element of the grenade (close enough for the concussive blast to kill then you are also probably full of shrapnel).

Eventually, not being able to apply the great parts of the game to a structured story (Since most quests don't even require you to do anything with those) is what kills the fun for me.

IMHO, jc2 was the best in the series. 3 and 4 are good but something in 2 just made it feel good. I wanna believe it was partly the physics. 2 felt  a little cartoonish in physics but in 3 and 4 it feels like they went a more real direction. And it doesn't translate as well in an over the top game like just cause. Might be just me but the controls feel heavily laggy in 4. Like if you attach too many grapple hook points, one is bound to sling you forward even though you are just trying to stick a couple rockets to something. And tanks handle incredibly poorly. Can't run over even small barricades without it either getting stuck inside the tank or stopping the tank.

I do love how they made it feel more like it was a mercenaries game spinoff but the 4th one though. The missions did feel a bit bland but the world and destruction were fun. Overall, $100ish well spent (gold launch edition plus the story dlc)",1647709670.0,1

So the map is littered with the mini events like ""wingsuit challenge"" and ""car stunt"" stuff. Which is alright.

But there's no military bases to blow up. No other random collectibles (whether you love em or hate em). There's technically stuff to destroy, and kind of a point to it. But it's much much less organized than the previous games.

And that's what I liked about JC2 and 3. You had a more clear idea about where to go and what to do. You're meant to go to those bases and blow things up there until it's ""complete"".

In JC4 there's just a few things here and there to destroy in places where main missions occur. But it's not really tracked - and in fact anything you destroy will just respawn next time you load in.

Then some areas have the start of the main goal missions which is to take down some weather control machine. They are interesting but there isn't many. Like one mission is to shut down antennas that control lightning that can just about kill you if you aren't quick enough.

I bought the second one and it was so good an improvement in every single way- the tombs were improved, the story was great (Lara's actor conveys so much emotion through her voice), and the overall gameplay was fleshed out (the stealth takedowns are a guilty pleasure of mine- so gory and the vibrations on a controller are sublime). I loved it so much I played through it a second time immediately after. once shadow goes on sale, I buy it immediately. i saw that it was in a jungle, central american setting and was enamoured immediately. the first part of the game isn't too bad (i really liked the fact that you could change the difficulties separately and the immersive voiceover was fun too). i get to the lost city part, and it's so... the puzzles are unintuitive, the game glitched a billion times, and the new systems hindered rather than helped. especially the skills system- why on earth does it not show you the skills you can unlock through the story/challenge tombs??? at that point i was already thinking about replaying spiderman so i just did that instead. i haven't had time to go back to it and I'm not sure I want to.

He's been a lap kitty these last few years, ever since the other cat passed, and now he kisses me all the time. Just extremely affectionate, and will paw at me for attention or lay against me any time I'm sleeping.

He was diagnosed with lymphoma a couple months back, and we're treating him with steroids right now.

When you give item you bought that item with your own money but if you had just given the money they could have use it to bulk buy and buy the same thing but more

If you give an item you most likely will give the obvious item and if everybody does that a charity can end up with to much of the obvious item (potentially having to throw away some) and not enough of the less obvious item 

Money is also easier to transport allowing the charity to buy stuff near where they are need. That has the double benefit or stimulating local economy which is a good thing when you are trying to help zone in crisis

I know that giving stuff you bought feels better because it feels like you gave money and effort but the best thing you can do is give just money. Its literally the best of both world, you can be lazy and do more good than if you had made an effort",1647704998.0,51

My little man is the opposite.  He‚Äôs a really good boy, but he gets affection in his own time.  He wants you to acknowledge him and let him know you love him, and then he wants to fall asleep on your clean clothes or on the clean towels in the linen closet until it‚Äôs time to eat.

We can look back and judge with our new understanding of equality but I am not sure it helps. For me, I look at it as a metric for just how far we have come in my lifetime.

Since then I had one dream he was in it was a week or two after he passed. I was going to a big church with a little parish hall, dinning area and kitchen, and as I was walking into the church I saw him running towards me.

My current three dogs‚Ä¶ one of them has such wanderlust it‚Äôs insane, he made it all the way to the grocery store as a puppy and jumped in an old ladies car when he wanted to come home.

But on first approach to the male owner his reaction was slow, terrified, and submissive, implying in the past bad things happened when he had this experience.

Again, that doesn't mean that this human was abusive to this dog, but it means someone taught this animal that coming to someone can be a frightening experience that should be met with total submission.

On her own, Sharon has said some real shitty things, largely owing to being a fussy old British boomer. Spouting points of view that have shades of racism, classism and ableism while routinely forgetting her points of privilege, aka, being the manager and wife of one of the most famous musicians of all time.  


Aside from that, she has been the business side of Ozzy's career ever since he left Black Sabbath, and her dad was Black Sabbath's manager. While she has undoubtedly been the force in Ozzy's life that has kept him alive all these years, she is also THE sole decision maker for all of Ozzy's creative endeavors. In the 00's, Ozzy's past band members complained they weren't being compensated fairly for music royalties, so Sharon had their parts re-recorded and then changed the mastering levels of his back catalog when re-released on CD's so she could go into court and say ""see we took your performances out and no one ever noticed you weren't the ones playing the instruments, you don't deserve more money."" Eventually in the 2010's the original recordings got re-released and remastered.   


Being Ozzy's business side also means she's the reason for Ozzfest and how that was run over the years, The Osbournes reality show, The reality show where bands competed to get on the Ozzfest ticket,  every commercial he's ever been in, and every endorsement he does, including their joint shilling for NFT's right now.",1647716641.0,3

Asking god for strength not to kill himself by the end of the day.

Something about the beat and melancholy pushed me to find it. I later translated it via DeepL because im Danish, the lyrics are amazing. So is the song. 

No one needs war


At ease until the dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us, echoing loudly


No one wants war


Let's burn till dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us with a loud echo


There's no prettier color


The color


Of light without war


The color of summer


The clouds have taken the planet


On guard, my heavens


Boy-boy-boy


Painted with color on the banner


In stripes as red as blood


Yellow as the sun above us


My green Zion


My Rastafari


No one wants war


At ease till the dawn




War in ashes of order


Sing to us, with a loud echo of it


No one wants war


Let's burn till dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us with a loud echo


Oh, we should have been smart sooner


Many brothers would have survived


If only the stars hadn't carried us through the night


‚ô™ From the rocking in the night, in the beginning ‚ô™


‚ô™ We'll make a record ‚ô™


‚ô™ So that we can be happy ‚ô™


‚ô™ On a familiar path ‚ô™


‚ô™ From bad weather ‚ô™


‚ô™ I'm in time for the steam train ‚ô™


 Here's a hello to you


Take me secretly


Away from the war.


No one needs war


We'll be free before the dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us, echoing loudly


No one needs war


Let's burn till dawn


War in the ashes of the order


Sing it to us with a loud echo",1647634414.0,15

> In 2018, Prusikin quoted the famous aphorism: ""The [Russian] state has murdered my Motherland"" and criticised the Russian populace's easygoing attitude towards life and, especially, local indifference towards corruption. In a 2019 interview with Xenia Sobchak, Prusikin spoke of his total dislike of modern Russian politics, emphasising the increased ""cult of intolerance and anger"" in internal politics after 2012.

During the first couple days of the invasion I started looking to Ukraine, it‚Äôs history, and modern culture since I realized that while I felt horrible and disgusted by what was happening, I knew next to nothing of their history. 

Found a guy called Yarmak (at least that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs translated to in everything I‚Äôve seen) who had some sick beats going, and a great sounding flow. Started listening to his stuff with a translation pulled up beside, and some of it is extremely powerful, and related in ways to current events.

For example his song ‚Äú22‚Äù is about the events there in 2014, and contains a section that goes (translated to English): 

‚ÄúIt shouldn't be like this, guys.
I'm bandaging my country
with white gauze.
There are the ones,
whose souls are not empty yet around me.
Those, who are ready to sacrifice
their bodies for the truth.
She was lying torn, like a ruin.
People around were whispering her name -
Ukraine.
 
Refrain:
My country will never kneel.
And our cities will make a stand
like mountains, believe me.
There's no one who'll prevent us
from getting drunk of freedom.
While in each of us
the soul of a Ukrainian is living.‚Äù

Seriously I highly recommend looking him up (or if you check my post history I posted one of his videos recently) because it‚Äôs some really good stuff. Even before you translate I promise you‚Äôll be bobbing your head to some of his beats.",1647616767.0,13

If you feel like taking a litte feedback, there's just one thing that could be done better: matching the perspectives of the car and ground. In short, if you would put the car on the ground and take a photo from the same angle & height, the ground would extend further towards the horizon than the platform you are using in the studio. This means that in your final photo, the ground ends ""too early"" leaving an artificial look. You could fix that by either lowering the camera (imagine taking a photo from ground plane, then the horizon is barely visible), extending the platform longer behind the car or simply use some PS magic to do it.

Hope this make sense :)

Anyway, awesome job!",1647710447.0,2

This is a typical lower middle class upgrade or starter home. When built, this is a big house outside North America.
It's a step up for the generation it was built for.  That second story & garage represents the advantages of simply being white Al Bundy in America after WW2:  lots of resources, high demand, reduced competition and sophisticated infrastructure & education systems which are able to grow with demand... thanks to collecting and spending taxes.    This further fuels a hungry economy, widening it's effects among the public & increasing incomes - making a bigger down payment and a bigger mortgage payment for a bigger house possible for millions more people.   Al Bundy has no skills.  Just like the owners of the shoe companies, Al didn't build the road, grow the wilderness,  develop Conservation techniques in a State College, or get a GI bill loan.  But he benefited from all of it with cheaper, faster housing,  enjoying a higher quality of life than the people who did build it.

They are currently collecting signatures for repealing it.

To put into perspective their greed... If the kid who inherits the house doesn't want to live in it, the taxable base resets to market value at the time of inheritance. For many of those this means resetting from $100-300 range to $1-3 million range; i.e. about 10x increase in property tax. This actually isn't nearly as bad as it sounds for investment/income property:

* Properties in CA appreciate in value about 5% annually. Property tax is about 1% of taxable base. Taxable base can not increase more than 2% annually until property changes hands. So it only gets better and better over time as far as heir's net worth goes.
* Annual property tax is a small fraction of annual rent the property can generate, even with taxable base at current market value of the property. And it only gets better for the landowner as years go by. Because property tax can not increase by more than 2%, but rents are increasing by far more.
* Landowners get to write off taxes as business expense.
* Landowners get to claim ""depreciation"" on rental properties (seriously? ""depreciation""? on something that *increases* in value 5% annually!?).

So.. Nope... The state isn't taxing out of those properties those ""poor"" heirs who just got ownership of investment/income properties basically for free. Those ""poor"" heirs in reality just inherited a huge wealth that keeps increasing in value and generates income that *far exceeds* property taxes, even if they are reset to market value at time of inheritance.

Meanwhile, the rest of us ends up being priced out of the market. No small wonder home ownership has been steadily declining in California.

Frankly, any kind of investment, income, or otherwise commercial property should be excluded from Prop 13. Ideally, the entire Prop 13 should be repealed and at the same time taxable base divorced from current market value of property.

Oh, and prevent landowners from claiming ""depreciation"" on things that *gain* in value year after year.",1647720801.0,1

My wife (who's European) and I took a trip there since my parents were about to sell the old house.  She'd, of course, heard the jokes, but never seen it firsthand.

On our way from the airport to the house, we stopped at a 7/11 along the side of a small highway to get some beer and wine.  As soon as we parked, a van pulled up next to us in the parking lot.  A very skinny man in an oversized shirt and overweight woman with midriff showing came out.  I'm not body shaming, just painting the picture.  I went in the store, she stayed in the car.

When I came out, five minutes later, the couple had already set up lawn chairs in the parking lot, she was huffing a cig while reading a magazine, and he a beer.  They did not, nor did they have any intention of, going in the store.

Now, mind you, the beach, along with dirt parking, was *just across the street.*  Not even a main beach, one where you'd be the only one for miles.  But this couple had decided to set up camp in *the 7/11 parking lot* instead.  This was 30 minutes into our trip.

I've learned that there are no basic regulations or enforcement on rules that we would consider basic for-safety laws anywhere else.   

No bumper or missing windows on your car?  no problem, we don't do inspections down here.   

Leave garbage and building materials thrown across your yard for months?  no problem, we don't like restrictive HOA's down here.   

Drive around town, in circles, for hours, with vision-restricting massive flags in tow, spouting your political views for all the folks enjoying their dinners to see.  Sure, that fits the do whatever your want vibe.

Industrial sewage spills and dangerous phosphate leaks into the waterways....multiple times.  Yes, no regulations on safety maintenance needed!  But we will fix it up after a problem happens.

The police presence is usually very visible, but after years of driving here, I have yet to see anyone pulled over for a traffic violation other than speeding.  Turn signals, stopping at red lights, following posted signs are all optional as part of the do whatever you want state.",1647696935.0,16

He named media proprietor Oprah Winfrey as his ideal running mate and said he would instantly marry his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, to make her First Lady.

a) not as many of them did as when Trump lost,  

b) it didn't last as long as when Trump lost,  

c) Hillary still won the popular vote even when she lost, so at least it was a little more reasonable to claim, meanwhile Trump lost to Biden by 7 million votes meaning he would need to discover a monumental amount of fraud to even have a fart in the wind's chance to overturn the election,   

d) Hillary actually *conceded,* and Trump blatantly lied to the American people, there's proof of it, yet people *still* want him president,  

e) People *stormed the Capitol* when Trump lost.  

f) There were Trump supporters in 2016 crying about election fraud *even when he won,* because they thought he should have beat Hillary by a wider margin.

I had to have reconstructive surgery and now have an implant. I have to look up and down using my head, not my eyes. As soon as I start rolling my eyes up or down instead of using my neck and head, I get double vision.

I lost my insurance a week before he assaulted me so I also wound up having to declare bankruptcy. Worked really hard to recover from that and was finally hitting breathing room and Covid came along.

Finding the sweet spot on my progressive lens is difficult. I've not seen a normal single moon in ten years now.

I am sorry you went through this and hope you are doing better now.

They're our family, friends and coworkers, people we'd never guess, and people we suspect immediately. It's a good thing to pry sometimes if you care.

 As I get older I'm realizing the family, while obviously positive in many ways, can also be one of the most pernicious structures we have. No organizations hide and cover up abuse more than families do, no one is more likely to abuse you than a family member. No structure is so quick to turn away outside eyes, or be so righteously indignant over suspicions, warranted or not. I come from an abusive household, my childhood involved watching my mother being beaten, in between my own beatings, and no one ever stopped it. 

We are in a weird place where most people seem to consider the family a unit separate from society, with their own rules and punishments, unregulated  by the general population, and immune from any curtailing without involving ineffectual bureaucracy. Add to this laws changing to give family more authority, and it seems to me a broader, more malignant plan for societal domination, where an authoritarian man is tasked with keeping his Cadre in line and in submission to authority. I think the nuclear family is a detriment to humanity, maybe that belongs in r/unpopularopinion, but I stand by it.",1647712333.0,2

The weirdest was another pro bono case, where it came to light the ‚Äúabuser‚Äù was the victim. They didn‚Äôt ever harm the victim and instead had spent years under emotional and physical abuse.

I thought of myself as very weak when thinking about the memories in which I was shaking physically. The association I had with shaking people is not one of strenght.  
Until I met a physical trauma therapist that told me the shaking was actually my body releasing the enormous load of stress I was holding inside and that it's a way of the body to return to balance. Animals do it too.  
That really reframed the way I think about myself when remembering those instances. Instead of feeling like someone with a weak body, I now know how strong and wise my body was and that it had my best interest at heart instead of abandoning me. The situation was just so extreme that so much stress needed to be released and that's why the shaking could be so violently or long-winded.",1647716229.0,16

Your comment is way too similar to the ""all lives matter"" response to the ""black lives matter"" protests. Sure, ""all daughters matter"" but, using your own argument, so do all sons and everyone else who is abused. Using your own argument, why aren't you talking about ""your group of"" gals who abuse men (or who abuse women). Let's list out all people in all comments just to make sure that nobody is being left out because you incorrectly perceive who this person cares about. It's a bit absurd.

Take the spirit of the original comment, not the letter. I'm sure if you asked them, they're not going to reply to you that they don't care about other women who get abused and that they only care about their daughter and nobody else. If this is how they chose to express their support against domestic violence then the proper thing to do is to encourage them, not scold them just because you think they left something out.

If your comment is to be taken seriously then the only lesson to the person who wrote the original is to not speak up because anything they say - no matter how supportive - will be used against them because they didn't include one group or another or some other trivial criticism.

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

Fantastic. Neither is a male, therefore ""husband"" is inappropriate.

The downvotes are most like from people like me who think that you can't just make up different definitions of words just to align with your own incorrect world view; and, ultimately, just because they use that word (while it is their choice) doesn't make it correct - it just makes them sound stupid.

8645,pics,[OC] This is the face of domestic abuse. This is my face.,,1647678483.0,301,3709,0.9,Organic__Chemistry,"Let's take a look at just raw numbers. The entire United States military (including clerks, nurses, generals, cooks, etc) is 1.2 million. Law enforcement is estimated at about 1.1 million (again, including clerks and other non-officers.) This gives us a combined force of 2.3 million people who could potentially be tapped to deal with a civil insurrection. Keep in mind this also includes officers who serve in the prisons, schools, and other public safety positions that require their presence. That total of soldiers is also including US soldiers deployed to the dozens of overseas US bases in places like South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc. Many of those forces are considered vital and can't be removed due to strategic concerns.

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the state slaps a rifle in every filing clerk's hand and tells them to sort the situation out.

We now have to contend with the fact that many law enforcement and military personnel consider themselves patriots and wouldn't necessarily just automatically side with the state if something were to happen. There is a very broad swath of people involved in these communities that have crossover with militia groups and other bodies that are, at best, not 100% in support of the government. Exact numbers are hard to pin down but suffice it to say that not everybody would be willing to snap-to if an insurrection kicked off. Even if they didn't outright switch sides there's the very real possibility that they could, in direct or indirect ways, work against their employer's prosecution of the counter-insurgency either by directly sabotaging operations or just not putting as much effort into their work and turning a blind eye to things.

But, again, for the sake of argument, let's assume that you've somehow managed to talk every single member of the military and law enforcement services into being 100% committed to rooting out the rebel scum.

There are an estimated 400 million firearms in the US. Even if we just ignore 300 million firearms available as maybe they're antiques or not in a condition to be used, that's still 100 million firearms that citizens can pick up and use. Let's go even further than that and say of that 100, there are only about 20 million firearms that are both desirable and useful in an insurgency context and not say .22's or double barrelled shotguns.

It should be noted just for the sake of interest that several million AR-15's are manufactured every year and have been since 2004 when the ""assault weapons"" ban ended. Soooo 2-5 million per year for 15 years....

If only 2% of the US population decided ""Fuck it, let's dance!"" and rose up, that's about 6.5 million people. You're already outnumbering all law enforcement and the military almost 3 to 1. And you have enough weapons to arm them almost four times over. There are millions of tons of ammunition held in private hands and the materials to make ammunition are readily available online even before you start talking about reloading through scrounging.

So you have a well equipped armed force that outnumbers the standing military and law enforcement capabilities of the country by a significant margin.

""But the military has tanks, planes, and satellites!""

That they do however it's worth noting that the majority of the capabilities of our armed forces are centered around engaging another state in a war. That means another entity that also has tanks, planes, and satellites. That is where the majority of our warfighting capabilities are centered because that's what conflict has consisted of for most of the 20th century.

We've learned a lot about asymmetric warfare since our time in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of the key takeaways has been just having tanks and battleships is not enough to win against even a much smaller and more poorly armed opponent.

A battleship or a bomber is great if you're going after targets that you don't particularly care about but they don't do you a whole hell of a lot of good when your targets are in an urban setting mixed in with people that you, the commander, are accountable to.

Flattening a city block is fine in Overthereastan because you can shrug and call the sixty civilians you killed ""collateral damage"" and no one gives a shit. If you do that here, you seriously damage perceptions about you among the civilians who then are going to get upset with you. Maybe they manage to bring enough political pressure on you to get you ousted, maybe they start helping the rebels, or maybe they pick up guns of their own and join in. You killed fifteen fighters in that strike but in so doing you may have created thirty more.

Even drones are of mixed utility in that circumstance. It's also worth noting that the US is several orders of magnitude larger than the areas that drones have typically operated in during conflict in the Middle East. And lest we forget, these drones are not exactly immune from attacks. There's also not a lot a drone can do in places with large amounts of tree cover...like over a billion acres of the US.

And then even if we decide that it's worth employing things like Hellfire missiles and cluster bombs, it should be noted that a strategy of ""bomb the shit out of them"" didn't work in over a decade in the Middle East. Most of the insurgent networks in the region that were there when the war started are still there and still operating, even if their influence is diminished they are still able to strike targets.

Just being able to bomb the shit out of someone doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to win in a conflict against them.

Information warfare capabilities also don't guarantee success. There are always workarounds and methods that are resistant to interception and don't require a high level of technical sophistication. Many commercial solutions can readily be used or modified to put a communications infrastructure in place that is beyond the reach of law enforcement or the military to have reliable access to. Again, there are dozens of non-state armed groups that are proving this on a daily basis.

You also have to keep in mind the psychological factor. Most soldiers are ok with operating in foreign countries where they can justify being aggressive towards the local population; they're over here, my people are back home. It's a lot harder to digest rolling down the streets of cities in your own country and pointing guns at people you may even know.

What do you do as a police officer or soldier when you read that soldiers opened fire into a crowd of people in your home town and killed 15? What do you do when you've been ordered to break down the door of a neighbor that you've known your whole life and arrest them or search their home? What do you do if you find out a member of your own family has been working with the insurgency and you have a professional responsibility to turn them in even knowing they face, at best, a long prison sentence and at worst potential execution? What do you do when your friends, family, and community start shunning you as a symbol of a system that they're starting to see more and more as oppressive and unjust?

""People couldn't organize on that scale!""

This is generally true. Even with the networked communications technologies that we have it's likely ideological and methodological differences would prevent a mass army of a million or more from acting in concert.

In many ways, that's part of what would make an insurrection difficult to deal with. Atomized groups of people, some as small as five or six, would be a nightmare to deal with because you have to take each group of fighters on its own. A large network can be brought down by attacking its control nodes, communication channels, and key figures.

Hundreds of small groups made up of five to twenty people all acting on their own initiative with different goals, values, and methods of operation is a completely different scenario and a logistical nightmare. It's a game of whack-a-mole with ten thousand holes and one hammer. Lack of coordination means even if you manage to destroy, infiltrate, or otherwise compromise one group you have at best removed a dozen fighters from the map. Attacks would be random and spontaneous, giving you little to no warning and no ability to effectively preempt an attack.

Negotiation isn't really an option either. Deals you cut with one group won't necessarily be honored by another and while you can leverage and create rivalries between the groups to a certain extent you can only do this by acknowledging some level of control and legitimacy that they possess. You have to give them some kind of legitimacy if you want to talk to them, the very act of talking says ""You are worth talking to."" And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of these groups.

You are, in effect, trying to herd cats who not only have no interest in listening to you but are actively dedicated to frustrating your efforts and who greatly outnumber you in an environment that prevents the use of the tools that your resources are optimized to employ.

Would it be bad? Definitely. Casualties would be extremely high on all sides. That's not a scenario I would ever want to see play out.

They were designed to also be used after the war, part of the reason they were nearly impossible to destroy.

I believe the Brit‚Äôs, French, and US all tried to blast them down as part of the denzification of Germany after the war, but some, including the one in Berlin were so problematic and tough, they were causing more problems to surrounding infrastructure destroying them (train tracks near the one I was at, IIRC)

Basically they said fuck it. Everything else but these.

The one in Berlin has tours around and in it and is part of a park whose hills were constructed using rubble from the destruction on the town.

They also have rock climbing of the side of it.

I did like 4 walking tours with these folks if your interested to know more.

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can.

His legislative agenda is fucked because Sinema and Manchin are horrible people, but his administrative agenda is rolling right along. 

He's been reuniting the families separated by Trump's border policies, he's putting *extremely* qualified people in charge of federal agencies (many of which were vastly understaffed during Trump's term, intentionally so), and he's been getting regulations in place to help workers, for example by sharply curtailing non-compete clauses in employee contracts.

And of course, he implemented a vaccine rollout so smooth and automatic that we all just take it for granted now. We're vaccinating more people than we do for the flu, and it's *free*. So is testing, for the most part.

Sure, there are things I'd still like to see Biden do, and there are changes I wish he'd make (like treating the GOP as the fascists they've become instead of uselessly appealing to ""bipartisanship""), but the myth that he hasn't accomplished anything as President needs to die.",1647680576.0,13

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

This is not true... Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

I'll just paste a couple comments I read that explains it:

This is a false / disproven notion by historians, and a bit of history which was deliberate propaganda on part of the inter-war and eventually Nazi government. Part of the reason we had so much issue until recently is much of these documents of the old Imperial German government were held in Prussia, which was annexed by the Soviet Union after WW2-- so we really only started to get in depth documents proving us right in the 90s. 
An accessible book to serve as an introduction to this is ""The Great War: Myth & Memory"" by Dr. Dan Todman, ""The Myth of Reparations"" by Dr. Sally Marks (easily one of the most influential historians on inter-war Europe) if you want a more involved piece, and the principle paper on the matter imo, ""Clio Deceived: Patrotic Self-Censorship in Germany after the Great War"" by Dr. Holger Herwig, who's the leading living historian on early 20th Century Germany. 



The TL;DR is: Germany was capable of paying back every last cent of reparations, and between '18-'23, deliberately sabotaged their own economy to undermine French reconstruction & get reparations reduced. From '23 to '29, after putting in a competent Reichsbank Commissioner who wasn't purposefully sacking their economy, they had a meteoric financial recovery, and even then more than half of the reparations forgiven by the Entente. Remnants of the Imperial government in Weimar hid & destroyed evidence of this and spent millions of marks on a propaganda campaign within England to paint Germans as the victims of oppressive French revanchism.

---------------------------

> Germany was capable of paying back every last cent of reparations



To add to this, they had substantial help from America and American banks/banking system as well. Both the Dawes and Young plan (look em up kids) gave Germany more than enough assistance to help. Dawes pumped hundreds of millions into the German economy, with the idea that the product of this investment would pay off the investors and then the reparation's. While the Young plan forgave 20% or so of the total right off the bat and established very favourable repayment terms. Terms that eventually didn't matter cause Germany defaulted a couple years later and all the reparation's were forgiven anyways.



During the reparation period, Germany probably received more in foreign government investment and assistance (bonds and the like) than it paid in reparations. It's usually estimated 20-30 billion paid, 30-50 billion received. Germany made money on the reparations.



Don't get me wrong. Germany was economically bankrupted *following WW1 (twice actually, hyperinflation of 23, and the Great Depression). 


But the reparations played no part in that. It was German propaganda then, and it still is now.

b) the rest of the world isn't recovering a world war that lead to appeasement as a means of stalling

c) Russia does not have the means to re-militarize at the rate Germany did. 

d) at the time the world was moving from basic rifles to machines guns and horses to tanks and biplanes to modern design wings. There is no great leap in technology that will put Russia ahead of the curve like Germany in WWII. 

e) The US and dozen other countries are way ahead of Russia. 

f) Russia is not Germany in this scenario, they are the Ottoman empire

g) Germany had alliances with major players like Russia (or at least non aggression) and Japan- China would have to come out and form an Axis with Russia for that to play out.

I'm sure I could find a dozen other reasons why this is just flat out wrong.

We asked the exact same thing, why hadn't Russia and the Republics that made the USSR not joined NATO right away and he told us that nobody had ever realistically expected them to smoothly transition into working democracies.

He said the Soviet Union had devolved into a dictatorship and then into an authoritarian regime led by a junta led by a strong leader in Krushev and Brezhnev, a trend that had continued until its collapse.

He said Russians had been culturally been accustomed to having a strong, autoritharian leader dating back to the Czars, and it was too much to expect them to move to a democratic society that fast.   People were used to being told what to do and where at a weird crossroads as to what to do.

When Putin consolidated his power and began to rule like the leaders before him, the Russian people probably felt a sense of relief as he represented something familiar.

Why? Because the Clintons ended 12 years of republican control of the White House, but at nearly the same time the House went Republican for the first time since Eisenhower.

By the mid 90s the republicans obviously saw the writing on the wall. Reagan was very popular for a while but he sank in popularity as his health started to fail and his involvement in a number of high profile scandals like Iran Contra became evident. Bush was never particularly popular. Clinton was shaping up to be a very popular president and they miraculously had that one lever of power to pull - in the house.

The GOP of the 90s was already working in desperation mode. Newt Gingrich was the ‚Äúmastermind‚Äù of the modern GOP. Petty, even more hypocritical than ever, openly mean spirited and partisan. He used every tool at his disposal to chip away at the popularity of the Clintons and hamstring them. The Clintons wanted to do some good stuff like public healthcare and that played a big part in the GOP strategy, too.

The republican base ate this stuff up. This was also when talk radio was probably at it‚Äôs peak so they had started to perfect their synchronized messaging and around the clock brainwashing shit. Then Fox News launched and played by the exact same playbook with a facade of ‚Äúnews‚Äù.

Republican voters are literally brainwashed to hate Clinton and it stuck, they‚Äôre still brainwashed 30 years later.

I'm not an American but was educated in America and live in America part time. I was taught that the purpose of education was to develop the confidence and humility to question, query, challenge and listen.

Many Americans are not convinced that what the media, politicians and consensus of their neighbors espouse or believe is correct. Why is that wrong? To me it seems like an exercise in critical thinking, a desire to collect large amounts of varied data and independently consider what is being put forth.

The ""They,"" you refer to...they are not children. 

Your oppositional defiance disorder trope is flat because that is a condition of hierarchical subordination in parent/child, primary/secondary, authority/governed relationships.

It is not contrarian to challenge presumed facts. It is not contrarian to demand validation. It is not contrarian to pressure leadership to be transparent and forthcoming. It is not contrarian to be interested in the truth, EVEN IF the truth affects one's relationship to a party, a person, a perspective. 

Some people are very happy being guided and prescribed and being told what they are to believe. They do not have any desire for investigation, dissection, assessment. They do not have capacity. But some other ARE interested in these things and to chalk everyone up to contrarian and write them off as defiant and resistant for the sake of resisting is not only wrong, but it is dangerous and it is prejudicial. And one day, some government, at some time, will decide to enact or mandate or affirm some position or some law that affects YOU directly. And it is the They you speak of who will be standing WITH you in defense of your liberty, defense of your free thought, defense of your intuition, defense of your concept of what is right for you. 

You may like the world you are creating today, where people are subordinate and/or are expected to follow along happily without challenge -- but one day you will not.

America and the very concept of democracy rest on the idea that we can discuss, debate, challenge and demand more from each other and from government. Release this tenet at your own peril, in your personal life. But do not suggest that **I must lose it, or that America losing it can ever bring about anything but tyrany of conscience.",1647717514.0,0

Here in the UK it's easier for them, powerful russian interests just openly pay for access to our top politicians and there is no will in the political class to do anything to either change this or bring to book those who have taken such payments (including our Prime Minister).

To be fair, the British and Americans have been doing the same in Africa, the middle East, Eurasia, Southeast Asia and South America for decades.  The current war has initiated what I call a swing period where our enemies become our partners and our rivals become our enemies in a 1984 style reversal of geopolitical stance.

The last time I saw that happen in the UK was when Tony Blair announced that Libya were coming in from the cold and committed to world peace and non-proliferation, right before we started buying their oil again.

I watched the western media switch from certain optimism for Hilary shift to realizing their doom as Trump won and continued until all the feeds died ~2AM, at which point I switched to foreign feeds like RT and Al Jazeera and watched Putin give his congrats speech live at 4AM. That speech told me everything I already knew... his congrats were short and sweet, and then he jumped immediately into dictating foreign policy in Syria with no pause, as if the event were not just planned, but the outcomes of the win were also already settled.

>Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented.[1] Propaganda can be found in news and journalism, government, advertising, entertainment, education, and activism[2] and is often associated with material which is prepared by governments as part of war efforts, political campaigns, health campaigns, revolutionaries, big businesses, ultra-religious organizations, the media, and certain individuals such as soapboxers.

>In the 20th century, the English term propaganda was often associated with a manipulative approach, but historically, propaganda has been a neutral descriptive term of any material that promotes certain opinions or ideologies.[1][3]

Similarly, most of us now saying, ‚ÄúBut why don‚Äôt we treat the Syrian refugees as well as the Ukrainian refugees‚Äù are just directly or indirectly parroting subtle, moderate Russian propaganda streams. 

Those are reasonable ideas. We could have thought those thoughts ourselves. But the reason we suddenly are saying those things all at once, and feel as if we‚Äôve always said those things, is that Putin‚Äôs people did a great job of using fairly reasonable ideas to herd us where they want us to go. 

The whiny ‚Äúwhy are they mean to us poor Russians‚Äù theme is probably an example of the dumb propaganda stream, but a lot of the over-the-top anti-Russian stuff could easily be part of a more subtle propaganda stream. 

When we deny that we‚Äôre vulnerable to being affected by subtle or left-leaning propaganda, then we help Putin‚Äôs people tighten the noose around our own necks.",1647718434.0,2

The current sanctions are very limited and only targeted at certain oligarchs, companies, and banks. Many Russian banks are still connected to SWIFT.

There is a misconception that the current sanctions are stronger than they actually are because many well-known consumer brands pulled out of Russia by their own decision. But many other Western companies are still operating in Russia.

Poland is absolutely right. Ban all trade with Russia.

However the West should do something about rising wheat prices that will impact the global poor. Ukraine and Russia produces 25% of the wheat in the world. North America and Europe should lift all restrictions on wheat farming and production and flood the global market to counteract the price shock from the lack of Ukrainian and Russian wheat.",1647692864.0,409

1) if we don't intervene Russia will continue. Itl probably take a few years to quell the insurrections and begin assimilating Ukrainian military assets, but they will continue.

I hate this debate because it gets so out of control and spiraling with ideological fanaticism way too fast, but long story short, after Fukushima, Germany did a reevaluation of most of its nuclear plants and found glaring security holes in a lot of them, with others being soon to deteriorate. As a result, and in accordance with public opinion at the time, Germany decided to not reinvest money to fix those power plants and instead decided to deprecate its nuclear energy generation when their security certificates run out.

Germany did not ramp up its gas energy production as a result. It delayed its exit from coal, and at the time funded the SolarWorld-Bubble, but gas has always been very benign to pure power generation. Gas in Germany is mainly used for heating (and cooking), which has nothing to do with its grid power.

Even now, 10 years after stopping to invest in nuclear, Germany is still generating more power via nuclear plants than via gas plants because [Gas is that irrelevant in grid production.](https://strom-report.de/medien/strommix-2020-stromerzeugung-deutschland-1-615x459.jpg)

Germany always had a major opposition against nuclear power. Every study for atomic repositories was heavily contested, every transport of nuclear waste was followed by large protests and even attempts of sabotage by disabiling the railway on which the transport relied. I read a famous childrensbook against nuclear energy in school (""Die Wolke/The Cloud""), and most germans have either read the book aswell or have seen the very popular film adaptation of it. You could see ""Nuclear energy, no thank you"" stickers everywhere.

I too am staunchly against nuclear power. If you build Nuclear plants, one day one will blow up, nothing is 100% safe, and if you do it in the middle of europe, you are in danger of contaminating densly populated areas for potentially decades. Here is what i wrote in another comment about it:

""And it's not a hypothetical scenario either. I've looked into it a bit a year ago. Do you know, why Fukushima went critical? There were major architectural and engineering flaws, like badly build sensors (they showed reducing pressure even though the pressure was increasing) or batteries in the cellar (that got flooded) , but also the crew forgot to open a valve to the emergency condenser unit, a system that works without energy by cooling the steam and thus reduces pressure. It was human failure. That can happen everywhere, no matter how theoretical save a reactor is, people make mistakes under stress and it showed in Japan 2010. If you build nuclear reactors, one day one is gonna explode.

And while I'm at Fukushima: Japan got lucky that the wind turned on day 3 or 4 towards the open sea, otherwise Tokio would have had to be evacuated. How do you evacuate 40 million people, that's right, you don't. Panic would have ensued. A nightmare.People always point to Fukushima and say, look, nothing really bad happened even in this unique scenario, forgetting how LUCKY people were.""

This is how democracies work. The population wanted to get rid of nuclear power (not because of panic) and our leaders had to listen, even more so after fukushima. Our mistake wasnt that we got rid of a dangerous technology, but that we didnt heavily invest into regenerative sources. Critizise us for that latter, not the former.",1647706502.0,7

10594,worldnews,Poland proposes total EU ban on trade with Russia,,1647690301.0,1569,42301,0.94,Lost-My-Mind-,"Well see a ""dick"" is common slang for a ""penis"", which is the male reproductive organ. These can come in various sizes, and having a large one is generally seen to be something to be proud of. If you confidently show off your penis, you're seen as being the alpha in a situation. This generally attracts women who want to stick this penis inside their vagina for reproductive, or recreational purposes. 

A ""pussy"" is common slang for ""vagina"", which is the female reproductive organ. And while the previous post barely mentioned vaginas, they are seen as being fragile and weak, due to a double standard in society. When in reality, the male reproductive organs are the ones which are sensitive and weak, more specifically the testicles. When inflicted any pain, the testicle reacts to this sudden blunt force with much more pain than any other part of the human body. Whereas the vagina can and does literally stretch so far as to push a human child out of it when needed. Still though, the fact remains that ""Dicks"" are seen as the strong powerful imagery, while ""Pussies"" are seen as the weak submissive types.

And an ""asshole"" is common slang for the rectal sphincter. It's medical purpose is to allow an opening to allow human waste to pass out of the human body, while closing tight when not in use, as to not allow foreign particles inside. However, a common practice among both heterosexuals, and especially homosexuals is to use the asshole as a sexual recreational bodily opening in which to have sexual intercourse. A societal outlook is that assholes are bad, due to their usage of human waste that passes through them. So to be viewed at as an asshole, would be to say you are scum. 

And ""Team America"" is a 2004 American film by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who also created the popular Comedy Central series ""South Park"". The film depicts and mocks an unrelenting use of patriotic imagery to make fun of people with such patriotic feelings masking their lack of a personality. The film was in direct response to a post 9/11 world, in which many Americans let their patriotism get out of hand. 

So the post above is essentially saying that Putin, Kim Jong Un and Assad are the scum of this planet while China and the United States are big and powerful with confidence in theirselves. 

He's also implying that the entirety of the EU needs to develop some confidence so they can be seen as big and powerful, so they too may play on the world stage with the other powerful nations.

I agree with Poland's position right now, but when Germany's anti nuclear groups were supported by Russia, to increase dependence on Russian gas, Polish anti EU, anti NATO political parties were and still are similarly supported. The same disinformation was heavily influencing Poland to be pro trump, who was planning for US to leave NATO.

The Kremlin released an official photo of Putin earlier in the week, and instead of projecting power, people saw a man they thought looked bloated and ashen faced. It contributed to speculation that he has malignant bowel cancer. Some thought the bloating could be from steroids to fight the cancer.

There are also a couple of videos of Putin struggling with his hands. They seem to shake uncontrollably - the right side more than the left. Some think it could be a form of Parkinson‚Äôs-like illness induced by the malignant cancer. There‚Äôs one video where the hand shakes wildly, and another where it looks like dead weight as he tries to wave.

As horrible of a person as he is, he‚Äôs not stupid. He‚Äôs meticulous, he‚Äôs measured, and he‚Äôs always planning. He‚Äôs been planning a takeover of Ukraine for years, and he was waiting for Trump to pull out of NATO to really seize his opportunity. Trump doesn‚Äôt, Trump loses, no big deal, we‚Äôll just keep planning. See if we can find a weak point in time. Then strike Ukraine, take over, roll over neighboring countries, and cement your legacy as the man who brought the Russian Empire back to USSR strength.

And then, the unthinkable. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to die soon‚Äù says a doctor who mysteriously disappeared two days later in a tragic accident that others may learn from. You can‚Äôt cement your legacy if you don‚Äôt even try. So what do you do? You go for it. You expect a relatively easy fight, so you try to blitzkrieg the Ukrainians and force a surrender right away. Then you look more powerful, you have more land, you have more people, and you have more talking power.

As you wait for the Ukrainian President to run and flee or say ‚ÄúWe surrender!‚Äù, the unthinkable happens again. He will not leave. He‚Äôs fighting with his people. And they are fucking winning.

Now what? Your military was not prepared for a super long battle. Tanks are losing gas, soldiers are surrendering and saying they don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre here, and you can‚Äôt take control of the capital. Okay, well, everything‚Äôs fine. Just so long as NATO and specifically the US don‚Äôt come after you.

And then, you guessed it, the unthinkable. NATO, in a shocking turn of events, denounce what you‚Äôre doing and say they may have to take action if you‚Äôre not careful. Well, what do you do? You threaten them. Remind them that you can end the world if you want to, so don‚Äôt touch me. But now your people see you as weak, so you have to pivot and point the blame on the western countries. Eventually, you know that that kind of rhetoric will at least get China to help.

Yeah, I don‚Äôt have to explain what‚Äôs next.

Your friends won‚Äôt come to your side, you look like a maniac on the international front and a weak leader to your own citizens, you‚Äôre 3 weeks into a 15-day-max fight, your economy is collapsing, don‚Äôt even think about trade, this show-of-strength for Russia is looking more like a dumpster fire, and the worst part of all is that in an attempt to make yourself look like the greatest leader in the world, you have made the leader of the country you‚Äôre attacking the hero of the situation.

Putin will absolutely die soon. And, to his credit, he has officially cemented his legacy. But it will never be the legacy he wanted.",1647712496.0,3

The Social Security Administration maintains a¬†life expectancy calculator¬†that will tell you the average number of additional years a person with your date of birth and gender can expect to live. Using this calculator, a 65-year-old woman born on Jan. 1, 1955, has a life expectancy of 86.6 years. And if she makes it to age 70, her life expectancy increases to 87.6 years. A man the same age has an average life expectancy of 84.1 years.

Anyone even remotely suspicious they ask that they don't come in that day. No doubt they have marksman in elevated positions. And that's for the US, yet alone somewhere actively under attack.             

The presidential limousine is in all likelihood the most armored ""civilian"" vehicle in the world, it's actually built on a truck chassis and designed to look like a normal stretch limousine but if you ever look at the size, the thickness of the doors and windows it is far from normal; hence why it comedically got stuck a few years back when it was in Dublin.        


I just don't see it happening.       
They'll need an armored division, squadrons of Army helicopters and Air Force jet aircraft, and quite possibly a thousand or more troops on the ground to secure every corner to do this. Not to mention they'd have the US Navy roll up into the Black Sea with a literal fleet.      

The undertaking of getting the entourage that would have to accompany the POTUS into an active war zone would be similar in scope to an armed intervention. The logistical challenges, the man power, the money would not be something to scoff at. All so Biden could have a chat with Zelenskyy. If they did this, those US troops would be *pissed* at the waste of time and money since they wouldn't even be able to help Ukraine.        

If the POTUS forced his hand and made the Secret Service to agree to such a thing, the amount of military forces that will have to be moved can quite seriously be enough to topple a country or defeat many militaries of those countries in a conventional war. (not accounting for resupplying)

Allow me to clarify: they are *currently standing* because of the West's constant military support since 2014 that has only amplified since the war, and financial *warfare* on Russia.

I know it's easy to personify a nation, but in the grand scheme of things a nation's desperation isn't really the same blind ""drowning, flailing and grabbing onto others"" personal panic. They have a choice in how they present themselves. Hell, in the beginning of the war before Russia fully revealed themselves to be trash, Ukraine's government was doing *great* in keeping poise, and that was when things were initially, truly bleak. 

There is no such thing as ""all they are getting."" That implies they *deserve* more. That Ukraine *deserves* to have NATO's people die for them en masse. But they don't. That implies that the West is cheaping out and turning a blind eye. But they aren't. That implies that they are entitled to... frankly *anything* from NATO. But they aren't. That's the cold truth: NATO didn't need to do anything, because if Russia touches NATO, they die.

Getting into the fight is and should be NATO's choice, because Ukraine isn't a part of NATO. 

It is like a homeless man harassing you(and also trying to *con* you) because you gave them a hundred dollars instead of inviting them into your home like family.

It's ludicrous to see so many try and give Ukraine's government a pass for everything because ""oh they need to care about their people"" as if NATO *doesn't* and as if NATO stepping in wouldn't turn Ukraine into *a wasteland.*",1647704706.0,19

For some reason, we tend to view gay romances as ""sexual romances"", while we don't have the same standard for straight romances.

We see straight romances happen in children's media *all the time*. Any time the kids in Ed Edd n Eddy get flustered and stammer over Naz, any time a kid in Avatar the Last Airbender has a crush on another kid, literally any cartoon involving Mickey and Minnie Mouse is a children's cartoon about a heterosexual romance.  

Beyond romances, we just see heterosexual attraction in general, any time Buggs Bunny puts on drag to try to lure a male opponent, or Pepe LePew tries to kiss a feminized cat, or Johnny Bravo tries (and fails) to hit up women.

Romance is a natural part of children's media, kids really are used to it. We don't need to fear that a gay romance is somehow more sexual than any Disney Princess meeting their Prince Charming.",1647721363.0,4

This phase of ice could exists in abundance in expected water-rich planets outside of our solar system, meaning they could have conditions habitable for life",,1647697468.0,448,13469,0.95,gavilin,"As someone with a bit of a chemistry background, I can try to explain. To have life, you need a way to store information in molecules that can be replicated. Carbon chains are some of the most flexible chemicals in terms of stability and also ease of covalent bonding with a range of atoms, forming more complicated functional groups. The issue is there are a finite number of elements to work with. About 90 or so. Carbon is the best of these. Water is then a useful choice because it has oxygen and hydrogen in it, two of the elements that work best with carbon.

Next, you need life to be in the liquid phase. That's just a practical issue. Gases will just float apart, and solids don't really work because if I have a pile of nutrients over here and a pile of nutrients over there that need to mix, they don't just jump onto each other. liquids naturally facilitate the mixing of chemicals, and so all life that we know of is liquid-based (your cells are full of liquid, called cytoplasm).

Once you have down that it needs to be a liquid, and you need to use carbon, you get restricted a bit in terms of temperature, because too hot and the carbon molecules you built out of carbon start to fall apart, and too cold and the reaction rates necessary for life get too slow (this is intuitive but reactions happen slower or not at all at low temperatures). So not too hot, not too cold.

The last piece is you really need a solvent that is polar. This means that it has positive and negative ends. That's because polar solvents can dissolve other polar molecules (letting them move around) but don't dissolve non-polar molecules (so they can stay put together and do things). Having this ability to have some things get moved around and others stay together points to having a polar solvent, and Water happens to be a very polar solvent.

Water ticks all of these boxes better than basically anything else. It's possible you could have life in a different liquid solvent like Dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol, but these other choices are either more complicated and unlikely to form a lot of naturally, or are too unstable and could lead to chain reactions with oxygen that result in the production of water anyway.",1647704914.0,11

To provide a reference, the pressure at a point close to the center of the Earth is estimated to be somewhere between 350 to 400 GPa (don't quote me on this, I'm using a range for a reason).

2 TPa is close 5x the pressure experienced close to the center of the Earth.

A heat pump installation with a ground source using vertical borehole loops would typically require three 70 to 100 meter deep loops. 

But these passively recharge and have a low temperature, boosting the temperature by running the loop in charge mode from a heat pump that was powered by such a solar PV-thermal collector in the summer and on warmer, sunnier days, could allow the loop to provide several times the capacity.

At ¬£25 to ¬£40 per meter the quoted drilling costs for such systems, slashing the number of bore holes needed, i.e. from 3 to 1, would present the potential for large installation savings.

Nope: People are saying that nuclear may explode, and render a large amount of land uninhabitable for a thousand years or so.

You're assurances of safety are worthless: Where were you in 2010? Were you warning the world about the dangers of Fukushima? Nope. Nobody said it was dangerous until *after* it exploded.

Likewise, you're not warning us about the dangers of any of the hundreds of nuclear power plants operating today: But any one of them could also explode next year due to ""unforeseen circumstances"".

Back in the 1970s we would have had to cover the roof and maybe have the panels adjust their angle over the course of the day. But now they are so efficient that fixed panels are more than enough. The inverter is the size of a notebook computer, and it's plug hand-play.

Our refrigerator and lights are also much more efficient. In 20 years, panels may have gained more efficiency while being lighter and cheaper.

It's not an investment that everyone can make. We took advantage of low interest rates after the 2007 financial crisis, and years later we had an inheritance that paid it off. But solar will continue to become more efficient before it levels off.

Not exact and not literally had the typical role of servant like many modern people would assume today. But nonetheless, I believe they received the same total Hollywood bullcrap hype which ‚ÄòCowboys‚Äô also did. 

Now for all of you who think Cowboys to be white Americans riding horseback, full of charm and personality, gunslingers either being outlaw villains or outlaw heroes; I got news for ya; none of that‚Äôs true. 

They weren‚Äôt sitting in saloons all day, playing poker, drinking whiskey and using the services of the brothel, as is portrayed in film. No, they wouldn‚Äôt afford that, they wouldn‚Äôt have time for that; they had jobs! They would work all day and were probably covered in cow poop. 

They were predominantly Mexicans. They were called cowboys because‚Ä¶ guess what‚Ä¶ they tended to their cattle all day, every day for much of their lives. They weren‚Äôt heroes or villains running around on horsies doing incredible things. 

Nobody ran around shooting people. There was law and order. The people who did carry guns; were mostly responsible with it; never armed themselves in town, that was against the law. And the government; which was very active and enforced the law would have taken your guns away and/or out you in jail for being so reckless. 

Guns (predominantly rifles) were used as protection, not from cowboys, but from the wild. The west was a scary place back then (still is), people had to protect themselves from bears and other wildlife that were terrifying to a settler new to the land. Or mostly to protect their cows, cattle and other farm/ranch animals from the wild Wild West. 

There weren‚Äôt crazy shootouts. Most of them were made up Hollywood stories for film. Most of the characters told in folklore and film were‚Ä¶ yes fake, I‚Äôm sorry fine ladies and gentlemen of the Reddit. 

Cowboys were short, brown people who probably didn‚Äôt speak much English, if any, probably didn‚Äôt carry any weapons on them, if they did; it were to protect their cows; hence ‚ÄòCowboy!‚Äô

Yeehaw! Oh and yes! ‚ÄòBoy‚Äô was quite accurate in the sense that it was mostly a boys job to herd and tend to cattle. These weren‚Äôt big scary butch men stomping around. Short little brown boys, thems were! 

So yes, off on my little tangent however, it circles back around to the similarities of made up fictional stories to make stuff sound more interesting then they were. Most ‚Äòsamurai‚Äô didn‚Äôt dance around on rooftop slicing enemies in half with their mighty blades, cutting down foes with legendary skill of bow and arrow. They served their masters like special and talented butlers. Probably acted as bodyguards and knew some interesting stuff and how to handle themselves in a scuffle. 

However, not the fantasy levels of insane combat you see in Hollywood film or hear in ambitious tales of wild assassins and masters of weaponry. 

Cowboys served their cows. Samurai served their daimyo. I look at it similarly how modern day people falsely perceive police to be ‚Äòon the beat‚Äô all the time. Solving crime, in gunfights, bar fights and all around action! But no, it‚Äôs 90% paperwork and sitting at a desk. Unless you‚Äôre part of TMU (traffic management unit) then their desk is the car, do lots of paperwork while talking to annoying drunks. Nothing crazy happens. 

Much the same how I perceive cowboys, samurai and other similar were like in their time. Samurai acted as ‚Äòlandlords‚Äô often under their daimyo. So no, they weren‚Äôt having crazy sword battles all the time. They were collecting rent‚Ä¶",1647718209.0,1

The custom of keeping goldfish is believed to date back more than 2,000 years. Goldfish are believed to have come originally from reddish-colored specimens that were discovered among the wild carp that live in southern China. Goldfish came to Japan in the middle of the Muromachi Period (1336-1573); at this time, goldfish were kept by the nobility and wealthy people of the day for their personal amusement.""

‚Äú In July 2010, a goldfish measuring 16 inches (41 cm) and 5 pounds (2.3 kg) was caught in a pond in Poole, England, thought to have been abandoned there after outgrowing a tank. On November 16, 2020, a 15 inch (38.1 cm) 9 pound (4.1 kg) goldfish was found in a 16-acre (6.5 ha) lake in Greenville, South Carolina, while conducting a population survey of Oak Grove Lake.‚Äù

We once endured a lecture from a budo professor (because japan worship happens in japan as well as all the weebs).

Every time he brought up a ""bushido code"" thing in front of some hundred hard core budo people they asked ""What about so and so in year X with so and so""

The answer was always basically ""oh but he really wanted to, so it's okay"".

My opinion is samurai were once bloodthirsty and successful fighters that became a caste system and then the wars stopped and they became public servants to earn money then they became mythologised and then politicised.

In many cases they just happen to be the strongest local bully who got those who were weaker to support them and make food for them.

Of course it goes all across the spectrum in terms of what actually happened and there were likely asshats along with people who were serious about their service to others.  In other words... they were people with all the craziness that happens with that.  And like with people in general, trying to paint a broad stereotype about their behavior is treading on dangerous ground.

I agree also that if you are talking about samuari you need to specify the era in regards to what role they actually served and also with regards to general expectations that both the top rulers as well as the common peasants viewed those samurai, but my point is that the OP above making such a sweeping statement is just simply false.

I look at samurai as mostly semi-professional soldiers who had crude training and were supported by peasants where they lived.  And how ""bloodthirsty"" they may have been is largely like what you see even with modern professional soldiers.  They were successful so far as Japan still exists today as a modern country thanks in part to their existence in the past.  It is a big part of the history of Japan.",1647720995.0,1

If I recall correctly I think a major reason behind Churchill‚Äôs ‚Äúwe will fight them on the beaches‚Äù speech was to assure allies that even if the nazis took over great britain, they would take their navy and scoot it all over to newfoundland or something rather than hand it over to the germans (which is what the vichy french would go on to do.)

It cannot be understated that at the outbreak of WWII, the IJN and RN (japanese and british navies) were basically peers with the US navy, and how devastating it would have been for the allies if the british surrendered to the germans like the french did or even just sued for peace and stayed out of the war. The germans would have had access to resources and raw materials that could sustain the war effort and likely would have not felt pressed to invade the USSR in an attempt to grab oil and wheat fields. At that point, the war would have been pretty much won in Europe.

On the other hand, if the Pearl Harbor attack had reached its strategic aims and actually destroyed US aircraft carriers and logistics, Japan would have had free reign over the pacific.

For the allies, being able access and maintain supply lines to an entire continent out of reach of their enemies (something the germans and Japanese tried to also take for themselves in invading the USSR and China/SEA respectively) was ultimately the deciding factor in the outcome of the war. While the axis had early military successes, they could not keep their war machine going the same way that factories in the US and USSR could once it became a war of attrition, and particularly the more planes and fuel they could make the more they could destroy axis industrial capacity, and it became unwinnable for them at that point. While I hesitate to give all the credit to a single event or person, Churchill‚Äôs speech denied them the option of cashing in while they were still on top and while many in the UK were seriously considering tapping out of the war.

To really underscore the point of how important all this was, I‚Äôd like to point this out: It‚Äôs one thing to recognize the unsurprising fact that the US was number 1 at the end of the war, but another to point out that by the end of the war, Canada, a country with 8% of the population of the US, had the 4th largest navy in the world, after the US, UK, and USSR, and Canadian factories had built more trucks than the axis powers combined.",1647711692.0,52

The defeat of the army in 1940 didn't imply a failure of the navy or the air force. They were also not going to stay out of it, if not for ideological opposition to fascism then more mundanely the British interest in a balance of power in Europe where they are on top. There wasn't any real path for UK-German peace once the actual war got going, too many conflicting interests. 

The goal of Pearl Harbor was to knock out the battleships, and that's what the Japanese did. They hit all the targets they wanted. The problem is that they didn't include repair facilities, submarines, or fuel depots as targets to hit. The carriers were both not at Pearl Harbor that day and were not targets anyway.

The primary goal of the German war was always going to be Eastern Europe. The idea of delaying war in the east would only be advantageous to the Soviets due to their rapid buildup that was already underway. Soviet expectation was that the Germans were so reliant on materials shipments from the Soviets that the Germans wouldn't be able to realistically attempt the war with them until 1942. By then they would have had more KV1s and T34s, which were capable of stopping whole German formations by themselves during Barbarossa (until they ran out of ammunition and fuel).

Again, for the alternate history to happen where Suez falls it would require the political interests to be different than they were.

The ""main reason for the war"" was the getting land for German settlers in the east. Oil was the means to that end. The goal for Germany was always establishing a German empire in Eastern Europe once they got rid of all the Slavs and Jews and communists. Theoretically had the Nazis won against the Soviets then they would try to turn their attention to fighting the US, since the US was supposed to be the center of Jewish power in the world after the Soviet Union. But that would have to be decades after the 40s. 

Spain under Franco was friendly with Germany as a fellow fascist regime, they were never under threat from Germany and had actually offered to join the Axis in 1940. Germany refused since Spain was asking for more than Germany was willing to accept for participation, and Spain wasn't really in a position to offer much military strength anyway.

Turkey was always leaning towards the Allies due to its own political interests clashing with German and Italian interests. And for Turkey to be seriously threatened it would require diversion of German and Italian military force from their already overextended commitments. It was never really under threat from the Axis.

Again, for the alternate history to happen it would require the political interests to be different than they were. The British didn't know at the time but it was not tenable politically for the Germans to take the lead in Africa due to being the Italian sphere. That's why Afrika Korps was sent as a supplement for the Italian forces. If the Germans had committed at the scale necessary, it's unlikely they would have been prepared to invade the Soviet Union at all. Knowing that the primary German goal was Eastern Europe is important to understanding why they acted as they did. Further delay for the invasion in the east would have meant the Soviets were even better prepared.

Uhm, no. That was primarily propaganda.

The ban was brought on by the lumber/paper industry. The nascent plastics industry was also involved in banning marijuana and hemp. (they didn't want the cheaper hemp used for paper and other products. )  


""William Randolph Hearst was a major newspaper publisher during the 1900‚Äôs. The main feature of his work was yellow journalism, nowadays known as sensationalist reporting. This, he thought, would maximise newspaper circulation and revenue. Hearst used large volumes of paper made from pulping trees. DuPont supplied many of the bleaching materials and chemicals used in this process. Hearst was uninterested in using paper made from the pulp of hemp plants which could be grown so easily in places such as Mexico and the deep south. Hearst would base his headlines on populist themes. His anti-Mexican, anti-black and anti-immigrant message was eagerly absorbed by the early newspaper consumers. Many of the claims and stories were taken as fact. Hearst developed a strong anti-marijuana theme partly to marginalise the immigrants that he so despised. Inevitably, an anti-cannabis bias was established. Sensational reporting of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants while high on cannabis was common place. The early newspaper industry had done a good job demonising cannabis. This made it easy for the USA to ban it.""

The reason why psychotropic drugs threaten organized religion is because anyone can do them.

When so many of the great religions of today obscure the potential for divine connection behind ritual, that means drugs are kind of like a cheat code. 

Religious leaders don't like that because it cheapens their whole racket, for lack of a better term.

Alan Watts, while not the greatest source, does have some great thoughts about religion and hallucinogens but the general thrust of the speech I most enjoyed comes down to: ""yeah, they're a cheat code but does that make the experience any less educationally divine?""

The ones with fortune cookies (although I don't see them that often here) are completely americanized; stuff like ""mongolian beef"" or ""general tao's (or tsao or tso or however many other variations on the name) chicken"" doesn't exist in China and no one in China would have heard of it. 

This is especially true for places where there isn't a huge chinese dispora like in vancouver/toronto/LA etc. 

Now in terms of the restuarants here, where there is a very significant chinese population (a few years ago, there was outrage in Richmond, a suburb city of greater vancouver because so many stores don't have ANY english at all), it's mostly because of several factors (IMO; I'm not a researcher, this is just what I feel like is happening):

1. A difference in ingredients. It's not that Chinese ingredients are more ""fresh"" (or as many people think, worse); but it's different. For example, I eat a lot of beef, it's my favorite meat. But I avoid beef in China like the plague because it's absolutely horrible and harder than shoe leather. On the other hand, there are other things (like tofu) that is much better (and there are a lot more different types) in China. And the types of vegetables that are common is slightly different too; scallions/green onions in China is different from what I get here in supermarkets just as one example.

2. It's a lot better now, but even 10 years ago, a lot of commonly used Chinese ingredients like various types of fermented pastes and veggies, sauces, spices etc couldn't be easily found here. So people have to use substitutes. 

3. There's a mixture of various regional cuisines; China has 1.3 billion people, and is one of the largest countries in the world in terms of size. So there are lots of regional differences between different parts of China; it's like British cuisine, French cuisine and Italian cuisine might be concerned different, but there's probably even more variance in Chinese cuisine. But that kind of gets all mixed up here, and the differences between different types of chinese cuisine isn't as pronounced. And almost everything here has cantonese influences because such a huge percentage of the Chinese dispora in NA was cantonese (before ~2005 or so). Whereas in mainland China, Cantonese cuisine is limited to the province of Guangzhou and restuarants that specifically make cantonese cuisine elsewhere. It isn't blended into other regional cuisines.

edit: Oh, also, there's stuff that's really popular and cheap in China, and likely popular because it's cheap, but there's very little of it here because the costs of creating the same thing would be much higher, and no one would buy it at such a high price.

For example, Lan Zhou beef noodle soup is AMAZING. I try to have it as much as I can when I go back to China. 
But I can't find a single lan zhou beef noodle soup restaurant here. 

Another thing is yang rou chuan; charcoal grilled lamb skewers (although I personally like the beef tendons, chicken, enoki mushroom, cabbage skewers more, but I digress) is super famous and popular around China. 

I'd eat like 50 skewers a meal, because it used to be about 3 for 1RMB back 15 years ago, and is still like 1-2RMB per skewer. So like, 20 bucks a meal, not too pricey.

But a place tried to make those skewers here, but went out of business because they're not making any profit, despite selling a skewer for $3.5 each. No way I'm spending $150-200 on a meal. 

There's also my favorite breakfast ever; tofu brains. And a lot more.",1647706833.0,4

This was back when there was a thin tissue on the border, it was very easy to move between the countries. Still, he didn't have a permanent resident permit (ie green card) until 1970, so all his recording and performing work in the US was as an illegal immigrant, including his appearance at Woodstock. So...

If he did hot-wire a truck, or even participated in stealing a truck, he committed a felony, and had he been caught, would have been immediately expelled from the US after his conviction and sentence, and likely not permitted to re-enter the US for some time, even forever. And never been allowed his dual citizenship.

We both watched them constantly move the goal posts for ""vaccines"", treatments, masks, forced vaccinations, the lies about how it will stop the spread, the lies about efficacy, the lies about preventing infection, the lies about saying they would never resort to vax passes and so much more. Whats clear is we should have done masks for everyone no if ands or buts until this ends. Everything else has been ineffective at best and much worse in many cases. They can only lie about this stuff so many times before its obvious we only got a tiny part of the truth. Fact is it mostly effected the obese and the elderly. The lied about over 800 pediatric deaths that number was revised this week by the CDC same for total deaths which suddenly were reduced by another 80,000. When your off by tens of thousands and then try to intentionally hide the data used to justify the injectable its obvious that there needs to be a federal inquiry into what really happened here and peoples heads need to roll starting with faucis who has mislead this entire shit show from day one. First masks for all then no masks dont work then cloth masks work now then the vaccine will stop the virus and stop the spread then its well it doesnt totally stop the spread to well you can get infected but we think it helps probably to you can get 4 shots and still get infected.
