I high school I took drivers ed and one of the vehicles we had to drive was a Rambler with a 3 on the column. Everyone in the classes had to drive that old car. After that a 4 or more on the floor was easy.

Then there was the old, and I mean really old small truck we had at my summer job. I worked at a lodge in a national park in a neighboring state one summer. There was this old truck that was a floor shift which was really the easy part. The hard part was that there was a choke that had to be set just right or you would flood the engine or it would refuse to start.

One day I was waiting tables for breakfast and got called outside to the truck. All the guys from the garage were there along with all the housekeeping staff who were trying to get to their assigned cabins. No one could start the truck. I got in, set the choke, and started that old truck right up. Seems they had flooded the engine but, while they waited for someone to get me from the dining room enough fuel had drained and setting the choke properly made it just turn over right away.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",1647302435.0,855

lol

OK... it wasn't stolen. And it technically wasn't my first stick ever... I grew up on a farm where having access to stick was a norm so I'd been introduced to the concepts in a growing form (note that tractors and the sort have very different transmissions so don't match 1:1 with a car's tranny).

But the day that I learned to drive an actual stick, all on my own with no assistance, was when I was around 12. My dad was a truck driver who hauled cars. And I'd ride with him all the time to ""spend time"", or to just travel. Like if I was going to visit him in Florida for the summer, I'd ride in the truck rather than fly.

Well he was moving a porsche down for a friend of a friend on heavy discount as a favor. And the guy was being a total dick bag about it and was going to stiff my pops on the money because he thought he could get away with it due to the relationship that tied the 2 together (lets just say my dad was in some unsavory side business back when he was alive).

So my dad was going to have to eat the loss on this one.

Well, while sitting in the palm beach auto auction where he was unloading the rest of his load. He tossed me the keys to the porsche and said:

""I think it's about time you learn to drive stick.""

For 2 hours I drove around that auto auction lighting that clutch on fire!

In my experience it's usually the people who hill hold and the people who constantly rest their foot against the clutch when they're not shifting. Hill holding is absolutely awful for your clutch and is a bandaid for people's inability to do hill starts without rolling back, and the foot resting there often turns into slightly riding the clutch 100% of the time without noticing. Lot of people also constantly rest their hand on the shifter (I call it Vin Dieseling) which tends to cause unnecessary synchro wear.

That's not the only reason valets are used.   

Some times the parking lot is small and you can't fit all the cars into the spaces (i.e. cars need to be blocked in).   In those cases a valet has access to all the cars keys, and can move cars as needed to get them in and out.

Other times valets have specific lots they have access to as well for parking cars.

Sometimes it's simply convenience rather than laziness.   You're at a hotel, you're checking in, you have bags.

Drove the wheels off that thing for 2.5 years, putting well over 50,000 miles on it, driving it cross country, taking it on mild off-roading by accident because I didn't check the route beforehand. I did it all and loved that car every inch of the journey even if it tried to kill me in winter a couple times.

Then somebody attempted to steal it from the underground apartment parking garage it was usually parked in. They broke the driver's door lock, ruined the keyless entry system in the process, and broke off a screwdriver in the ignition trying to force it to start. Then they got pissed off at their attempt not working, grabbed a trash can, and threw all the garbage into my car plus the can itself before cutting up the seats and convertible top some for good measure.

I had loved that car, but honestly after finding it like that my feelings for it died in a hurry. It was never the same afterwards, even though my insurance took great care of me and went above and beyond to avoid totaling it out and making me better than whole, but I just didn't feel the same about it afterwards. There were little things you'd notice that had been changed/damaged but couldn't be noticed until after the repairs were completed and car picked up, such as the guy mistaking the airbag for a glovebox and now it was slightly loose from their prying attempts and the speaking wiring underneath was damaged causing it to cut in and out on hot days (unless you pressed on the airbag they had tried to pry out).

It's hard to feel the same about a car after something like that, and in hindsight if I did it again I would've let them just total it out and gone about looking for another dream car to replace it.

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off ‚Äújust over a block‚Äù from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I‚Äôd been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I‚Äôd been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

Yknow, because i was ""nice"". That gave her about three weeks. I went on an impromptu road trip with my buddy about two weeks into it and when I got back, she let me know she had moved out while i was away, so about a week prior.

When I got back to my apartment, every single thing I  owned was piled up, in the center of the living room. This isn't an exaggeration. The apartment looked ready to rent to new tenants, except for the massive pile of furniture, collectibles, clothing, medicine cabinet contents, food from the fridge and pantry and since it was June...fucking MAGGOTS!! It took a week to really sort through. I kept finding more fucked up stuff, like my childhood teddy bear, ripped at his neck, so his head just dangled there, 25 year old stuffing, bleeding out. I kept imagining her, dragging heavy shit around, carrying on with this for days, probably.

850,AskReddit,What's the craziest thing an ex friend/lover has done to you?,into_the_void22,1647290157.0,3589,8649,0.94,"Had a teacher in HS that I got close to in grades 10-12, I'd call him a friend. When I didn't want to take any of the available classes, he got the principal to approve a class (Sociology 3, in case you're curious) where it would be just me in the class and he ""taught"" it. I didn't have to do shit but hang out with him for an entire period and got an A. Solid deal.

Well, I graduated at semester and he bought me a grad card. He'd filled every single blank space with tiny writing about how much he loved me and couldn't he just keep me. If he couldn't he was feeling like he would kill himself. 

As I type this now, I'm getting creeped out but at 17 I was too naive to see that for what it was, and I'm only giving you about half the story here. Anyway, that's my crazy friend story. Last I heard he quit his job of 20+ years after I graduated and moved to CO. Idk what happened to him from there. 

EDIT: ok, I'm getting some messages about elaborating on this. To be clear, I don't have any trauma associated with the situation.

The relationship started when I was 15. I went to a tiny rural school and even then I stood out in a crowd. Not a brag, it's relevant to understanding how this all came about. 

The teacher was in his late 40s. Never married, and as I learned later, never even had a girlfriend. Very quiet type. I was going through some things at home and I needed a trusted adult. I was drawn to him and confided several things to him, and he was a true friend when I needed one. You can simultaneously be very beautiful and very lonely, as I learned early in life. I took to spending a lot of time in his room, just talking, playing on the chalkboard, nothing more. 

The next year our talks turned to boys, and he tried to give me some advice about not falling for the BS that high school boys do to get in your pants. He was very critical of boys I dated, always pointing out flaws and such. I started driving that year and that put him on edge because he didn't always know the boys I went out with personally. He was constantly asking if I was ok, was I comfortable doing what boys and girls that age do...it seemed like he was looking out for me, protecting me and I believe he was.

I visited him at his house, but he didn't make advances or anything. He did call me in the evenings and weekends quite a bit. He had a stuffed bear I'd given him which he named after me, usually he'd call to say he and ____Bear missed me. 

My senior year was when we had the 1 on 1 class but again it was just talking although by that point we were so close people noticed it. I think I knew he was in love with me, but he never touched me except for a hug here and there and never asked for anything that would make me uncomfortable. 

Other than the card, he never did anything odd. We confided a lot in each other, and we were two people who needed one another at the time. If I had to do it again I'd make the same choices. I remember when I read the card being deeply sad and sorry for him that I couldn't return the kind of love he had. For me he was a dear friend and nothing more. I remember him fondly and hope he's well, wherever he is.",1647297807.0,359

They started threatening me and my career to keep it quiet, including at a professional conference, so I asked the meeting organizers to get them away from me, and they did. The threats doubled.

I reported their conduct to their institution so they knew about it (and apparently they already did and had taken action on some of it already). Professional society said they would tell them to leave me alone and I thought that'd be the end of it.

Every month or so they would harass me online. I ignored it, and documented it. Then out of the blue, an anonymous social media account shows up posting death threats against this colleague, and trying to associate those threats with me - that I was responsible for their life being threatened. This colleague posted on their blog that they were in personal danger, further associating it with me. I sent the anonymous account a link to a webpage that grabbed their IP address and device information- and of course it was them posting fake threats against their self. I caught them in the act.

They are still experiencing the consequences of their own actions, and have learned no lessons to this date. Banned from conferences, job duties changed, and restrictions on activities. It's so convoluted and bizarre - making fake death threats against one's self to claim that someone else is out to get them, with no provocation.

1) Ex held me hostage in a hotel room for two hours by physically assaulting me and preventing me from leaving. She stole my phone and laptop and tore the hotel phone cord out of the wall so I couldn‚Äôt use it to get out. I refused to fight back so I just took a beating including having a whole ass pizza thrown at me. I finally got out but the cops were only interested if I hit her back so when they found out she didn‚Äôt (after endless questioning all about MY response) they didn‚Äôt give a fuck. 

2) ex tried to kill herself in front of me after we broke up. She told me she would kill herself if I didn‚Äôt go to her place, so I called her parents and told them what she said. They asked me to just go check on her, against my better judgement I did. After screaming at me and trying to push me down a flight of stairs she ran into the kitchen, broke a glass, and started slashing her wrists. I had to tackle her to the ground and pinned her there and then used a free hand to call 911. She was screaming that I was trying to kill her while on the phone with dispatch, but she eventually stopped. Luckily the cops could clearly see what had happened when they arrived and they didn‚Äôt hassle me over it.

3) Most recent ex and the reason I‚Äôm not dating for fucking ever, been dating for 4 years, all is well in our relationship, plans to get married. One day she grabs two of our cats and ran out the door with them while I cooked us dinner. Drove away. Doesn‚Äôt answer phone. Two days later I hear from her parents that she texted everyone we knew that I had been physically abusing her for years and that I had illegal weapons and that I threatened to kill her with my guns. Her parents called me because they knew that‚Äôs not me and warned me to get the fuck away from her for my safety. Turns out she got committed to a mental hospital after her friends realized what she was saying about me wasn‚Äôt true and that she was truly having a psychotic episode (lots more to this story). She had told her friends my deepest secrets breaking so much trust and my heart. I had to explain to people that I wasn‚Äôt a murderer or abuser and it was awful to have people I love and care about even for a moment believe the worst about me. Cops got called on me by my friends but for some reason they never showed up.

Hers was very direct. Name, date of birth, blood type, pregnant/not pregnant with thr signature od the doctor at the bottom.

Some would ask, well how did you not know if she was lying? I moved a couple of hours away and had no vehicle. But I fully believed that she would birth a child out of spite for me. She did a lot of crazy things during our relationship. Hell, she was the reason I got cuffed and taken to jail. She claimed I hit her and she had a bruise on her leg from what the officer told me.

She is FULL of anger and hate. Always getting back at someone or plotting some kind of revenge. She never thinks shes out of line.

He cheated on her constantly, and she hated him, but for some reason she believed that she had to stay with him because she lost her virginity with him and that it would be wrong to have sex with another person. 

Anyways, crazy story is, he saved my mother‚Äôs life twice. Once, she was scheduled to have a job interview in a twin tower in New York, like half an hour before it fell, and he convinced her not to take the job because it was too far away (she lived in New Jersey). So she skipped the interview, went to her current job, and found out about 9-11 because a woman ran down the hall screaming that her daughter was in one of the towers. 

Second time, her college professor convinced her that there was a big law conference (she was a law major) that the whole class was going to. When her boyfriend dropped her off to the meeting location, there were no buses, no chaperones, no other people‚Ä¶.just the professor in his car. He said he could drive her to the hotel and they would meet everyone there. He never specified what hotel, where the trip was at, and who else was going. So my mom went to the boyfriend‚Äôs car and told him about it. Immediately the dude knew something was off, and told her to go over to the professor and tell him sternly ‚ÄúI am not going. If you don‚Äôt give me an A for the year, I‚Äôm calling the cops‚Äù. The professor didn‚Äôt even try to deny anything. He just stared at her, said ‚Äúok‚Äù, and sped off.

Except, this was a hired driver from the firm I used to work at that dropped us off at the strip club after I explicitly said I didn‚Äôt want to go. It was my 21st birthday and I was hammered - everyone else already went home. He kept shoving drinks down my throat and shoveling drinks my way.

Dozens of people saw this go down and I was bleeding from both knees. Two girls came up to me and asked me if I was okay and offered a ride. I asked who they were and where and why they would help me - they both picked me up and threw me in the car and tried to fcking kidnap me. They thought I was so intoxicated I couldn‚Äôt defend myself. I demanded to be let out of the car multiple times and finally I realized I had my cell phone. I called 911 on speakerphone and told them I was being taken, they slammed the brakes and threw me out and sped off.

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

On addition to that I think that is because those kinds of cases are very hard to prosecute.  First and foremost, you do not want to do anything to dissuade a victim of a crime coming forward because they think if they can't get a conviction or ""prove"" the crime happened then they could be ""retaliated"" upon and face charges.  Unfortunately, guilt and conviction don't always go hand in hand.  Secondly, it is very hard to prove someone's intentions.  Yes, sometimes there is evidence that supports a prosecutor's case in regards to intention but it is still tough.  In the case of the exes calling in embezzlement claims, how do you prove an ex made it up vs really thought embezzlement was going on? More so, how do you do that without making an actual victim with little evidence feel like they are the ones being investigated?",1647320934.0,26

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren‚Äôt appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don‚Äôt we spend more time with them, why don‚Äôt we go out more, why don‚Äôt we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don‚Äôt do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven‚Äôt done it yet, I probably won‚Äôt ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal.

Understand this. An accident outdoors is believable and means your family and friends will be sad but nobody thinks of suicide. That is important because if they did, the pain is much worse and goes on for decades.

The risk as you say is remaining alive with a broken body. People do not always die in a fall which makes this a problem.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1021

PS I got a poodle and forget the stupid haircuts, poodles are absolutely awesome. Smart, easy to housetrain, love to go on walks but love to snuggle.

He didn't leave. He didn't give her up for dead. Because his VA benefits were shit, and wouldn't pay for a home health care aide, he was her sole caretaker for the last two years of her life.

When I apologized for calling him (despite hardly knowing him) and cried for feeling bad, and cried that my moms Jewish, so I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm allowed to ask his help, he nicely told me that it didn‚Äôt matter how often I skipped church. Or youth group or if I believed in anything, Old Testament or new. 

That he took the job because he wanted to prove God in the way he was meant to; by being a Good Samaritan and caring about people. And he didn‚Äôt mind losing sleep, because bringing me home safely was what Catholicism is about; doing the right thing. 

He never brought it up again, but when I saw him he would greet me warmly and ask how I was. Even if I was a random kid off the street that didn‚Äôt have a religion really. 

Some people are just called for that kind of work, and don‚Äôt mind living poor and doing good things for no return. They actually practice what they preach.

He didn't name specific sins, it was more that everyone does things they shouldn't do, everyone. No singling out particular groups, no political stuff. If a church tells you anything other than ""We all screw up, we should all try to be better"" then it's not sound theology. Yeah, if I go to a church, I should do my part to keep the lights on, but if they're telling me that I can buy my way out of whatever punishment I definitely deserve (I've done some weird shit) by buying the pastor a Cadillac, I don't go for that.

""Is that a gram?""
""New card. Whaddya think?""
Bateman slides his card across the table; it's off-white, with the words PATRICK BATEMAN: VICE PRESIDENT centred and embossed in black.
The assembled party gasp in admiration.
""Very nice.""
Bateman leans back in his chair.
""Picked 'em up from the printers yesterday.""
""Good colouring.""
""That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Grail.""
Another broker interrupts.
""It's very cool, Bateman, but...""

He whips out his card, laying it next to Bateman's on the table. Off-white with the words ROBERT VAN PATTEN: VICE PRESIDENT centred and embossed in black, it is basically indistinguishable.
""Egg shell, with Roman.""
Bateman smiles bitterly.
""Nice.""
Now a third broker pulls out his card. It looks exactly like the first two, except it reads TIMOTHY BRICE: VICE PRESIDENT.
""Raised lettering, pale nimbus.""
""Impressive"", Bateman mutters. ""Let's see Paul Allen's card.""
The room falls silent as the third broker produces an absent colleague's card.
Bateman speaks in voiceover.

I see a whole bunch of suggestions here, which seem way too premature for the state the game's in. I wouldn't recommend doing anything related to progression, realistic damage, and stuff like that before you figure out the core gameplay loop and make it even more appealing. Progression should come later to complement your gameplay. Lots of other stuff recommended here should come even later.

If you can, I'd love to see a dissolve or rot effect added to the roots as they disappear rather than it just blanking out in chunks. 

Reactions from the humans being smacked would also not go amiss. Some minor stumble or shake, anything to lead credence to there having been an impact.

I don't mind the backhoe exploding as it does, but if you can't destroy the stone building in one pass you shouldn't be able to walk through it doing passive damage. You should bounce off, while doing damage to the structure at that point. With smacks or stomps doing damage in an AoE in front of you by comparison.

And yes, as other people pointed out, if the humans can take more than one hit, the equipment should be a bit tougher too unless you have some kind of special ability to entangle them with roots. Nature beats jenga tower technology after all.",1647314195.0,1

Thoughts:

*End of level, main character plants itself into ground and blooms, grows leaves. The less damage you took, the greater the bloom.  

*collect bird nests and small animals (eg squirrels) as bonuses. They can help you fight.

*weather effects? Wind, snow, rain, lightning. 

*have a move where you can plant your roots deep. It limits movement, exposing you to danger, but allows for unique powerful attacks. 

*Maybe a stealth level where you can hide motionless until humans pass? 

*I‚Äôd love to see some unique environment interactions like walking through electrical wires and they break and drop with sparks, crossing a busy road and cars are swerving out of the way, jumping in a river (floating?)

*Finale in a giant lumbar mill with huge saws, wood chippers, and the like. Basically a horror movie for trees. Maybe the player has to free all the trees about to get cut up?",1647312559.0,1

The concept is very cool, but you can probably see how it could feel pretty lethargic to play. Movement speed is very low. It's fine for the identity of the player but if they have to traverse long sections it will become frustrating. The swing of the hand is very unsatisfying. The acceleration curve could use some tweaking to make the peak speed of the attack faster. You also more or less must add more screen shake and extra effects like bright flashes to make it more juicy.

> I'm currently still playing with the level of destruction per element. But I'll take your feedback into account, thank you once again! :)

I used to work as a welder repairing heavy equipment. Excavators like that are massively overbuilt which is why they move so slow and why they need caterpillar tracks to support their weight. The boom arm is usually 3/8- 1/2 (13mm) thick steel plate of very high strength steel, premium quality stuff. It's a pain to weld because you have to preheat it to prevent the welds from cracking if they cool too quickly, because the structure is so rigid. Operators abuse the hell out of those things so they make them literally bulletproof. Can be up to 50mm/2"" around the pivot pins. Operators sometimes use the arm to drag the entire weight of the machine up a muddy slope. They're also of course rigorously designed not to catch on fire. You can guarantee somone somehere has unintentionally gone out of their way to try setting them on fire. See-Murphys Law.

So I feel like the best tactic in this scenario would be to flip the machine on it's side, or else attack the cab side and come at the driver, ""I am groot"" style. It's not just going to blow away in the breeze. You could just trigger a cracked glass image and some blood spatter on the windows. 

Probably one of the few objects in game that's should be deliberately non destructible. 

Another fun game mechanic might be keeping other creepers from climbing up into the cab and starting it up again. I'm envisioning a boss-fight scenario here where you play king of the hill.

Squirrels are omnivores, but the best thing for him to keep going in the winter are nuts. Not sure that prezels, with tons of salt are very good for him.

They arent meant to keep inside. Only time thats ok is for rehabilitation or rescue of an injured animal. They are meant to be wild. 

I love animals and the best way to show that, is to let wild animals remain wild and enjoy them in their natural habitat. 

FYI: Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other forms of direct contact with infected squirrels. Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid. Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease, Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. - googled information.",1647282736.0,9

I remember when Fiona Apple's ""Shameika"" won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance, and people were up in arms about it not really being Rock.  I really like the song.

If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

I was in the production office at Butler Square, across from the Target Center arena, for the 1994 Earth Day concert in Minneapolis, and getting ready to go up the elevator.  Behind me were a couple of girls... When the elevator doors opened, it was Steve and it turns out the two girls were his nieces who drove over from Wisconsin (where he was born).

He basically came across exactly like any typical uncle talks to their nieces and nephews... not a rock star.  Just a sort of ""hey that's our uncle and he's in this band"" kind of guy.  Very folksy, laid back, middle America kind of guy.

I think Lennon summed it up best:

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that.

It's possible for Dolly, and even a Britney Spears, if they get a fresh new crew. Honestly, I'd only trust Madonna to manage teams for older stars, as odd as that is to say. She's has the best track record and longevity and an uncanny ear for the next new sound under her belt. She can hear or see something totally new and just know how it will work.

Dolly re-did Old Flames beautifully with Keshsa on her ""I'm a real artist"" album. Jack White blew his pud on Loretta Lynn. I would suggest someone who still has a fight in their belly.

However, Downtown Houston and particularly Downtown Dallas both have pretty good walking scores. Downtown Dallas was a bunch of deserted office skyscrapers when I lived there but I hear it has gotten better.

EDIT: Since people are getting confused, Houston and Dallas being ranked 24th and 26th walkability score of large American cities is a VERY BAD ranking. The website is saying that Dallas and Houston are car dependent and UNWALKABLE. So everyone replying saying, ""That website is wrong! Houston and Dallas are terrible to walk!"" Yes, that's exactly what the website is also saying.

The crime in that place is insane too. Just assume your car is going to get broken into on the regular in most neighborhoods.

Then it's 100¬∞+ in the shade everyday for like 5 months. They get a winter now though for maybe a month which they are still not prepared; no infrastructure really and stores don't stock much for ice removal or anything like that. 

During the freeze last year we were standing in line to cut up untreated lumber to burn, for the few that could skid down the road to the lowes. I think we were out of propane too. I found one small tank and used a blow torch to defrost drain pipes. You have to drip faucets all winter so they don't freeze but during the power outage, that froze up the drains. 

Anyway, we're closing on our house there soon hopefully and already left for good. The power outage and the following pipe bursts was the final straw on an already broken back. 

Fuck Dallas and most of Texas and the whole Texas State government and US Congress idiots. They get what they voted for now. Good luck.

My experience with transit has varied based on where I have lived, but I've always been within walking distance of a grocery store. I specifically have chosen where to live based on proximity to a grocery store and access to transit, and it's not necessarily expensive. In 2017-18 I was in fort worth walking distance from a grocery store and transit hub, and 2018-2021 I was in Houston near a variety of frequent bus routes and walking distance to a grocery store, as well as multiple restaurants and shops. My rent in fort worth was $699 and in Houston $799, both for a one bedroom between 600-800 square feet. 

But I have also always explicitly made the choice for those amenities. Back in 2017 I specifically sought out a work from home job, and have been working from home ever since. I always check transit access for places I'm moving to, and make sure that the transit connects to where I'd want to go for things like recreation, errands, and shopping. I got a folding bike in order to be able to easily take my bike on trains and extend the area I could easily access from transit. I make very frequent trips to the grocery store, about 2-3 times per week, each trip usually being about 30 minutes round trip if I'm dallying, since I have to carry everything home myself. I accept that trips themselves take longer and plan accordingly (though I have way more usable time than if I drove everywhere). 

I know not everyone could live my lifestyle, or even want to. I know my experience is not the norm. But I wanted a car free lifestyle while still living in Texas cities. I've been able to achieve that and am very content with my lifestyle.",1647317729.0,2

Texas is huge. And most people in Texas likes to think that their slice of Texas is the best version of Texas, from Austin to hill country to ranch towns in west Texas. Which means every Texan outside of [insert Texan city] can't agree on who's best, but they can agree to throw shade on that city (unless they're actually from that city).

My take: Dallas represents Texas just fine. It's a huge metro with great variety and diversity inside it. And yes: it's sprawling.

They would rent out consoles, and if you asked and they had spare, you could buy a used one. that thing never quit on me. It introduced me to a whole new world of RPGs. Legend of Dragoon is a fond one, Parasite Eve was scary for me. 

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

I earned my S class rating in Grand Turismo.

Here are a few of the reasons for that feeling:

- the sweater pattern is mechanical and all aligned, which wouldn't be the case on a real sweater

- the sweater and shirt both feel composited in, and the shirt is both in and out of focus

- focus drifts and disagrees at different points: for example, her ear (and neck) is out of focus but the hair in front of and behind her ear are both in focus

- the coloration of her face is splotchy and transitions abruptly from olive to rosy and back again",1647258472.0,56

Remini has already been discussed, but I am unfamiliar with it (I imagine it's similar to DFDNet). Recently with stylegan2 some interesting ideas have been implemented. One with particular promise is time-travel re-photography in which the latent space is queried for a similar looking face to the input image, and then the AI face is converged toward the input image.  

[AI Comparisons of this face](https://i.imgur.com/W6bUmq0.jpg)   

I would say the GFPGAN output actually produces a really believable result and better represents that age of the subject (I think there is a decade of difference across these photos).

One thing I would consider working on is the background and levels. The thing that has the most artificial impression overall is the background fading into black in the lower left of the picture, because it contrasts with her very colorful cheeck which is receiving light from that area. its much brighter in the original source. I can see the stylistic choice you might have made for a portrait shot, but it might require darkening the cheek just a litte bit. very fine hair on the cheek receiving backlight to add a smooth fade for the silhouette might help sell it even more.",1647260480.0,1

However, I think that it is important to colorize photos, especially in a historical sense. Most people's historical reference point starts with their birth. When they see a b&w photo of say Ruby Bridges as a child being escorted, the technology to produce the original photo gives it an ancient, 'so long ago' reference. When viewing the same photo of Ruby Bridges being escorted, but this time in color, gives the photo the right historical framework as in 'not that long ago'.

1. It looks like there is a curl of her hair in the original that has been removed/confused with background plant life - would be good to add that back in as it looks a bit too clean on that side
2. As a result of this, the 'indent' around the outside corner of her right eye is also absent, giving it a less naturally rounded appearance. As a result it looks like her cheek is basically in line with her brow/forehead rather than curving in at the top.

I see that her sweater is green.  Was that an educated guess?  Was it computer-assisted? There used to be a bot here on reddit that did a really good job (by machine learning standards) colorizing b/w images. 

There is a colorized image of our fire department from the 1920s in my local bank that drives me nuts. Whoever colorized it made the New Jersey flag red instead of yellow. Although, it's also clear that it was done before modern computer tools.

1. Fix any photo damage and over exposed areas.
2. Expand the image for better composition and fill out the areas that need to be. I did that in this case but ended up replacing the entire background anyway coz there was barely anything there.
3. Remove noise as much as possible while trying not to wash out information in order to be able to used later.
4. Spend hours trying to find the closest high quality replacement from stock photos for all the facial features / skin / hair / and other stuff in the photo.
5. Spend more time trying to morph and blend them all to match with the original as much as possible. Improvise when there's no information. Spend a lot of time on this step because the more accurate you can make it, the better the final result will be.
6. Do a base color coating on the entire image.
7. Study the materials in the image and try to overpaint on all of them trying to replicate the material effects -- glossiness, refraction, reflections, specular detail, subsurface scattering for the skin and transparent materials and etc. The more time spent on this, the more realistic the final image will be.
8. Add noise and some intentional photo distortion to make it look like a photo and less like an overpainted image
9. Get lazy after all that work and find hackjobs for less important areas coz it can get tiring.
10. Do a final color grade / lighting fix / overpaint to fix anything that stands out too much.
11. Save and post to reddit.

Here's a WIP GIF of another restoration I did a while ago. This is not the same kind of restoration work as the OP ..but it does kind of outline my process a bit. This one is missing an entire overpaint layer that I now do for skin and etc. [https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4)

Obviously we have more choices and ways of imparting colors, but people regularly wore colorful clothing in the past too, all over the world. And decorated their surroundings in bright colors. Black and white photos are great, because the alternative is almost entirely either nothing, or portraits of the rich. The portraits do show us the colors they had available, but they are biased because they're being paid for, and they create bias in us because the only color we see is worn by the aristocracy.

People have this idea that it was all dark and dreary and colorless. That everyone was perpetually depressed and bitter and everything was hopeless.

Oddly enough media depicting ancient history often is more colorful and bright, and there is a far greater spectrum ‚Äòlife‚Äô happening. It‚Äôs not until the middle ages that things are just‚Ä¶monochromatic.

Fantasy novels especially fall victim to this narrative. This dark and dreary monochrome world where everything is just glum and horrible.

War, disease, famine, and tough times have always been a part of human history, and still are, and will continue to be. That never stopped people from trying to enjoy themselves and trying to find happiness, laughter, hope, and fulfillment in their respective time periods.",1647274048.0,3

The change in my world from 0-10 may have been incredible from a scientific view, or an outsider's view...but for me, it goes from being a kid, to still being a kid..  From 10-20, though, enough personal change happens that it could easily be broken into multiple time/emotional groups.  From 20's on out...my views have changed, my circumstances have changed, my lifestyle has changed...but in perspective, I still feel the same person.  So time doesn't feel as impactful.

So things that happened 10 years ago to me, feel very much like they could have only happened last year.  The passing of time just doesn't hit as strongly.  There is little difference from one year to another.  (Taking out huge milestones like the pandemic, 9/11, etc...just considering day to day events)

But as a kid, each year or two years brought about a lot more change.  So time and individual time periods had greater impact.  So that is my perspective on passing time, where I felt it having more of an impact in my life.  During that time, 50 years prior was the 1930's.  Intellectually, I know that is now nearly 100 years ago...but emotionally, it still feels that same 50 yr period as it did when I was coming to terms with life and everything about it.

Time is definitely relative.  And perception becomes one's reality.",1647266035.0,10

Even a 10 yr span today is pretty much nothing to me, yet it is 20-25% of my life.  But to 20-yr old me, that's the difference of being 15-16 to 20.

At 15, I was just some little dweeb who could hardly interact with society and didn't even know how to talk to a girl, but me at 20...ok, maybe not the best example.  lol",1647268495.0,3

""The oligarchs"" are not a political force in Russia, it would seem. I'm not even sure the generals in the military could be if they wanted, though they would certainly have more pull than some billionaire who owes his business license to Putin.

Its not something you build once and then just plop it into the ground for a few years an expect it to still work.
Given what shit show we are seeing now, if an order was given:

1) How many people would follow it?

2) Of those that did how many missiles would launch vs just sit there doing nothing?

3) Of those that attempted to launch, how many would blow up in the tubes?

4) Of those that cleared the tubes how many would make orbit?

5) Of those that made orbit how many would track to the actual target?

6) Of those that start tracking to target how many would get through the missile shields?

7) Of those that made it through the shields, how many would properly detonate?


Not saying these are things that we really want to test.... But its probably a very different situation than it would have been at the height of the cold war when these things were new, and ""may"" have actually been maintained to some degree.

The US spends ~35B/year on nuclear maintenance and readiness (this is NOT the big money upgrades that keep getting put off, this is just keeping the cobwebs dusted off). Russia's 2021 budget set aside ~400M for ""upgrades"" to their nuclear force....  who the hell knows the allocations for maintenance (total Russian defense budget is like 60B/year for background).

Let's assume that 95% of their treaty limited arsenal of 1,500 intercontinental warheads is technically useless or gets intercepted by missile defenses. 

The remaining 5% would only be enough to obliterate New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Washington and about 50 to 75 other cities/targets in the US and Western Europe. 

On the assumption that none of those warheads accidentally hits a nuclear power station (after all we wouldn't want a few of them exploding and adding the contents of their reactors and storage pools to the environment), that the Russians stockpile of  tactical/battlefield nukes are also completely unusable and that the US/Europe doesn't retaliate with a full strike, obliterating and irradiating most of Russia (and a lot of neighboring countries) I think it's a cost worth paying to call Putin's bluff.

Putin has got his hands dirty on multiple occasions over the past 10 years - he doesn't just make idle threats.

Regardless of the state of the Russian nuclear arsenal you can be pretty damn sure that some of those missiles will get through. 

Maybe it wouldn't be a complete apocalypse (in the West), but tell that to the millions of dead people London, New York, Washington, Paris, Berlin and all the other major US and European cities that no doubt have multiple Russian warheads targeted at them. 

Tell that to all the Russians who will undoubtedly die when the US/Europeans retaliate with a full strike (which will probably be triggered automatically if the Russians even look like they are going ballistic).

Tell that to the billions who will then probably die as a result of a global collapse in supply chains, potential nuclear winter and nuclear fallout.

*  We know Putin has a track record of following through with threats
*  We know Putin is in his 70's (he is already older than the average life expectancy of most Russian men)
*  We know that Putin is increasingly paranoid
*  We know that Putin will do anything to 'restore Russian pride' and has a hard-on for taking the US down a peg or two.

You really want to fucking gamble that Putin will not start a nuclear war at the potential cost of a completely fucked up world?

Maybe 75% of his nukes will malfunction, maybe some of the 'yes-men' he has put in place over the past 20 years will grow some balls and not go along with the plan, maybe God will save us - who the fuck knows, but I would certainly not be willing to gamble millions/potentially billions of lives when Russia will probably self-destruct on its own shortly anyway.

These systems are not designed to counter a large-scale attack with hundreds of IBCMs.

>In a rushed effort completed by 2004, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system began with 30 interceptor missiles in underground silos: 26 at Fort Greely in Alaska and four more at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

>The Obama administration added 14 more interceptor missiles at Fort Greely in 2017. Two years later the Trump administration started the process of adding 20 more missiles there with upgraded technology and the first are scheduled to be deployed by 2028.

So that's 44 missiles. Even if they all work as intended, they'll only take out a fraction of Russia's arsenal.

>Official Pentagon policy states that its system is only designed to protect the nation from nuclear missiles fired by a rogue state like North Korea. For a military superpower like Russia, the US depends on its own vast nuclear arsenal of about 5,400 warheads as a deterrent. 

>The US must depend on nuclear deterrence because the arithmetic of our limited missile defense system and Russia‚Äôs massive arsenal doesn‚Äôt add up, said Robert Soofer, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy during the Trump administration. Russia can overwhelm the US system by launching many more nuclear missiles than it could possibly knock out with its small squadron of ground-based interceptors.

>‚ÄúThere are ways that Russia can strike the United States that really makes the GBI system virtually useless,‚Äù said Soofer, a nonresident senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank. ‚ÄúIf Russia wants to penetrate US missile defenses, they can.‚Äù

additionally anti-cruise and ballistic missile capability is much harder than you‚Äôd think.  short range interceptors, ie thaad systems and iron dome interceptors, are much too short range and payloads can still seriously affect target areas.  medium and long range interceptors (abms) have hit rates varying between 50-70% in tests.  meaning we‚Äôve gotta fire 4 for every 1 missile to guarantee disabling it.  we don‚Äôt have that many abms, especially considering mixing in non nuclear payloads in a strike.

They're only located at Vandenberg AFB in California and Fort Greely in Alaska, and have a total of 30 interceptors. The system was never meant to fend off a Russian mass attack.

There are some supplemental systems such as some ships carrying anti-ballistic missile versions of the SM-2/SM-3/SM-6 missile, but they cover very limited ranges, requiring the ships to be close to the flight path. They generally won't protect very far inland, or even some coastal cities, because Russian missiles would mostly come over the North Pole.

In short, we'd be lucky to knock down a couple dozen warheads out of the 1985 on 466 ballistic missiles they have. (Caveat: Not all of the SLBMs will launch, as inevitably, at least a couple of subs won't be in sailable condition even in a surge.)",1647316029.0,2

However, money that goes into weapons to defend themselves against egotistical madmen is also money that could've gone into medical or educational budgets. I don't blame anyone for suddenly wanting to do it, as we have all realized peace is far more fragile than we have assumed. I blame the bald demagogue on Russia who wanted his name on history books as a russian unifier.

For instance, one laptop could have a 2TB image, while that image only has 250Gb of data and 240GB of it is system files. And I frequently work with single email accounts that are larger than 34GB. And seeing that it was a whole mail server under 34GB, that leads me to believe it's either very old, or it's not actually an image of a whole mail server and only a few targeted accounts from it. (But is named to appear to be a whole image, which has yet to be confirmed/verified content-wise.)

In fact, there's a very good chance that what they obtained was the data related to a single legal hold that was being handled in relation to a lawsuit and discovery request. I say this, because I've handled dozens of scenarios where the source data is pretty much exactly like this from a client. Also seeing that most of the archives and collections were made and stored here around the same time period (September 2019 through February 2020) it's very clear this was actually being compiled for a reason.

Some backups will be corrupt.  Some will be too old.  Some will have incompatible versions for talking to the other things it needs to talk to and on and on and on.  

Everyone backs up the VM images but backing up the VM machine itself and all it's custom config along with the storage arrays are easily forgotten, not automated, and likely outdated.

They fester this attitude so that fewer people are likely to even bother looking at the truth, which limits its spread. If people refuse, as a culture, as a society, to acknowledge the truth because they think it has no value then the truth dies. And propaganda, totalitarians, etc know this, they intentionally spread the lie that the well of truth has dried up so that no one goes to it.

Here‚Äôs the thing, anyone that is truly paying attention already knows the overall answers. Everyone in my life that follows politics and has for many years connected the dots and will hardly talk about it now or unplugged completely because it‚Äôs too fucked up to deal with and no one who can do anything is doing anything, not even calling it out.I mean plenty of academics, sociologists, political scientists have called it out but no one with enough power to fix anything has stood us and said the plain truth: 

*America we‚Äôve were compromised by Russian operatives and assets and for four years they had the keys to the kingdom and of we don‚Äôt stop it we will collapse.*

So the thing is, if we saw it all together, in writing, with  undeniable proof, would we do something  or just go back to Netflix? Shouldn‚Äôt the Panama papers have started a world wide rebellion? 

My extremely educated uncle mentioned the other week how so many of the biggest mouthpieces have been outted as fascists that want to install a dictatorship and work with Russia like it was the first time he said it out loud. I looked at him and said ‚Äúyeah we and our kids are going  to have to kick ass( our kids are adults) and he just looked at the ground and said ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs too late‚Äù. There were probably 7 or 8 highly political people in the room (family funeral) and not one person said a word. That moment scared me more than any other so far. Even my young adult nephews that have masters in history just stared ahead. 

Are we too tired, too afraid, too beaten down? Are we just so demoralized by 50+ years of fighting in good faith with people that not only aren‚Äôt using good faith they use every dirty trick in the world to put on a pretend play while literally driving their supporters into madness.

No.

Those sites are just a way to make advertising revenue off of people's ignorance.

People get a ""Cannot find Entry Point..."" error and lock onto the dll and figure ""ahh! Of course, I can just replace it with a newer version!"" they do a google search, land on dll-files.com or whatever, and oh, good! there are 20 different versions of gdi32.dll (why the FUCK do they have that file at all?). Well, they pick one and then they go down the rabbit hole of forcibly replacing gdi32.dll on their computer and make it unbootable. 

or, taking the old game example, maybe the error is that mvscr90.dll cannot be found.

So a user google searches and oh look, lost-dll-files.com and dll-files-for-less.com and dll-files.com and free-dll-files.net and who knows who else has it for free download! Surely,  that is the solution right?

No. The ""solution"" is to install the Visual C++ 2008 redistributable.

or maybe the error is that ""mfc42u.dll"" could not be found. Same story. Except you need the Visual C++ 6.0 redistributable.

Hell, just looking into that specific game and I'm finding shitloads of bad advice. Dinput.dll missing? oh, here, download this random fucking zip file and extract it.

Like, no. Just install DirectX 9.0c.

Mike Pence could very well have been the next link in the Reagan - GHWB - GWB chain that masks the right's evil under the veil of boring legitimacy, while slowly chipping away at our rights.

Trump basically stole their plausible deniability. He took all the racism and ignorance that was always there, but neatly tucked away, and put it center stage.

Eventually it becomes hard to get public support for expanding the infrastructure protecting people, then it gets harder to get support for maintaining the infrastructure, then things start breaking and the dangers everything was set up to protect people from re-emerge.

Eventually, humanity returns to its base state, racked with disease, starving from famine, slogging through the mud killing each other over whose god is stronger.

They don't ask for recognizably dangerous information until after forming a relationship with you based on that initial foot in the door - they wait until you're so deep in it that they could nuke you completely if you stopped cooperating.

I do have more hope than I shared, I was basically just venting my deepest worries that keep me awake but I stay off social media for a month at a time and focus on my actual life, local things I can help with and supporting the movements I hope are strong and good and I feel okay most of the time. 

What you said is important and maybe exactly right. If y‚Äôall want to fight, I‚Äôm here for it. I‚Äôd happily go out fighting fascists, the one thing they have never been able to take is the humanity we have and they lack and they know it‚Äôs something they want to destroy but can‚Äôt even identify. I can live with this ending even if we lose but the idea that we just sit and get absorbed into the fray is the most depressing thought I‚Äôve ever had. Seriously. Nothing is more depressing than humanity just rolling over. 


This conversation makes me think of one of the funniest books I‚Äôve ever read, written by Mikhail Bulgakov while he was living in Stalin‚Äôs Soviet Union (his wife was able to only publish it 25 years after his death) , people think these people we deal with can‚Äôt be evil because they are stupid and they do and say ridiculous things but Mikhail said all fascism is that way. The book reads a bit like a dark Alice in Wonderland but Alice is Satan and also Stalin and his sidekick is a humongous talking cat.

I guess I‚Äôm these times we have a threat we‚Äôve never had before, the end of the earth as a life planet. But we don‚Äôt really know that either. Something could be invented anyway that absolutely changes the game.

Remember how the war protests when we were young popped up like they had a sentient life of their own? How about BLM literally exploding across the globe seemingly overnight? I used to volunteer for Obama both terms and I swear we were all working out there, sweating and taking abuse but I worked Biden‚Äôs campaign from behind  the computer because I didn‚Äôt care - I wanted trump gone. And it was like I was all alone, not like the Obama days when I‚Äôd see people and meet them. I felt like everyone just gave up. Then the numbers came in and I remembered how the left are like ducks -they coast alone like the right can just snatch us up and under water we‚Äôre scrambling  for ourselves, our children. That‚Äôs why we literally OWN grassroots movements and they can‚Äôt ever figure it out. We might disagree with each other about stupid shit but the humanity we fight for is the same in each of us. The right fight for selfish, bullshit and they all have their own agendas in the end .


I wanted a Bernie too. I wanted someone to speak for us and show the heartless sociopaths that they have to go now. But maybe that‚Äôs not the way it goes, maybe life is about the struggle to have good over evil and maybe we don‚Äôt ever win the big war but we have thousands of years of history proving humanity always prevails. I don‚Äôt mean to dismiss atrocities here, just to point out that now matter what they‚Äôve throw at us progress has always been had anyway. 

I spend weeks away from politics 3 or 4, then I‚Äôll come around online and see what I missed. I‚Äôll read the headlines like Reuters to keep up with big things like the war but the rest of the time I unplug, heal and remember the good things and good people. 

We‚Äôre sad because it‚Äôs SAD that humanity can‚Äôt get it together and we should be sad because otherwise we‚Äôre one of them. But remember the art and humor and how awesome the youth that fight for progress are. How luck we are to see the most progressives time in history and maybe we had it kinda easy because we were too young to have marched for civil rights and the gay rights fight was tough but a lot less bloody and horrifying. 

Remember when our parents would sigh and give up and say the world wasn‚Äôt the same anymore? We‚Äôre them when we let it get to us, let‚Äôs be the awesome older people that would sneak in weed to concerts at 55,55,65.

9131,worldnews,"Anonymous hackers hit Russian oil giant Rosneft, secure 20TB of data",MorgrainX,1647289850.0,1967,67860,0.93,"Well, sort of. I used to work at Chevron (the company cultures of all these places is roughly similar). First of all, it is highly competitive because, despite the bad rap, there are a lot of people who want to work for the energy industry because it pays really well. The problems you are solving - strategic, operational, financial, mechanical, scientific - are all extremely complicated and difficult. So there is a limit to how far brown nosing can get you if you don‚Äôt have baseline intellectual chops or sales skills if you‚Äôre on the business development side. At the end of the day, oil is a commodity, so whatever company can develop the cheapest, most efficient methods for extraction, refinement, and logistics (eg ‚Äòpackaging‚Äô and transporting and building pipelines for delivery) is going to be able to sell more oil contracts.

Anyway, point is - yes, there are times when so and so gets promoted when you feel someone else is more competent at their job. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the person promoted is incompetent. In my 7 years at the company, I did not once see someone promoted who was incompetent (partially because if you are incompetent you will be fired real quick ‚Äî too many other people waiting in line for your job). Also, what some people mistake as office politics are sometimes mismatches between slots in the job hierarchy. For example, I honestly was the best operations engineer in my group when I was there. But I did not get promoted to senior because that was a managerial role and, let‚Äôs be honest, I was simply not going to be as good of a manager as the woman who got promoted. 

Anyway, so there really are some places where, yes office politics are involved in promotions, but the nature of the work is such that you will look like a fool if you promote someone who causes problems because they don‚Äôt actually do anything to produce more value for the company. You have limited promotions you can give each year, so you really need to choose them wisely if you yourself want to keep your job.",1647313152.0,8

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90‚Äôs.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

And just look at The Fellowship of the Ring! That is a gory ass movie. Had the Orcs and Goblins been humans it would've been a hard R, but because they're fantasy creatures that bleed black it could be PG-13.",1647311622.0,58

Last year my brother and I watched the same movie in the same theater.  Everyone was super tense and quiet.  A girl and her date noped out at the beginning of the second act right about the time the sister starts calling out the cards.

This time, the crowd was way more into the comedic timing of it and was laughing at how serious the characters were treating the over the top absurdity of it.

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,22

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

WRONG...

EDIT:

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

They know next to nothing as a rule about their own history, or the histories of other nations, or the histories of the various social movements that have risen and fallen in the past, and they certainly know little or nothing of the complexities and contradictions comprised within words like ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and ‚Äúcapitalism.‚Äù Chiefly, what they have been trained not to know or even suspect is that, in many ways, they enjoy far fewer freedoms, and suffer under a more intrusive centralized state, than do the citizens of countries with more vigorous social-democratic institutions. This is at once the most comic and most tragic aspect of the excitable alarm that talk of social democracy or democratic socialism can elicit on these shores.

>An enormous number of Americans have been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than, say, Germans or Danes precisely because they possess far fewer freedoms in the concrete. They are far more vulnerable to medical and financial crisis, far more likely to receive inadequate health coverage, far more prone to irreparable insolvency, far more unprotected against predatory creditors, far more subject to income inequality, and so forth, while effectively paying more in tax (when one figures in federal, state, local, and sales taxes, and then compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country, as almost nowhere else, their taxes do not cover). One might think that a people who once rebelled against the mightiest empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services. But we accept what we have become used to, I suppose. Even so, one has to ask, what state apparatus in the ‚Äúfree‚Äù world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens while providing no substantial civic benefits in return, solely in order to enrich a piratically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the immensely wealthy?

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,65

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

I've got a friend, initials DID, who grew up in a trailer park to first gen Trinidadian immigrant parents who speak with heavy accents, so zero privilege. In 5th grade, DID's teacher thinks he's pretty smart and he should do an international baccalaureate (IB) preparedness program at a magnet middle school (harder middle school classes to prepare for harder high school classes). DID convinced his parents to sign the forms, which they only do because the school is a magnet program so he'll be added to a bus route and they won't have to take him to the miles further away middle school.  
  
During 8th grade, DID does all the paperwork himself to get into magnet high school with the IB program. DID excels in the IB program and gets into the nearby state university (now a top 10 public university) on a variety of scholarships and grants, which he researched and applied for all by himself. Never received any financial help from any family members.  
  
At the University, DID meets eventual wife, who is premed. Travels around the country with her for med school and residency. Works at several advertising firms along the way. After residency, moves to Jacksonville, FL where wife takes job at one of the hospitals and DID founds his own online advertising firm. Now DID makes like $300k/year and his Dr wife makes more and they live in a huge house like 6 blocks from the beach.  
  
That covers the work ethic and up by his bootstraps point. Now the natural intelligence.  
  
DID has 4 siblings. They're all short sighted, immediate gratitude, poor decision making, in their 40s and still working menial jobs BUT as far as I know (known DID since 6th grade) not on drugs or with criminal records (so it isn't like they got into the system early and had additional barriers). The only one who doesn't live in a trailer park near the parents, check to check, is one sister who married her HS boyfriend who eventually became a Ford dealership manager after working there like 20 years and lives a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  
  
Those 5 people grew up in the same home, all born in the USA, none had noticeable accents, and all went to the same schools outside of DID choosing basically on his own to go to the two magnet programs. All of his siblings suffer from dumb people issues like lack of logic and inability to prepare for the future. The only explanation is DID being naturally smarter than his siblings.",1647305935.0,-1

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure. I say a ""dash"" because the results aren't weighted by population or anything - the Scandinavian countries each count just as much as the UK in the analysis, even though their combined population is less than half of the UK's and they have vastly simpler political structures and internal administrative challenges.",1647306813.0,32

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems?

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,7

The process is called 'priming.' People are more likely to pick something they feel they are familiar with even if they don't remember how or why they became familiar with it in the first place. It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high. Information for whatever reason tends to lose context in memory and all that's left after a while is just the impression. It doesn't matter much where that impression came from.

The other study sucked, for obvious reasons which I explained at length. It's not my fault that the first study was so poorly done, nor that the second study is over two decades old. That's historical data at this point, not a current representation of either the US or Germany's status in 2022.

This last article you linked to (Stockhausen) is the only decent one among the three. It seems to analyze relevant data, although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. It's not nothing, but it's also not very much in absolute terms.

Oddly, the abstract claims that, ""while the majority of German males has been able to share in the country‚Äôs rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground."" However, this is directly contradicted by the results themselves, which clearly indicate that well over half of American men earn more than their fathers. The majority of both American and German men are doing better than their fathers.

 Notably, this study does not evaluate the amount of improvement per individual (i.e. only the number of people who earn more, not how much more they earn), nor does it address the downward mobility included in the original study which started this thread.

It didn‚Äôt. Your reasons were bad.

Income mobility is, by definition, a measure of parent to child. It must, therefore, span many decades. Generally at least 5 decades, often 6- enough time for the parents earnings to be captured over time, to start. Then for the child to become an adult, and then that adult child to now have a long period of adult earnings to be averaged over time and compared to the averaged over time earnings of the parent.

And it must have good data about both parent, and child, and they must be comparable.

Can you think of Any reason, any at all, why they would predominant use the data of fathers‚Ä¶ from 50-60 years ago?

And not mothers? In the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs? Any reason at all that data about women‚Äôs the earnings, in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, might not be great for analysis of societal income mobility?


>nor that the second study is over two decades old. 

Again, these studies must, by definition, span close to half a century. There is no evidence that these types of massive country level trends change quickly.

>although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). 

Does it?

Really?

Give this a good think.

>The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. 

That‚Äôs a huge difference.

That also means 40% earn less. Vs 33%.

Swinging 7% of the population from going down to going up means that the amount of income from that 7% is ripped from the hands of the Very top tiers- it can come from nowhere else- and redistributed to the working class.

That‚Äôs an enormous amount of overall income / GDP that is more evenly distributed to citizens.

If you think it‚Äôs so little, then let‚Äôs have the US copy Germany‚Äôs much higher taxes and social welfare policies, to drive exactly that outcome.

There is already evidence that light exposure during daytime increases heart rate via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which kicks your heart into high gear and heightens alertness to meet the challenges of the day. 

‚ÄúOur results indicate that a similar effect is also present when exposure to light occurs during nighttime sleep,‚Äù Zee said.

Yes, that is the main way it is regulated.

Transient activation of p53 triggers blockage of the cell cycle, extended activation triggers apoptosis (regulated cell death). So by default it should definitely not be stable and active. You just ideally want it to become stable and active in cancer cells, to stop them dividing and hopefully make them die (though many of them are resistant to apoptosis in other ways).

There does appear to be one evolutionary optimization that we're lacking - elephants have many copies of their p53 gene, so it's much less likely for pre-cancerous cells to lose them.",1647299640.0,2

Worked for AOL for a brief time in the late '90s (it was terrible, the company had no ethics at all, but that's not the story here).

Accounts would get TOS violations, and sent to CAT (the Community Action Team) for a strike or block, which was either education, if it was a first or infrequent issue, up to account termination if it was egregious or frequent. 

However with celebrity accounts, even when they'd get a CAT strike or block, they wouldn't deal with CAT, but could still call the VIP team and get the block or strike removed, basically no questions asked.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

US and NATO pilots tend to have an average of 200 flight hours per year, while Russian pilots only get somewhere between 60-100. The US and NATO pilots use that extra flight time to train on stuff like SEAD.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

He became legendary as Razor Ramon in WWF and continued to be successful in WCW as a founding member of the NWO.

But then after his life started to spiral out of control. He was known for showing up completely wasted an indie shows. Pretty much every wrestling fan considered him a lost cause.

But somehow, with the help of fellow legend Diamond Dallas Page, Hall was able to turn his life around and finally gave us insight into how great of a mind he had for wrestling. I always wished to see his return as a manager or trainer. So sad to see him go; wish he‚Äôd been around more but he could‚Äôve left us much earlier.

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279012.0,39

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead. That knowledge, that I would take someone else's life, even in self defense, has permanently fucked up my mind. I thought I was a pacifist. I never knew how I would feel or what decisions I would make until I was in that situation. But now I know and I can't unknow it anymore. I never know how to describe how disturbing that knowledge is, how it fucks with your head in a specific way that is hard to describe. Your friend is living with something even heavier.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die. 

Killing a person in self defense, to protect yourself. You're not responsible for being in that situation, you're just trying to find a way out. It being justifiable is no solace for the conscience.",1647282578.0,48

While I can't speak to your very specific and extremely traumatizing experience, I just wanted to share the perspective that pacifism and the right to defend yourself against the aggression of others are not at all at odds with each other.

I'm not religious myself, but **even Jesus** told people that nobody could be expected to just sit there and take any kind of treatment. He said, ""If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men."" To me, those provisos were his way saying, ""Be nice to people, but if someone comes around looking for a fight, that's on them, not on you.""

And as far as the ""turn the other cheek"" concept, I like this interpretation:

>At the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to be of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and dominance. If the persecuted person ""turned the other cheek,"" the discipliner was faced with a dilemma: The left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was demanding equality.

>Wink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10‚Äì13). By giving the lender the cloak as well, the debtor was reduced to nakedness. Wink notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, and not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20‚Äì23).

>Wink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions.[3] In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law, as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law.[4]",1647301393.0,2

I'm a bit of a rambler but I'll do my best to keep it concise, but there was a lot going on all at once. 

I had moved in with my then boyfriend of two years (now husband) and our roommate (best friend of husband, close friend of mine). We lived in a 340 sqft studio apartment (yes, that's a really small apartment for three people! It was supposed to be temporary while we looked for a 2 bedroom apartment) in one of those old apartments where they just stacked some studios on top of each other in concrete squares. We lived in the biggest city in the state and studios were the cheapest living, especially split three ways. It was the kind of place where when we heard scratches in the walls, we just assumed rats because well, its a shitty old apartment. 

On February 17th, we were woken up to a knocking sound coming from upstairs, like someone was aggressively putting together IKEA furniture. It woke my boyfriend and I up, and I just covered my head with my pillow. We had heard noises late at night from him so we just always assumed he worked night shift. Well this night, the banging noises didn't stop, and went on throughout the day until 1PM. 

At 8AM, my boyfriend got out of bed, and went to work. Our upstairs neighbor ran down the stairs, chased him into the parking lot and said ""If I ever catch you in my apartment again, I'll fucking kill you!""

Having never BEEN in this man's apartment, my boyfriend was confused, said ""Okay man"" and got in his car and started driving to work. He called me on the way and told me to make sure the deadbolt was locked. I did and told him to call the non emergency line (Note: At this time, we just thought this dude was victim of a break in and thought my boyfriend was part of it, we had no idea what was going on here). So he called them, they said they'd send someone over and to be home by 2 so we could give our statement. 

The roommate and I go about our day, listening to the banging, semi worried, mostly focused on applying for jobs (both of us recently unemployed). I'm more concerned than our roommate, but just waited for the cop to get here. 

Boyfriend comes back at noon, the banging stops at 1PM, at 2PM a cop comes over. She comes in, listens to our side of things (""We dont know this dude"",""weird noises last night"" ""threatened to kill me if i ever went into his apartment, I've never been in there"",etc), and goes up to talk to the neighbor. 

40 minutes go by. We can hear them through the floor, which really should have been a clue that the floor's structural integrity wasn't how it used to be. 

After 40 minutes, she comes back down and knocks on our door. We open the door for her, and she comes back in, turns around and deadbolts the door immediately. I'll never forget how she turned back to us and said ""Holy shit guys, its so much worse than we thought."" because that was the LAST thing I'd ever want a cop to say. I remember I burst out laughing. At the time life had been really rough on me and this just felt like a kick to the nuts. Of course it was worse than we thought. 

So I can't remember everything, there was a lot, but basically she went up there and this guy had FIVE locks on his door, that he himself had installed. He was VERY excited that a cop had ""finally"" come to help him. He claimed several things, but the ones that I can remember were that we had been floating (yes, floating) through the ceiling, whispering to him about how we would ""get"" him, how no one would ever believe him, how they'd never find his body, he claimed we had been sexually assaulting him every night, we've been spying on him and had put cameras in his apartment, he just couldn't find them because they were imperceivably small. How'd we get them in there? Well when we floated in there. Also that we had stolen his watch, his belt and had been drinking the milk from his fridge. 

So that knocking noise we had been hearing, from 3:30AM to about 1PM - well apparently he had decided he had had enough and ripped up all the carpet in the apartment and began digging a hole into his floor/our ceiling, to ""take care of the three punks downstairs"" and if the cops didn't do something about it, ""\[he\] would do what he needed to do, they needed to be stopped"" - based on his threat to my boyfriend, we took this to mean he planned on killing all of us. 

Oh, and what we thought were rats? Yeah turns out that he wanted to counter spy on us and had bought cameras and had been pushing them down the vents to try and spy on us. The  vents were in the bathrooms. I try not to think about it too much cuz the idea that this guy had footage of my 11PM shits and shower snot rockets (and you know, my naked body) is too creepy. The cop said the cameras he got weren't good quality nor were they hooked up to any sort of device that could save all the footage but still.

Often you're ""just"" doing covering fire... or not even using a rifle at all but driving a tank or flying a plane or whatever. And even if you blow up a building or an enemy tank you don't see the people who died because of your actions. 

Not sure if this psychologically makes a difference. But I've read that snipers often go through a lot of mental stress because they're ""closer"" to the enemy than other soldiers. Snipers may actually see the faces of the enemy before they kill them, something that turns the enemy more into humans and individuals than a faceless threat.",1647295135.0,2

If they did that, we would be continually exposed to this guy, and the cop could tell we were just knocked out of left field by this. It'd be months or YEARS of this following us around. So instead, she told us she would tell our apartment we needed to break lease and emergency vacate the apartment (the apartment had been notified at this point that this dude had ripped up the carpet and several light fixtures). Due to tennant laws in our state, they couldn't evict him immediately, but she could get us away from him immediately and she knew if we stayed he would eventually attack us. So what we had to do was vacate the apartment and get a restraining order. Because my boyfriend was technically the only one on the lease, he had to go get the restraining order. So he had to leave, and the cop had to leave to go with him and report to the judge.  She said she had called backup, but because this guy hadn't even technically gotten in, we had to wait for some cops to get done with other calls and get to us. The reason this needed to happen this way and with this timeline, was because if we got a restraining order first, and THEN he was admitted after we left the apartment, when they admitted him and he said ""my downstairs neighbors were r\*ping me"" the cop could say ""He doesn't have downstairs neighbors and the ones he did have have a restraining order against him"". It was the best way to protect us from dealing with it for years. But it meant leaving me and my roommate alone in the apartment. 

Before she left with my boyfriend to get the restraining order (This took a total of SIX HOURS because at this point it was 4PM on a Friday and the judge supposed to take care of our district had already left by the time they got to the courthouse. The whole time my boyfriends phone was dying so I had no clue when he'd get back) she asked if we had a gun on hand. We said yes - my boyfriends shotgun. She asked if I or the roommate knew how to use it, I said I did. In fact a month ago I had learned from a friend in the coast guard how to combat load it. She told me to keep it on hand but out of reach from the door. She had lied to the neighbor upstairs and claimed to be taking my boyfriend in for questioning, but had no clue if he would stay in his apartment like ordered. Not that that was safe either as he had already decided tunneling to us was a solution to his problems. 

I knew we were in a bad situation because the cop seemed so upset because she couldn't keep us safe. We were in a hard situation. Everyone involved in this was in a difficult situation, even mr crazypants upstairs. 

So that's how I sat, holding a shotgun in my lap for about six hours, next to my roommate, waiting for the crazy person upstairs to realize a door was much thinner and easier to get through than a floor-ceiling. And realized in that moment that if he came through the door, I was going to pull that trigger. That was honestly more traumatizing than realizing someone wanted to kill me - realizing that I was willing to kill them back. I think about that moment a lot, especially around the anniversary. It makes me feel cold in my soul. It takes something different inside someone to take a life, even in self defense, and you don't know its inside you until you're there. I haven't been able to watch the Life of Pi since, because I know what its like, having that Tiger on the boat (assuming you subscribe to that metaphorical interpretation). It's been five years and I still feel weird about that knowledge of myself now. 

To sum up the ending of a very, very long story, after six hours my boyfriend got the restraining order and the cops escorted us out of the apartment. We had just our backpacks, my medications, and the shotgun. We slept on several friends couches for two weeks while we tried to find a new apartment (and we did, eventually going back for our stuff). The first night I didn't sleep at all, just laid down next to my friends two puppies petting them, listening to my roommate and boyfriend snore. Last I had heard they were admitting mr crazy pants to a psychiatric hospital. That was five years ago and to be honest, I didn't really care to pursue it and just wanted as far away from it as possible.

I've now married said boyfriend and still am great friends with the roommate (who now has a girlfriend himself and god they're so cute together). Hilariously the \*NEXT\* upstairs neighbor (the one that ordered takeout every weekend and scared me haha) ended up being a therapist and helped me find a good one. I'm also god-mom to his dogs and he ended up playing Led Zeplin as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. So not all my neighbors have been bad lol

I just wanted to end by saying, I do not feel hatred towards the neighbor. I mostly feel pity. He thought we were torturing him, and if someone had been floating up and sexually assaulting me, I probably also would want to kill them. However I also do not feel guilt about holding a shotgun ready to shoot him, and I would not have felt guilty about shooting him if I had to. He was the one threatening to kill us after all and I'm sure if he had managed to kill my husband I probably WOULD hate him. I still cannot put into words how I exactly feel about it. My hope is he got help, somehow, and never put anyone else in danger. 

Hope you enjoyed the ride. I keep telling myself I'll put it on youtube but never get around to it lol",1647304309.0,7

Jake was so touched by how fast the fans funded his surgeries that he started crying. This whole experience was filmed and his reaction was to cry and say something like ""...after all those years, they never forgot me.""

Why Does Sticking One Foot out of the Bed Help You Sleep?

What does that have to do with our feet? A whole lot, actually. ‚ÄúFeet play a huge part in regulating your body temperature because they, unlike other parts of the body, contain arteriovenous anastomoses \[links between arteries and veins\], which dilate in warm temperatures, allowing more blood to reach the surface of the skin in order to cool it down,‚Äù Cralle says. ‚ÄúPlus, the bottoms of your feet are hairless, which helps to keep them cool.‚Äù That means, much like Cralle‚Äôs warm bath trick, sticking our feet out from under the warmth of the bedding helps along our bodies‚Äô natural pre-sleep cooling process, causing us to fall more quickly into a restful slumber.",1647302740.0,12
