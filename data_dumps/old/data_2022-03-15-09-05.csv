One ankle bite from a pit or a German Shepard and that's a wrap on your career, do you think it's reasonable to ask them to take that chance every time, over the thousands of dogs they'll encounter in a career? How long until they're wrong one time and that's it, no 2nd chance. 

They don't just shoot dogs willy nilly they shoot them when they're unleashed and aggressive, and almost always during trying to apprehend someone or get them to come out of a house. Those guys don't want to break a kids heart, but they're not gonna risk their career over it and we can't expect them to. 

I do wish they carried some sort of dart or non lethal specifically for dogs, but as with the taser, these are almost always split second decisions that have to be made. 

Cop pulls the dog dart as the dog runs at them, the suspect takes that opportunity to run at them with a knife and now they're not holding their gun. That's why they don't take the chance. 

It's simple, leash up the dog if the police show up.",1647348955.0,4

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting - this is not unlike when you get a Check Engine light over something that‚Äôs not related to the engine

348,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,5909,13282,0.94,"I'm fine now, but:

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind‚Äôs rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, ‚ÄúWell, now you‚Äôre just like the rest of us,‚Äù meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

Many months later, and I still get anxious if I stutter, or go into a room and forget why I went into it.

EDIT: There are a lot of replies about the ER doctor being called an idiot, so let me clarify. Firstly, the Neurologist called him an idiot, not me. I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests.

Something similar happened to me;

2 AM, i have to go to clg in the morning and i got up to get a drink. I am unable to walk properly because im suddenly feeling alot of pain in my left testicle.

I go to sleep thinking the pain would go away. I wake up for college and the pain is too much so i have to take a leave.

The pain goes away by afternoon after a long nap, and i go about my day.

Next day, same thing happens. And the very next day too.

I tried to un twist my testicle myself (idk why tf i ever did that), it helped ease the pain. And i heard that the pressure from ejaculation can help correct the torsion so i did that, even though i was in so much pain. I don't know why i did that, that could have caused so many problems.

 i'm 26 and I've been an alcoholic since 19. binge drinking benders for 3-4 days typically,  everyone around me knows i'm shitfaced, its just an embarrassing and shitty way to live. not only is it self-poisoning with horrible effects on the body, but I can't do anything for myself. i can't hold a job, go to school, or do anything productive while I'm drinking. lack of self-care entirely. no showers, shaving, brushing my teeth. just overall disgusting. it's gotten to the point where I'm not getting invited to social events because it's a gamble if I'll get blacked out and make a drunken fool of myself or not.  its not how I grew up at all and ever since 19 years old I've never been the same that I was. and thats not all. the crippling hangovers with constant suicidal thoughts and regret afterward. These are all of the reasons I'd like to get sober but every time I hit the one-month mark I slip up.

About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Didn‚Äôt need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn‚Äôt focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn‚Äôt remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I‚Äôve described seek medical attention.

It‚Äôs been two years almost now since that event and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight.

I was shocked in 2010 when I found out that I had an ulcer, spent about an hour reading about them, and then realised that I knew more about them than my GP, who had never heard of a bacterial cause of stomach ulcers, and tried to fob me off with Omeprazol. When I told him about h pylori (and the associated Nobel prize for medicine) he typed it into his doctors google thing and then said ""oh yeah"" and ordered a blood test...

GPs should really be under some kind of obligation to keep up to date with advancements in medicine. Obviously they can't be expected to learn *every* new thing, but you'd think if it was important enough to earn a Nobel prize that my doctor would have at least heard of it.

I once rented a house that turned me into a total hippie/urban homesteader. This yard was a foragers dream. Random volunteer plants in the summer from previous tenant gardens, blackberries in September, a grape vine, walnuts and sweet chestnuts in October. So I learned how to harvest all of these things and make stuff from them. I wouldn't say what we made from the grapes was *wine* as much as backyard hooch but it was fantastic as a sangria base.

Walnuts were the messiest, I learned that the black stuff you wash off the shell from the husk was used historically to make ink (and is still used as a basis for furniture stain!), but my GOD they were amazing in our Thanksgiving stuffing.

So one day, I went out to get some blackberries for pancakes and I noticed two random leeks growing along the fence.

Then she got her friend (yes the same one) to hook up with my buddy, who then convinced him to invite her to a party at his house I went to. I went into the bathroom and when I opened the door she was standing there. Freaked me the fuck out. I said ‚Äúhi, excuse me, I‚Äôm about to leave this house‚Äù when she pushed me as hard as she could back into the bathroom and came in and locked the door. At this point I freaked out and just started yelling for help. My buddy and a few others came and unlocked the door and pulled her out and I was able to get out of the bathroom. I started walking upstairs to head to the door and get in my truck to leave, when she flies out the door, and runs to my truck. She stands there while I am standing there in disbelief. At this point we had been broken up for months. I walk back inside and one of her friends approached me and told me if I told her, the friend, that I never wanted to see or talk to my ex again she would let me leave. I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving. 
This all happened after she did the following.
1) called me hundreds of times from a dozen numbers to which I blocked and requested she doesn‚Äôt call
2) egged new girlfriends car
3) tried to get me to do threesome
4) tried to make me fuck buddies
5) asked a very desperate friend of mine to prom hoping to get in our group

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off ‚Äújust over a block‚Äù from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I‚Äôd been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I‚Äôd been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

Nine months later, she married different guy 20 years her senior, pregnant with his child, on what would have been our dating anniversary. She recorded the ceremony so I got to see it circulating. Her vows were all about how the new guy was better than me.

But the ex said she was going with her kids (we didn‚Äôt live together, obviously) to stay at a resort (live in LV) when in fact she was staying at NYNY casino with a truck driver. Said driver got extremely drunk and belligerent the next morning/afternoon and she clearly must have too, because she ended up passing out in his truck cab that evening as he in a rage withheld her phone from her. He evidently discovered the phone video of me and her doing the deed and proceeded to post it on her FB page. 
I started to get texts/ calls around 7pm from friends, then her close friends. Was insanely embarrassing and heartbreaking at the same time. I was in a bar within the hour trying to calm down. 

Since said video was not (because of the angle) breaking any FB decency rules and her being passed out, it took until 10-11am the next day before it was removed. By that time her ex husband (yeah, bizarre) already had a missing persons report with the police. Everyone from her hometown was bugging him and me (most thought I posted it, at first) as to where TF she was.

Break up time. It was my lease and she had no intention of staying there permanently, so I told her I would stay at a friend's house for the rest of the month, while she found a new place. Yknow, because i was ""nice"". That gave her about three weeks. I went on an impromptu road trip with my buddy about two weeks into it and when I got back, she let me know she had moved out while i was away, so about a week prior.

When I got back to my apartment, every single thing I  owned was piled up, in the center of the living room. This isn't an exaggeration. The apartment looked ready to rent to new tenants, except for the massive pile of furniture, collectibles, clothing, medicine cabinet contents, food from the fridge and pantry and since it was June...fucking MAGGOTS!! It took a week to really sort through. I kept finding more fucked up stuff, like my childhood teddy bear, ripped at his neck, so his head just dangled there, 25 year old stuffing, bleeding out. I kept imagining her, dragging heavy shit around, carrying on with this for days, probably.

Epilogue...I ran into ole girl again, about a year later at a show. She acted like she was happy to see me ""after all this time"" and as if nothing totally fucked the fuck up hadn't happened.

I treated him very well even though I soon started feeling off for no apparent reason. I would feel awful, sweaty and aching with no energy but blamed it on starting the nightshift. But no matter how ill I had felt not long after he would get to my house I would start feeling good almost giddy. 

But our realationship seemed to be progressing nicely. We were redecorating the house ripping fireplaces out and getting rid of furniture and carpets.

Anyway it turns out that his intentions when he met me were very different to mine.

He had wooed me not because he saw us having a future together but because I owned my own house.

You see, before he met me he had gone from being a good little church boy to a druggy. This was ruining his marriage and his relationship with his kids. So he decided to find some wh\*re that owned her own house and get her to sign it over to him then overdose her. That way he could run his drug business from the house but without it being connected back to his kids and family home. We'd been decorating the house so that he could move into it. My mystery illness was him drugging me.

After I finished with him I was devastated. And going cold turkey. Meanwhile my family had decided I was a drug addict (voluntary) and turned on me. For years everytime I spoke I was called a druggy liar. I was'nt lying. Every family problem somehow became my fault even if I wasnt there. If they misplaced something Id stolen it and mom would search my bags, screaming accusations at me. I never stole anything. I developed neuralgia, one symptom was loud noises would make me pass out from pain, my mother would scream in my face making me pass out repeatedly.

She married young and moved away after high school‚Ä¶her husband was a defense contractor so they moved around a lot. We kept in touch by phone and met up about once a year for a mini-vacation. Back in 2019 I was going through a nasty divorce and she invited me to come live with her (with my 14 year old daughter) until the divorce was finalized (ex was unstable at this point).  I get to her home over 1800 miles away and find out that everything she‚Äôs told me for 32 years was a lie‚Ä¶her job, her being married, her living situation‚Ä¶everything. She was a hoarder and about 80% of the house was inaccessible. The parts that were accessible were filthy - she had multiple animals and there was poop everywhere!  On top of that, she was in the process of being evicted and she wanted me to give her $8k to lease a new home‚Ä¶in addition to spending every waking moment cleaning up her hoard. Her two daughters (21 and 19) were still living at home and they began telling me the rest of the story‚Ä¶how she had mountains of debt, how she planned to fleece me to get a new place to live‚Ä¶what‚Äôs worse was what they told me about what they had been through. She had mentally/emotionally/physically abused both of them throughout their childhood - just one example: she had beaten her youngest daughter with a wooden broom handle with such force that the broom handle broke. I asked my ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs‚Äù common law husband to confirm this and he said yes, it had happened TWICE. He also said that she would beat her oldest daughter with a laptop charging cable throughout her childhood and she had severe nerve damage in both legs because of it. I confronted my ex-friend about all of this and told her I was leaving and wasn‚Äôt going to give her a cent. She retaliated by calling the police on me and telling them I was selling opioids and meth - almost got arrested until the cops realized I had no record, no large sums of money, and no drugs. Then she called CPS on me saying I was sexually abusing my daughter‚Ä¶no proof (because I wasn‚Äôt guilty) and both her daughters made statements that their mother lied - didn‚Äôt hurt that ex-friend was known to CPS for abusing her own children. She then called my unstable ex - the one who had threatened to kill me - and told him where I was. It was a shit show. It took me two days to sort everything out and prepared to leave. In that time she called CPS and reported me three more times, and tried to steal my car. She also began calling my elderly/terminally I‚Äôll mother, telling her I was a drug addict/dealer and I‚Äôd been arrested. I won‚Äôt even go into the vile things she texted to my child.

When I was a senior in high school, my friend since I was like 5 got kicked out of her mom's house. Her mom was chaotic and not the best parent so my mom let her live with us without much question. My brother had just moved out so we had a spare room.

My friend lived with us for.. let's say a few months, I can't really remember, and one day I give my debit card to my brother to buy me booze. He texts me and says it's declined. 

That doesn't seem right so I check my account. Sure enough, several ATM withdrawals for a couple hundred bucks over the course of a week or so have been made, and not by me.

So I get home from work and am complaining to my friend that someone stole all my money and I have to file a police report etc. She leaves saying she's going to her grandma's like 10 minutes after this. 

The cop comes, I tell him what happened, he says he'll look into it. I have to file a bunch of paperwork at my bank. It's a pain in the ass. Somehow it comes to be known the withdrawals have all been from the bank my friend uses, and my mom suggests maybe it was her. I totally refute that, saying there's no way my best friend would do that to me. 

The cop calls me and basically says like ""we tracked the withdrawals, watched the ATM footage, found out it's said friend, her dad would like to pay you back in full if you won't press charges."" I say sure.

After paperwork agreeing to these terms is signed, she tries to talk to me and I tell her to leave. Her grandma calls me and pleads me not to kick her out. That ship has sailed grandma.

Anyway she comes back to move her shit out and I sit on the couch watching pawn stars while she struggles to carry and load a box spring by herself. I never found out exactly what happened, I assume she'd just take my debit card while I slept and put it back before I noticed. I'm not sure how she expected not to get caught..",1647318961.0,23

I being biracial took the opposite and like embracing diversity in a community as I believe it is beneficial in the long run. She was upset about this and muted me so I relaxed on that topic. She texted back and basically we made up. The next day I caught her in a lie that made me uncomfortable to continue conversation with her. Blocked her on all social media and phone contact. 

I spoke to my supervisor one day at work and found out she sent the screen shots of me venting as well as the debate we had about communities.

I wasn't home, but she convinced the landlord (who knew us) to let her in. I had told the propery management specifically to NOT let her in. Anyway, I came home and my house was completely empty outside of my dog and an empty fish tank. I'm not exaggerating the empty. She took everything that wasn't nailed down. Food from the fridge, cupboards, pantry, etc. She took the SHOWER CURTAINs. We had two irons, she took both of them. Took my furniture, TVs, game systems plus games. This bitch even took the light bulbs out of the light fixtures. And not just the easy to access ones. The ones that are above those apartment panels everyone knows about.

I called the police and told them I had been robbed. When they got there the landlord said he let her in. Her name is not on the lease. They told me it was a civil matter and they couldn't do anything about it. I was obviously upset and being loud. My ex-army buddy was with me. The cops threatened to bash my head into the wall, called me a mutt (I'm mixed) and then left.

Editing because this comment kinda blew up:

We tried going after the property management. Unfortunately, their excuse was there was nothing in writing and the property management ""didn't recall"" me telling them not to let her in. She had already established domicile unfortunately, so she has the same ""rights"" that I do as a tenant. I would have had to evict her or prove that she somehow posed a threat to my life.

Except, this was a hired driver from the firm I used to work at that dropped us off at the strip club after I explicitly said I didn‚Äôt want to go. It was my 21st birthday and I was hammered - everyone else already went home. He kept shoving drinks down my throat and shoveling drinks my way. 

I was in a short dress and drunk. He just left me alone in the strip club and men were starting to notice and approach me. After I confronted him outside for leaving me - he just took off running, I mean SPRINTING. I followed him because hello, drunk and dumb 21 year old me didn‚Äôt know what to do so he shoved me and I wet myself because of how hard he pushed me. 

Dozens of people saw this go down and I was bleeding from both knees. Two girls came up to me and asked me if I was okay and offered a ride. I asked who they were and where and why they would help me - they both picked me up and threw me in the car and tried to fcking kidnap me. They thought I was so intoxicated I couldn‚Äôt defend myself. I demanded to be let out of the car multiple times and finally I realized I had my cell phone. I called 911 on speakerphone and told them I was being taken, they slammed the brakes and threw me out and sped off. 

At this point, it‚Äôs well past 3am and I‚Äôm soiled, alone and realizing what happened. His friend‚Äôs girlfriend came to pick me up and begged me not to go back.

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

The main bathroom was painted light purple, had a walk-in shower, and always smelled like lilacs, because it‚Äôs her favorite flower. We‚Äôd have ‚Äúpicnics‚Äù in the basement while I‚Äôd watch Blue‚Äôs Clues on the big tube TV and drink spiced lemon tea with her. Sometimes we‚Äôd play tic tac toe on the porch and play with boxelder bugs. Some days we‚Äôd make French toast and eat it surrounded by her indoor plants while watching the birds. She knew each one by name, but my favorites were the finches.
There were willow trees at each corner of the property. Raspberry bushes lined one side of the area and we‚Äôd stay out there for hours, but I never filled my bucket. My grandma kept this huge garden behind my grandpa‚Äôs massive shed, and my dog is buried just beyond that.
We‚Äôd have campfires in the circular space between her red-mulch garden full of cone flowers, daisies, marigolds, hostas, and, of course, lilacs. I learned how to ride a bike there and the pine tree I crashed into still has a mark last time I checked, but that was years ago.

I felt so much guilt. I felt guilt for not knowing my.firsr doctor lied. I felt guilt for not being able to keep her inside longer. I felt guilt I couldn't save her and I felt guilt that it was likely my damaged egg that caused it. I survived the c section. I had physical scars and breasts full of milk waiting to care for a baby that would never come home. I hated myself. 

My husband never once blamed me. He was struggling, too. He was devastated. I couldn't do that to him. I couldn't leave him with all that grief. I kept trying to go on for him. And our cats. They were kittens, just babies, and I was still their mama. They still needed me. I got into therapy. It helped. 

That was ten years ago. I have two daughters who are happy and healthy. My husband and I have been through so much. I love him and our kids and cats so much. Life isn't always easy, but they are worth fighting for.",1647283558.0,179

When I was at my lowest, I thought things had no potential to get better, which was the most painful thing for me. I even called up the suicide hotline and walked them through the logic of why suicide was the logical option. They didn't have anything to say to me. Thankfully I stuck around because my life is fantastic now. If I could have written a story for my future when I was in my 20's (I'm in my 40's now), it would be about the life I am living.

There is this one girl, i dont remember her face or her name at all, i dont even know id she is still going to that church.
She comes, and she talked to me, she calm me down and pray together with me.

Im not that religious, although i still remember that moment.
Its not a big thing, she just calm down a kid, and in a way that she know and i know at the time, praying.
She isnt an adult either, i remember her being teen-like, maybe around 14-16 years old.

I dont think that person realize how much she effect my life.
We dont know when or whos life we can effect, and im sure most of the time we have no idea we did just that, over very small things. Like simply smiling to strangers, or go ask your old friend whats up.

If trying to live another day gave me just a small chance for me to do just that for someone else, im gonna try to hold into that, so maybe i can somehow lessen someone else's struggle, even when no one notice it, including me and them.

When I was completely alone at the house I went for the gun and sat down, thinking about it. In my mind at the moment, I couldn't find any reason not to do it, so I pulled the trigger. 

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"".

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren‚Äôt appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don‚Äôt we spend more time with them, why don‚Äôt we go out more, why don‚Äôt we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don‚Äôt do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven‚Äôt done it yet, I probably won‚Äôt ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,75

My ex died last August from a drug overdose in the woods. Well honestly in an empty lot next to a construction site. It was egregious and terrible and brutal for him, and not the way any human being should be photographed by police or remembered by their parents. 

Was it a drug overdose as suicide? Was it a garden variety drug overdose? I think there's a 90% chance it was overdose as suicide, his mother doesn't feel that and I would never try to change her mind. 

Regardless of the method though, even if it had been some magical peaceful method (and you know it's a cruel joke that mother nature makes damn sure it's impossible to kill ourselves peacefully) it wasn't about the photographs or what his mother had to see. 

It was the fact her child was taken from her. Adult child but still her son. The people we are put here in the world to love beyond all reason and protect and guide into the future beyond us. It breaks a person. 

She thinks about him everyday. She hurts everyday. I check in on her occasionally and we touch base. There's not going to be a day that goes by in her life that she doesn't think of her dead son. And there have been a very few days between August and today that I haven't thought about him.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1156

Wich means, that as game developpement progress and as resolution increase, we could maybe see more and more scopes realistically rendered in fps.

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

Moreover I also have a technical question for the devs out there : if you decide to render a second scene for the scope, does it typically don't add any load on the gpu, since it also stops rendering a similar area on the ""main"" image ?",1647347952.0,4

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but it‚Äôs been what like 8 years. I swore to never forget how bad Ghosts was despite how bad recent titles have been.",1647346009.0,23

Not necessarily the worst game, because Infinite Warfare clearly stands head and shoulders about the rest in that department, but ghosts was such a massive step back compared to BO2. Cod had an amazing run from cod4 to BO2 that came to a very abrupt end with ghosts.

* It had the worst maps of any cod game to date. Far too big. The one remedy for large maps is ground war yet that wasn't released on the old gen consoles which most people had at the time. 

* One of BO2's best features was the introduction of League Play, a massively popular gamemode. It took IW a couple of months to put in a worse version of it into their game. 
 
* The sniping as mentioned in this thread - awful. 

* Then the worst one, removing SnD?? I understand they added it in after a month or so but that was too late. You can't just remove one of your top 3 most popular and iconic gamemodes. 

* Impressive list of other stuff I totally forgot about by /u/ProTomahawks

Older games typically had fairly basic lighting processes, that would light in-game objects on the spot, as they were being rendered. It was trivial to generate reflections back then, because you could afford to re-render each object along the reflection plane (the location and angle that objects are reflected at), due to how basic the lighting processes were.

Nowadays, we have far more complex lighting processes that take place well after in-game objects are rendered, across many passes. We have one pass done at half resolution to compute the ambient occlusion across the entire screen, another half resolution pass to compute an approximation of global illumination, a third full resolution pass to compute shadowing, then a fourth to combine everything and light every object on screen in one go.

Because of this, generating reflections isn't as easy as it was back then. You'd essentially need to repeat this same process again, except on the reflected geometry, potentially many times over for each reflection plane you desire. This would obviously cripple performance, so alternative methods had to be devised, and the most common is screen-space reflections.

Screen-space reflections reuse what's already been rendered to the screen, to avoid having to repeat all lighting processes. This makes generating reflections quite fast, but comes with the downside that only the things that have been rendered to the screen can be reflected, and the moment they go off screen, they stop being reflected.

Because of this, screen-space reflections need another method to fall back onto, and that's typically some form of cubemap or environment probes. Put simply, these are 360 degree renders of the game world at different locations, that have similar lighting processes to old games (to make generating them nice and quick). When screen-space reflections fail, they can instead fall back to either of these, and while they both aren't as accurate, they are convincing enough during gameplay.

Now with hardware-accelerated raytracing (ie RTX), there's a new alternative (or even fall back method) to screen-space reflections, that use a similar principle to older reflections, except they support an infinite number of reflection planes while maintaining a fixed performance cost.",1647348612.0,2

They experience things we never did, that will define their childhoods (Roblox, VR Chat with their friends etc) and I guess Im just not willing to play the grumpy old ""back in my day"" type. Things change and have always done so.

I have a 3 year old and honestly, his age up until say 8-10, kids play outside for sure. Basketball, pokemon Go:ing, soccer etc. Not as much as we did, but we didnt have an option. But when they get a bit older and are more into socializing with their friends beyond just playing, the internet experience is their place.

Good weather days were spent on bikes, skateboards or disappearing off to the park, shops or places kids probably shouldn't have been going. Bad weather days where our parents would have had to sit around reading saw us just being lost in video games and watching cartoons that were equally as groundbreaking as that industry had a renaissance of its own around that time too. There was rarely nothing to do unless you were on a long car trip without a Game Boy. You did what you did because it was fun, not because you thought it would get likes on social media and it was enough just to be one of the best in school at something.

&#x200B;

And with the economy being more fair on the working class then we kinda ""had more"" too. Half the people I associated with back then had swimming pools at their place. We didn't have one but we always had somewhere to swim in summer without having to go to a public pool. I feel like you need to be a millionaire to afford such an ""unnecessary"" luxury now.  Big backyards were common. Food and snack portions were bigger and tasted better before corporate assholery shrunk them down, switched to cheaper ingredients and jacked up the price to satisfy their lust for endlessly increasing profit margins year after year. I'll never have a 90's era Cr√®me Egg again - today they're half the size, three times the price and aren't nearly as delicious as they used to be. Movies and music were just pumping out hits that didn't all look and sound the same - the blockbusters and chat toppers always had something for everyone and it wasn't just Disney making all the money. There was so much optimism for the future too, like our parents were the last generation to really endure any shit and sacrifice (after all they walked to school uphill both ways lol) but by the time we grew up we were going to enter a utopia, whereas now it feels like the world is just one more fuck-up away from ending.

The baby deer have been skiddish in my experience, but the adults don't mind us much. They won't let us get too close, but when they run they only go 20 feet or so and turn around and snort/stomp. I know some people have gotten to the point of feeding them by hand, but we don't do that because we don't want them thinking all humans are food sources. We got them to come initially by putting dried corn out there, and have since weened them off to only a little bit every week. We planted deer friendly grasses and bushes and they come back for those, and the babies hang out under trees and in bushes. There's a big preggo back there right now who should have her baby(s) any day.

So I to the fridge and there was two 40's of Mickey's Ice, two tall boys of Natty Ice, like a single can of really good local IPA, and a bottle of radioactive pink Mad Dog 20/20. I asked my uncle ""Are we sure he doesn't drink? This is the fridge of a broke alcoholic, not like a selection for guests"". But apparently when his nurse came to take him to the store once a week he would just go to the gas station and pick up beers/ wine coolers if he knew he was having guests. He didn't get visitors that often. So when I moved to the same city he was in, I would go over there and watch baseball games with him, order pizza for us, and drink 40's of Mickey's Ice, lol.

I remember when Fiona Apple's ""Shameika"" won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance, and people were up in arms about it not really being Rock.  I really like the song.  I still have no idea whether it's really Rock or not.  But every 10 years or so, a totally new music emerges and becomes part of ""Rock and Roll"".  If your definition of Rock and Roll is Chuck Berry, you might be surprised by the Beatles ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", even though they were big fans of Chuck Berry.  If your definition of Rock and Roll is the Beatles, you might be surprised by funk emerging in the 70s.  (Actually I remember this discussion coming up separately on reddit once, of whether or not funk is rock.  To me it is, at least...)  If your definition is funk, you'll be surprised by New Wave.  If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

If I were to try to define Rock and Roll, maybe some of the key features are that it is loud and features guitars, but neither of these things are actually essential.

I've never been starstruck, and I don't conflate celebrities with characters they've written about or played in songs or movies, etc.  It's a job.

I was in the production office at Butler Square, across from the Target Center arena, for the 1994 Earth Day concert in Minneapolis, and getting ready to go up the elevator.  Behind me were a couple of girls... When the elevator doors opened, it was Steve and it turns out the two girls were his nieces who drove over from Wisconsin (where he was born).

He basically came across exactly like any typical uncle talks to their nieces and nephews... not a rock star.  Just a sort of ""hey that's our uncle and he's in this band"" kind of guy.  Very folksy, laid back, middle America kind of guy.

I think Lennon summed it up best:

There's a reason why Shania Twain and Clay Aiken aren't still pumping out at least passable good music, but Madonna is. Madonna works with the best. Always. Fresh, new, new sounds, beautiful tracks. It's possible for Dolly, and even a Britney Spears, if they get a fresh new crew. Honestly, I'd only trust Madonna to manage teams for older stars, as odd as that is to say. She's has the best track record and longevity and an uncanny ear for the next new sound under her belt. She can hear or see something totally new and just know how it will work.

Dolly re-did Old Flames beautifully with Keshsa on her ""I'm a real artist"" album. Jack White blew his pud on Loretta Lynn. I would suggest someone who still has a fight in their belly. A great writer and lover of Dolly. The writer would have to know her, and still have a fight. As risky as this sounds, I'd hire Diane Warren to co-write, and Madonna to produce. Diane has such an ear, and so does Madonna. Plus neither put out crap. It would cost a fortune, but it would be gorgeous.",1647324867.0,3

Much as I love Plant, let that guy cash his Allison Krauss checks (richly deserved as those are both great albums) and get Joe Duplantier.

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that. Duplantier's ability to shift from growls to clean vocals offers interesting interplay with Parton's high, gentle voice and his solid groove in his rhythm playing would provide a great drive.",1647314465.0,1

It sounds counterintuitive, but social media and other forms of mass communication actually make it more difficult to reach extreme levels of fame as it spreads the audience out too thin and keeps things fragmented.

I don't even know if I'd say Thriller was his peak, I think it might have been Bad, the next album. I was a bit too young for thriller, although even then I was aware of it but as big as he was I think Bad cemented it. Around the same time we got Moonwalker, which I got to see in the cinema and one of the first Megadrive games I owned was a Japanese copy of the Moonwalker game.

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyonc√© with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded. This century it seems more like songs have a very brief shelf life and peak after a few weeks and then vanish",1647359296.0,1

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn‚Äôt listen or watch the video because of ‚Äúsatan‚Äù. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church ‚Äúdances‚Äô.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20‚Äôs at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that‚Äôs come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn‚Äôt miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ‚Äôs life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That‚Äôs fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you‚Äôll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince‚Äôs unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It‚Äôs like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn‚Äôt exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don‚Äôt really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

6233,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,661,16539,0.94,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

I'm appalled at the effects of Russian money in our elections and political campaigns. Sadly, we can't call the police to do anything about it now, we don't have that option.

Did Deripaska use the normal process for removing a squatter?

> The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

> After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

> * leave your property within 24 hours  
> * stay away from your property for 12 months

> To get final possession of the property, you must make a claim for possession.

No, they broke the door open and arrested them for trespass. So, actually, I'm more appalled that Russian Oligarchs who are sanctioned get more favourable treatment than British home-owners, who have to get a court IPO to have squatters removed.

What's the evidence that this guy had any more to do with Russia's invading the Ukraine than any single American citizen did with the US invading Iraq to find the made up weapons of mass destruction?

So then Reddit is happy when refugees take the property of the rich? Most Americans are considered exorbitantly rich compared to the average citizen of India or Honduras. If your best friend had a vacation house in Greece, would you rejoice if Greek activists broke into it to house Syrian refugees, and the police seemed to be supporting them, and that it is justified because your friend is considered rich and it's his government's fault there is war?

If you say, ""This guy is rich so he can handle it,"" you could probably handle it if someone stole $100 from you, but how would you feel if they did?

What I see is that the happiness in the comments is either racist ""fuck this guy who is Russian because his government did something bad"" or (more likely I think) hypocritical jealousy ""fuck this guy who has more than I do.""

The report also states that Manafort was sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, though investigators couldn't determine why. The report outlines Kilimnik in contact with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, trying to resolve an issue involving Manafort owing a debt to Deripaska. The report goes on to state that the Russian oligarch wanted Manafort to advance Deripaska's interests in the event that Trump won the election. It should also be noted that following the election President Trump dropped sanctions on certain companies that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska's bottom line, though no direct link was established in the Mueller Report.**


*Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[1]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)*


>The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort **[redacted]** did not see a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

>...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, **[redacted].** Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 

>Gate's account about polling data is consistent **[redacted]** with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, **[redacted].**

>The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:

>> *I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.*

>> *Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]*

>Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.

**Furthermore, after being elected the Trump administration removed sanctions from Russian entities that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)**

>The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.

>...The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from¬†stray dog rescue¬†to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.

>The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal‚Äôs biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.

>And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.

>In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them ‚Äî in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.

>Notably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.

>...The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.

>Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.

>...Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.

>‚ÄúScore that a win for Putin,‚Äù¬†tweeted¬†Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.

Btw, sorry to interrupt, there's a rumor circulating (in the fog of war i'm not sure rn) that zelenskyy wanted to cancel all taxes in ukraine in the war economy; still while it makes sense it's hard to check now have they checked whether their budget close ? :x Not sure it does; and they still need to pay their men (and pensions, emergencies, foreign deliveries etc) and basic services to keep society running on its footing. And prolly the billionaires and ultrawealthy should be put to contribution to some degree :/ in french they say that money is the nerve of war (or can the EU prop up a bit their funding?)

edit i'd probably add a provision in the martial law too that fighters/soldiers can't be foreclosed/evicted (loose their home) due to unpaid/unpayble bills too right now :x

edit i'm concerned some oligarchs are trying to loot the state budget in the middle of the war, and are helped by some equally questionable republicans

We know enough. Even more than what gets reported in ""western"" news. But what of it?

Like, how is this even supposed to work, that you show Russians videos of ""army shelling cities"" (some of which are actually recycled older videos from Donetsk, that were already presented to Russian audience as ""evidence of Ukrainian agression in Donbas"" few years ago), and they will wave their magic wand, and all the war, strife, hunger and famine suddenly disappear?

For a lot of people, it is what they believe and want, but it was and is a political rhetorical hammer, to bash your opponent without actually doing anything other than adding additional funds to the war machines of the military industrial complex.

This is not really true. That's what it *should* be about.

They didn't even criticize the troops, just the president and the war. And that was the end of a very popular country music band.

All because you live in some kind of fairy tale, where the total dictator of Russia, what? Couldn't get away with executing Maria? Or is it that you think he wouldn't actually be evil enough on paper to dispose of someone who publicly undermined him in such a huge way? 

Even if he gave a crap about killing someone like that, which I assure you, he most certainly does not. He can't just let people get away with that and go Scott free. Lest everyone get the idea they can behave that way and remain unscathed by consequence. You don't get to singlehandedly rule an entire country, their wants and needs be damned, what you say goes, buy what you wanna buy with the country's wealth, just do whatever the eff you want basically, at the populations expense while many of them suffer greatly... Especially in this day when a lot of them will know damn well that most other countries are not this way in the slightest, that most of the civilized world enjoys freedoms they can only dream of.

You can't keep that kind of thing under control if you aren't one of the coldest, most ruthless, murderous psychopaths walking the planet currently. It just wouldn't hold up for long...

 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

I was a college kid. Not even a political science major. Was just simply interested in the way government really worked. WAsn't doing it for the reference letter or any big future connection (since I had no ambition to work in politics at all). 

I just wanted to see American government for myself. 

And holy SHIT.

What a bunch of shitbags.

I worked 100 feet from Newt Gingrich. (This was in the 90s; I was in Rayburn.) I went to the Congressional dining room all the time. Gave tours of the Capitol. Did all that shit. And every second of it was like bathing in oil and spit. 

One fun thing I got to do:

I'd never worked an office phone before. Or a fax. And I kept fuckign them up. 

One day Jack Kemp called for my boss. 

""Yes, sir, Mr. Kemp,"" I said. ""I'll put you right through.""

And then I pushed---or thought I pushed---the connect-call button. But somehow I fucked it up.

And hung up on him.

I hung up on Jack Kemp.

He called back.

""So sorry, sir,"" I said. ""We've been having trouble with these phones all week. I'll put you right through.""

Then I did it again.

He called back again.

I gave him some line again.

Tried again. 

Hung up on him again.

THRICE I hung up on Jack Kemp. 

Finally, almost in tears, I had to beg another intern---one who hated me---to do it for me.

Then, he wants to act like he's the bigger person by ""Not getting drawn into this war.""

Except does that make any sense at all? Why on earth would Ukraine **want** to draw Belarus into attacking them? Ukraine isn't on the offensive here, they're fighting a purely defensive war, the **last** thing they want is to draw in a new attacker while also jeopardizing their global good will by committing an act of aggression. If they HAD long range missile capable of an attack like that, what possible reason would Ukraine have for launching them at Belarus, and not Russia, or the occupying Russian forces?

It does, however, make sense for *Russia* to have secretly fired that missile, especially if done from Ukrainian territory. Then, they can say they that not only are they such good allies of Belarus for helping stop this one missile, but that obviously Ukraine is a threat and they must join forces to stop them.

It's a classic False Flag attack, one of many we're likely to see from Russia as their position gets more and more tenuous.

> Alexander Lukashenko, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, says that the country has been hit by a Point-U missile, but says he is &quot;Not going to&quot; take part in the war and has &quot;Not been asked to join it&quot;.

> As a confirmation, just two days ago at night another Point-U missile was launched at the territory of our Belarus, which we together with Russians successfully intercepted and destroyed over Pripyat.

> The Ukrainian air defence system shot down a missile fired from the territory of Belarus in Kyiv.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

When the rose slowly bloomed in the studio splash screen, I let out a hefty chuckle because it seemed so retro and campy at the same time. I heard sneers from 2 rows behind us. My girlfriend was embarrassed after about 20 minutes when I was laughing so hard I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath. The movie audience of about 35 was completely silent but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn‚Äôt be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie. Sometimes I think my laughter just became so infectious because it was so cathartic and uproariously uncontainable. The movie would not be denied, I hadn‚Äôt laughed that hard for eons and when ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to‚Äù, that made it even funnier and more taboo - and even funnier.

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

He was however, allowed to make a sequel. He elected to go ahead and film Evil Dead II as a remake and then tack 10 minutes of exposition on at the beginning to technically make it a sequel - so your method is pretty spot on for how it was intended to be watched.

Those ten minutes are the part he compromised to get it greenlit, everything else was all him. 

People tend to talk down Evil Dead but I think both are excellent, just different vibes. You can't deny that Evil Dead is fucking crazy impressive for how it was produced and the history, and Evil Dead II is the payoff where those crazy kids got to come back to their baby and do it with some budget and some actual understanding of how films are made lol.",1647344555.0,1

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90‚Äôs.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

Sam raised the money for E.D. himself. Most of the money came from dentists and folks like that Sam convinced into investing. 

Sam, Rob, and Bruce got that film finished with a stolen camera from the university of Michigan, gallons and gallons of Karo syrup, and pure determination. 

From everything I've read and seen, there's no indication Sam had any other version in mind when he filmed E.D. 

After the small success of E.D., Sam decided to redo it. But all the Chosen One stuff and Annie and all that were things Sam came up with much later. Hell, Scotty is the hero of part 1. Not Ash.",1647314515.0,4

Yeah, that's precisely my problem. The Marvel universe has a good number of geniuses, and apparently any of them can make something that competes with Peter's most iconic power. So why don't all the heroes have a smaller version? Clint can have web arrows, Steve can have a tether to his shield, and all of them can just toss out a little net to trip up enemies. Even if they aren't coordinated enough to swing, all of them would benefit from an easy to make net device. And we know it's easy to make, since Peter can do it out of a dumpster!

It also raises the problem of Peter's most iconic conflict -- he's poor as shit. But since these amazing webs can be made from common materials and it's just a matter of application, Peter can just patent a sticky net grenade or whatever and sell them as a nonlethal immobilizing tool to immediately solve his money problems forever. Think a can of silly string with more stopping power than bear mace, he'd make gangbusters.

It‚Äôs beautifully animated, but the story is weak and kind of nonsensical. The music is alright, most of the songs are pretty catchy (‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Talk About Bruno‚Äù is overrated AF, and the best song is the one She-Hulk sings), but mostly sound like generic pop music with a radio-friendly structure and sound rather than a theatrical/movie musical structure and sound. The lyrics can get clumsily busy, and I really wanted to hear a soundtrack/score that sounds more Latin American than what was ultimately offered. There‚Äôs only a few hints of Latin Jazz, Cumbia, and Habanera here and there. The music just comes across as generic and easily replaced, most of it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs part of the movie. 

   There‚Äôs also so many characters in this movie with the writers trying to fully flesh out each one, but it falls flat in a movie made for the attention span of children.  Seriously, there are so many characters it‚Äôs impossible to remember all their names unless you‚Äôve seen the movie multiple times. The only name I can remember is Bruno, and only because his name is in a song title. Had to come up with nicknames for them that either describe their powers or their relationships to other characters, like Animal Boy, Brown Poison Ivy, Batgirl, ADHD Nightcrawler, the aforementioned She-Hulk, Narcissistic Grandma, Main Girl, Animal Boy‚Äôs Dad, etc. The only character you can remember the name of is the one we‚Äôre not allowed to say. 

I know Encanto is a strictly Disney Film and not a Disney Pixar film like Coco, but Coco is far superior  (faaaaaaarrrrrrrrr superior) when it comes to a movie about Latin America, the people who live there, and the importance of family. The plot isn‚Äôt muddled and anti-climactic, the music actually feels like it belongs in the movie, and there‚Äôs still a large cast of characters, but they‚Äôre handled appropriately: you can remember the names of all the characters important to driving the plot, and the rest of the cast is mostly there for support, comic levity, and variety of voices delivering incidental lines.

Also Coco made me cry and want to see it again, and I finished Encanto feeling neutral and uninterested.",1647334879.0,3

The characters go through significant change, potentially some of the most I have seen in a family friendly movie. 

The whole point of the movie is that the grandmother's expectations and desires for the family has been ruining most of their lives. And that demanding outward perfection and hiding problems is harmful. The grandmother learns to see her family for who they are and not who she wants them to be.

For instance you have the aunt who alters the weather when she is upset. But she is told to calm down so she doesn't alter the weather. Rather than anyone wondering why she is upset. Or that Luisa feels inadequate despite constantly helping.",1647343330.0,3

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,33

**Another argument against Latinx is that ""it erases feminist movements in the 1970s"" that fought for use of the word Latina to represent women, according to George Cadava, Director of the Latina and Latino Studies program at Northwestern University.[34]

Senior editor of Latino Rebels Hector Luis Alamo describes the term as a ""bulldozing of Spanish"".[10] In a 2015 article, Alamo wrote: ""If we dump Latino for Latinx because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive.""[58]

Wayne State University professor Nicole Trujillo-Pag√°n has argued that patriarchal bias is reproduced in ostensibly ""gender neutral"" language[59][60][61] and stated, ""Less clear in the debate (as it has developed since then) is how the replacement silences and erases long-standing struggles to recognize the significance of gender difference and sexual violence.""[62]

A 2019 National Survey of Latinos found that only 3% of Hispanic-Latinos have ever used ""Latinx"" to describe themselves.[63]**

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,1

Over the years, seeing my friends relationships and the issues they face, seeing innumerable horrifying stories about relationships here on reddit, and expanding my hobbies and learning to use my time, it became less a cope and more a happy comfort.  Theres a lot of benefits to being single that people don't talk a lot about.  I can decide to drive 10 hours to see friends and family for a week long vacation with basically no planning or notice (my job is also pretty lax about that stuff, thankfully).  When I get food and have leftovers, they will stay in my fridge till I eat them.  I always know where everything is in my apartment cause its always where I left it.  A few years ago, my job moved several hours away.  The people with families or SOs had to talk about the move and weigh their options with their partners.  I decided to go, and had nothing to hold me back.

I'm sure theres benefits I'm not even thinking about cause I haven't ever lived with a partner (I have had roomates though).

Its not something I'd recommend for everyone.  A lot of people would probably go mad living how I live.  Some folks just need people around to be happy, and that makes sense, we're a social species.

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food. These story tropes prime viewers to reject healthy foods and prepare them for the fast food and TV dinner ads during the breaks.",1647304253.0,2

There's no evidence that he actually said that, it was first attributed to him in 2005. The only recording of him saying ""temporarily embarrassed capitalist"" is him criticizing American Communists for being too wealthy. Here's the quote. 

>Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property. ""I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew‚Äîat least they claimed to be Communists‚Äîcouldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.""

WRONG...

EDIT:

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

Hard work paying off is literally just RNG. My parents worked hard, my relatives, my peers‚Äô parents? All hard workers. Who was the only one who made it out of poverty? My parents.

I had class privilege growing up so I was ignorant for a while but in college I got to meet a lot more people and finally started listening to them. 

Being poor is expensive. 

If you start with 3 apples and you‚Äôre consistently spending those 3 apples and also bringing in 3 apples, how is it possible for there to be upward mobility? 
And say they cut expenses. Okay cool. But it reaches a point where you really cannot cut down any more. Now you got 1 apple to spare. 

And this is when ‚Äúlife happens‚Äù tend to happen. If you own a car, something broke down. An emergency came up. You need new shoes for work cuz your current one is falling apart. Everything you saved up just got wiped.

Not only that, but the shoe example: They can‚Äôt splurge on better quality shoes either cuz they can only afford the cheapest ones. And guess what happens? It gets ruined in the future and it repeats. You‚Äôre cycling through the same amount of apples no matter what you do. 

As i said there‚Äôs only so much you can cut in an effort to save without sacrificing other aspects like your mental health. And even when saving, there are a whole bucket of obstacles that ppl don‚Äôt consider: time. 

If you‚Äôre born into poverty, chances are, you live further from your work than someone who lives closer to where most work would be. If you live in the suburbs you NEED a car. But regardless if you drive or bus, chances are you are working with a much smaller time frame to do things in your life than the person living in the more expensive place. 

Nothing I said implies that climbing out of poverty isn‚Äôt possible. It‚Äôs definitely possible. My parents are perfect examples. But with the given information and just looking around, I HIGHLY doubt my parents somehow worked 10x harder than my other relatives or my peers. 

You need hard work AND luck to move up.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,86

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

The left will talk about wanting socialism and at times will praise self-proclaimed socialist/communist countries (dictatorships) and promote their propaganda (Cuba, Venezuela, etc) and the right will talk about how they don't want to end up with socialism ""like Cuba or Venezuela, etc"".

The Nordic Model is not equal to socialism and hasn't made those countries socialist in Europe.

For others, making minimum wage at Walmart is the same ""class"" as a tradesman, or even a doctor, and thus moving from one income level to another is not upward mobility... that upward mobility can only be acheived if one earns enough wealth to not have to work, or if one goes from not having to work to their children not having to work, nor their children's children.

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

Making less makes it harder to see the benefits of financial literacy, but it does not make the entire discipline irrelevant. If anything, it makes financial literacy a far more important topic - because the stakes are dire.

It is expensive to be poor. That is very true, especially in our disposable society. The cheapest thing now is often more expensive tomorrow.

Don't take my comment to mean that it's the fault of poor people that they're poor.

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure. I say a ""dash"" because the results aren't weighted by population or anything - the Scandinavian countries each count just as much as the UK in the analysis, even though their combined population is less than half of the UK's and they have vastly simpler political structures and internal administrative challenges.",1647306813.0,29

Maybe upper-working class/lower-middle class (depending on if you consider working class to exist in between middle and lower classes).

I find the classical definition of upper, middle, and lower/working class to be meaningless. I think that the classes should fit the following definitions:


**Upper class** - Family income is in excess of 700k, usually in the millions per year with passive income. Easily pays all bills and can eat incredibly expensive meals every single day if they wished. Passive income is far greater than earned income and they can maintain their lifestyle while having more assets than debts with just their passive income. Most purchases, including houses and boats, would make minimal impact on their wealth. Can survive any but the worst financial crises and pay any expense. Can retire at any moment they wish. 


**Middle class** - Family income ranges from 100k to 700k +. Easily pays all bills and can eat expensive meals often. More assets than debts, likely has passive income but it does not exceed their salary or they couldn't maintain their lifestyle without their salary. Many large purchases would make minimal impact on their wealth, larger purchases like houses and expensive vehicles must be loaned/mortgaged. Can usually survive most financial crises and can easily pay most major expenses. Able to retire comfortably and live off their passive income without eating the principle.


**Working class** - Family income ranges from above poverty level to comfortable 100k-200k range. Can pay all bills and eat comfortably, barring large unexpected expenses. More debts than assets until retirement age (and sometimes not even then), their only passive income is typically from their 401k and is not enough to live on without eating into the principle. Most large purchases would need to be budgeted and planned for, larger purchases like houses and vehicles must be loaned/mortgaged. Can be financially ruined by financial crises such as a medical disaster, destroyed home, etc, but the upper levels of working class usually have enough savings to pay for most major unexpected expenses without going into debt. Can retire relatively comfortably.


**Lower class** - Family income at or below poverty level (specific to the area they live in). Often have to choose what bills they can pay and what bills they have to pay late. Eating a full and healthy meal is often beyond what they can afford, let alone going out. Almost no assets at all, and usually a large amount of debt. Any purchase at all must be budgeted and planned for, and often requires going into debt or having help to purchase. Cant obtain a mortgage without the aid of a government program, probably can't get a car loan either. Any unexpected expense will often put them in debt or even ruin them financially. Likely won't be able to retire without family assistance.


The key differentiator between middle class and working class is that the working class dont own their own business, real estate, or other form of significant passive income, and often don't have more assets than their debts.",1647352239.0,2

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems?

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

The process is called 'priming.' People are more likely to pick something they feel they are familiar with even if they don't remember how or why they became familiar with it in the first place. It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high. Information for whatever reason tends to lose context in memory and all that's left after a while is just the impression. It doesn't matter much where that impression came from.

In an era in which action against collective entities was discouraged among the general populace (e.g. a few hundred years ago), but action against individuals was encouraged (e.g. physical fights and duelings seen as legal), this might reverse.

Heck, it might even reverse in the USA less then 100 years ago when lynchings were de facto legal and unionization efforts scorned as communistic or otherwise un-American.

A good point brought up below was social media, which could be a societal reversion to a more balanced ability to act against both collective entities and individuals. OTOH social media also makes it easier for others to act against you, which might create a counter-balance away from individual enmity, as being hostile to an individual psychologically increases the thought that people will be hostile towards you.

Lots of stuff is wrong in Canada, for lots of reasons. Can we really not acknowledge that we‚Äôre not always right? Must every political conversation result in a purity test? Is it possible that good public policy is a moving target?

The issue is ideological rigidity. A complete lack of will to even entertain alternatives.

On one side is truckers who refuse to acknowledge their protest did attract neo-Nazis, confederates, conspiracy nuts, and other anti-democratic assholes.

On the other is a government that refuses to acknowledge the distrust, whether founded in reality or not, that comes from a seemingly inconsistent and arbitrary Corona response.

Only by accepting that we are sometimes wrong and being willing to change course can we actually improve. Acting as if we have the answer and everyone else is wrong leads nowhere.

 screens prior to its premiere. Fox was promoting the hell out of Brisco  
 County. 

 It's first Friday night was a 2-hour episode, the next Friday   
night, there was a ""UFO special"" on Fox after Brisco County, the third   
Friday night, Sept. 10, 1993, The X-Files started its run.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

  
 I used to work at a graphic arts company and our shift was 2p-10p m-f.    
Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick   
took over and our interest started to wane.",1647359676.0,1

Newton‚Äôs tidal mechanism is wrong

Fill water in bath tub, draw a red line to mark the water level.

Without touching the water, how can you make water level change?

I will use hair blower to heat up the side of the tub, so thermal expansion of the tub will change the red line position.

Sunlight circling around earth, heats up landmass. Thermal expansion cause coastal seabed bending. Different size, shape and slop of the bay have different hight of the tides.

All scientists are confused. They don‚Äôt understand tide is an illusion of sea level rise and fall caused by coastal seabed bending caused by thermal expansion of the landmass caused by sunlight circling the earth.

They are also stupid. Rain and snow always falling down at full moon. How can moon‚Äôs gravity cause sea water rising 50 feet high?

They are also liars. They say moon‚Äôs gravity cause two water bulges on earth and earth is moving under the two water bulges at 1000 miles per hour around equator.

They are evil. Create false tidal theory, deny fact and control media. 

Another lie is Van Allen Belts.

If there are Van Allen Belts protect earth from solar wind, how can we see stars? Why Van Allen Belt not falling to earth?

How can earth magnetosphere capture and held electrons and protons from the solar wind? What mechanism? Where are those charged particles in the Van Allen Belts? Are they forming into hydrogen or not?

Another scientific lie is earth has two magnetic poles.

If earth has magnetic poles why iron is same weight around earth? Magnetic force is decay at distance cube. Iron should be million times heavier at the magnetic poles.",1647359717.0,1

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

To add to this, counter AA technology NEEDS you to be targeted to counter them

In electronic warfare. The pilot needs the AA battery to turn their RF systems on (like radar and RF guidance for missiles) to geolocate their position, submit it to the rest of the forces, then counter attack *likely before the AA battery even fires*

HARM missiles are basically automatically locked when you have a radar lock on you and you just press a button pointed in the right direction and it guides itself to the AA battery that's targeting you",1647346122.0,3

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular.

He flew un-manned drones towards these sites, and the Iraqis, thinking they were American f-15s and 16s, turned on their radars and fired.

They even triumphantly reported kills!

US and NATO pilots tend to have an average of 200 flight hours per year, while Russian pilots only get somewhere between 60-100. The US and NATO pilots use that extra flight time to train on stuff like SEAD.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week.

NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process.

The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio.

JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

Russia tends to use much cheaper fixed radar arrays because they are cheaper for the effect. However, the USA uses directional radar arrays. These can be steered so that you can search for targets at all times or halted to focus on one key area. They are more expensive but also better as a result.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

It also means that modern US systems can shoot a missile that an entirely different plane will guide to its target, which is wild.

AESA radars are also just harder to jam, apparently, for technical reasons that go over my head.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.  I was reading a few days back a thread of people who'd tracked cruise-missile launches by planespotting the rockets from cellphone cameras and CCTV back to the launch corridor within minutes.

So, essentially as it moves away from the center of gravity (in this instance, think of it as the center of the star although it's a little bit off), it arcs quite slowly, but as it approaches the star it whips around.

Think of this orbit as kind of like a baseball field.  When you're going around the outfield, you're not turning that much in any one step, but as you come around home plate each step has a huge amount of arc in it.

If you draw a line through the middle of home plate, each side has 180 degrees. When you're near home plate, you can walk from one side around to the other in 2 or 3 steps. You've covered those 180 degrees in 2 or 3 seconds. 

Walking the same speed, it will take you what, 10 minutes? 20 minutes? to walk around down to third base, around the outfield, back down to first base, and back to home plate, completing the other 180 degrees and get back to where you started.

The end result of this is that for each degree of bend, when the object is in the outfield, it has many more steps to get across that degree, and so gravity out there, despite being weaker, has more time to act upon it.

The thing is, we just take it that something 'escapes' an orbit, but the assumption there is that gravity affects it by such a small amount that it's negligible. And of course, other larger objects affect a far away body much more.
