297,funny,Dolphin trolls a seagull!,Ltcommander83,1647353576.0,757,48123,0.95,"The two instances of dolphin intelligence that stuck with me the most:

1) [The Dolphin fishermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwWfYLKFw0) in Brazil. Basically *the dolphins* figured out they can catch more fish if they work with us, so they purposefully chase schools of fish into our nets. This plan was concocted by the dolphins, ***NOT*** by the local fishermen, and the dolphins call the shots for all the fishing jobs. They signal, they choose where to fish, they choose when to fish, they're clearly in charge and the brains of the operation. All we did was recognize the value and play along.

2) Wish I had kept the vid of this but didn't wanna watch it again when I first found it: it was in Japan. A bunch of fishermen cornered a dolphin in a cove (is that the right word? Rock formation along the coast where you could block off one part and trap anything in the water) and it being Japan, of course the goal was to catch it and eat it. The dolphin was distressed and trying to escape, but couldn't. The dolphin's last ditch escape attempt...? It lept out of the water and onto the rocks, leaping towards one white, blonde tourist duo in a group of otherwise japanese fishermen. It was like the dolphin could recognize the dangerous ones and the *only* duo present that might help the dolphin, so the dolphin lept to them for help. That was....painful to watch. Whether the dolphin could recognize the difference due to the languages being spoken, the different physical features, the clothing or what have you...it doesn't matter. If they're smart enough to recognize such a difference and use that to make a logical conclusion, then we probably have no business killing and eating the damned things.",1647366909.0,1

So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide.

I agree with the sentiment that standardized testing disproportionately favors the wealthy, those with the resources to pay for prep classes, but the way to fix it can and should be to focus on economic resources instead (e.g. look at the family's tax returns and offer spots for economically disadvantaged groups). Alternatively, we could give AA based on certain school districts (e.g. disadvantaged inner city schools), so as to even the playing field due to unequal resources.

As it stands, it seems racist to me that we would assume someone who is of a minority race needs an advantage based simply on their race in order to succeed. I'm currently at a fairly elite law school institution, and some of my minority peers have stated that they are also upset with AA because some in my class assume that they got in solely for their race as well. The current race-based AA system cultivates this kind of racist mentality. If we truly believe that everyone is equal, then it doesn't make sense that we treat one group unequally based solely on the color of their skin.

Finally, the AA system today is a backend fix to the problem, akin to putting a band-aid on a slash wound. Multiple studies have shown that those who get in due to AA regularly perform poorly in university and suffer higher drop out rates (see, e.g., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3699572?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents;](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3699572?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents;) [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/)).

There was an alternative school in the we district. It was essentially a storefront property with rows or computers. No talking, no phones, very strict. Those kids got sent there. And the result? Nearly every single one of those kids graduated. Kids who never, **ever** graduate otherwise, or even make it past freshman year were graduating almost every single time.

It was about how the American Medical Association put out a guide to ""inclusive language"" for doctors and other healthcare workers.

For example, it recommends avoiding the term ""vulnerable"" to describe a group at-risk for a disease and to instead use ""oppressed"" even though that makes no sense in many contexts.

And it advocated avoiding the term ""combat"" (as in ""combat disease"") because of ""violent connotations.""

The NYT article made the very good point that the language guide claims to advance ""equity"" yet makes no mention of universal healthcare, which the AMA opposes, or abortion rights.

If you really want to be inclusive, just ditch the female version of the words. Everyone can be a Benutzer, like in English. Or ditch the male ones for all I care.",1647374999.0,28

It's often why churches in Black communities have an outsized influence--if you're raised in an environment where your family isn't there to support you, places like churches will. 

For example--say you have a job interview. But you need a ride? Can you get one? If you have social capital, it would be nothing for you to call up your parents or a nearby friend to make it work. But if your ""social capital"" is small or nonexistent--what are you going to do? There are alternatives, but they're often expensive and/or hard to arrange. 

It's also one of the ways in which the decline of things like churches, fraternal orders, etc, can have a negative impact, because the internet's not going to help in this sense. If all the friends you have live across the country, they can't help babysit your kid. It used to be if you needed advice--""Hey, anyone know a plumber?"" you could ask that after church and get a good recommendation. Today? Hope your plumber has a great SEO!

If we are lactating through them (I have no idea if this is possible or not with hormone therapy, it would be awesome if it is possible though!), are we not still breastfeeding then?

Also, apparently breastmilk is a bad term now as well? Again, because its apparently gendered. Again, how is this the case? Men have breasts (I though I was going crazy so actually looked up whether they are medically called breasts for men, and men do in fact medically have breast tissue) so if they produce milk from them is it still not breast milk?

It’s upsetting that I see women who talk about how this doesn’t sit right with them, and people will say things like “sounds like someone who lost to a trans person”. When Pistorius was going to run, they did many tests to make sure the legs designed for him to run didn’t give him an advantage against other runners. They test athletes for performance enhancement drugs and testosterone to make sure it’s all fair game. Ignoring the fact that certain biological things could give someone an advantage is just unfair to those that have no control over these things. The more it is ignored, the more traction TERFs have, and perhaps the more that other competitors will be pushed over to that side. 

Trans people of course have a space within sports! If it’s not competitive, there’s really no point in making this an issue.

Edit:  See comments below for some dietary and medicinal reasons this can happen that I wasn't aware of.  In my case it was due to an ulcer in the esophagus, unfortunately the bleeding caused digestive paralysis so the symptom didn't show until after it was resolved.

Another Edit!:  This thread was more educational than I thought, turns out there are tons of fun ways to safely turn your poop black, like Oreos and Guinness!  Also Pepto for some people.  I'm downgrading this from ""Immediately Go to the Hospital"" to ""Check with your Doctor if This Shit Doesn't Stop.""  Sorry for anyone that I unintentionally scared.  That said, when it happened to me, it turned out to be quite serious.

Yet Another Edit!:  Per advice in comments: If it has a ""tarry, sticky"" consistency and is black, get it checked out ASAP, this is a more telltale sign of internal bleeding than the black coloration alone.  Also, if it accompanied by abdominal pain get it checked out ASAP as well.

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting. 

Basically, you don’t experience a heart attack every day, so your brain’s first interpretation of this event can be kinda wonky.  Think of it like when your check engine light comes on for something you know isn’t related to the engine 

It is called “Referred Pain.”  It goes against everything we understand about how pain signals work.  This is also why your left arm can hurt during a heart attack, but not many people are aware that other organs are innervated by the same exact nerve",1647349236.0,57

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind’s rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being “normal,” be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, “Well, now you’re just like the rest of us,” meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present “normal” self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back *(Edit: pushed back mostly using my legs, as I was in a crouched position)* and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests.

By Saturday night, the pain was too bad and she wanted to get it dealt with. We don't have an urgent care center locally so the ER is your only choice to be able to get the antibiotics.

We go in and the doctor immediately decides it's kidney stones and orders a CT. I asked if it's common to get them in both kidneys at the same time and he got defensive and said ""it could happen"". He also ordered that my wife had one of the IV access things (not sure what they're called? Port? PICC? something like that) put in her hand. While the nurse is doing that, she tells my wife the she (the nurse) isn't sure why they were doing that.

We wait around for a couple of hours, she gets the scan, we wait another couple of hours (all while wife is intense pain) for it to get read. Doctor comes in and tells her the scan shows she has a couple of small stones but they haven't started moving yet so that wasn't the issue and then leaves. Nurse comes back in, removes the IV thing and has wife give a urine sample. 15 minutes later, they come back and - surprise, surprise - it's a bladder infection.

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

IF coffee ground emesis is blood (often there is none), the blood may have been sitting in the stomach longer. Red blood speaks to the briskness of the bleeding. The same holds at the other end. Pooping black usually means blood from the stomach, but a brisk upper GI bleed can put out red blood per rectum. 

One thing to know about medicine, the typical presentation is not always the most likely. But the laws of physics still apply. Black stool can be from the colon, sure. But you’d never throw up blood from the colon. 

Getting a good history and exam on your patient, assessing the vitals, and triaging are key. Labs are helpful but the change in blood count lags far behind blood loss.

About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn’t sleep. Didn’t need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn’t focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn’t remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I’ve described seek medical attention.

It’s been two years almost now since that event and I’m still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight. I’m talking 80 pounds or so. I’ve been through a few other medications and psychiatrists and think I’ve finally found one who understands what the drug interaction did. I don’t know for sure if Im actually bipolar or if it was the drugs but I have been safely off of medication for months now and feel ok.

A level 1 character starts with 10 in each stat (different starting classes move these numbers around a bit, but also start above level 1). So 89 levels in each stat+1 (for starting at level 1 and not level 0) = 713. Even if you added the 10 starting stat points from each stat, final level would be 793, still an odd number.

Realistically a player will never reach this number, nor should they need to. For one, not every build needs every stat to be effective, meaning you can leave some of them at their base level and be just fine (a Dex melee build has little to no need for FAI/INT/MIN/STR other than minimum equip requirements, for example). On top of this, each stat has soft caps well before level 99 that make it so leveling up past them is just eeking out the slightest of gains on your build for insane level up costs. From what I've seen talked about for Elden Ring, the soft cap appears to be 60. So if you pushed all stats to the soft cap, you'd be looking at a level 401 character (all stats at 60). And finally, the level requirements grow with each new level, to the point of needing literally over a million runes(souls) for one stat point increase (compared to the very first point you spend costing you less than a thousand). This makes it so getting to max level is extremely time consuming (or requires exploiting the game, like rune duping) and becomes a goal in itself rather than something a normal player strives for.",1647378688.0,1

On the other hand it's pretty standalone world/plot-wise compared to the rest so it's not the worst idea from that perspective.

For my two cents I'd say DS1 is the way to go next by the way, if you're not playing Elden Ring that is. DS1 or Bloodborne have to be the best of the Souls games. Though there DS2 will have messed up your expectations again, DS2 is an obscenely long game with waaay too much content, even by Dark Souls standards.

Even after reading all of the tutorials multiple times, it just didn't get through to me in a way I understood. I rarely play jrpg's so I wasn't sure if it was par for the course. 

I kind of figured out how it worked about 30 hours in (because I just assumed I was playing it how I was supposed to), but by that point, I was doing so little damage that I couldn't proceed in the game without just activating God mode. I left, went and grinded for a while, building all of my magic up to 100 and still was so underpowered. 

Then I go online and see how easy it is to be overpowered by the measure of other's experience with the game, and also how important playing the card game was. I just gave up. 

I still don't know if I'm just an idiot or if the tutorial just explains things in an obtuse way.

The difficulty works in these games because it's paired with two things: high lethality, and high player expression. 

Most bosses take less than 30 hits to kill, which is really quite few when you consider how fast players attack. Fights are decided quickly - it's pretty rare for a fight to be ""close"", usually either the player has mastered the boss and wipes the floor with them or the boss one shots the player at some point. The combat is lethal, enemies kill the player quickly but players can do the same to enemies. When the player one shots a mook with a backstab or burns down a tough enemy in a single R1 combo, it feels good - and when an enemy fakes you out and rips your health apart, you feel suitably humbled.

And on the other side, the player expression in the game is huge. A parrying dagger user is going to play different from someone powerstancing greatswords, will play massively different from an arcane spellcaster, will play different from a dodgeroll spamming quality build, etc. I've cut apart bosses people were stuck on for hours, and been stonewalled by bosses that most people basically shrugged off, because how I express myself in combat - the stats and buffs and consumables and gear I use - is different and gives me an advantage over some bosses and is flattened by others.

It's fitting that this joke ~~originally came from~~ is stolen from IronPineapple, because he covers a lot of games that make this mistake in his Steam Dumpster Diving series. A lot of fans of Souls-like games think that the difficulty is the defining feature. But it's really not, the games are hard but that's because they pull their punches *less* than other games (though they still heavily favor the player). But to counter this, the player gets *way* more options than most ARPG's give you that can give you the edge over your enemy *if you know how to leverage them*. You can't have one without the other, the game doesn't hold your hand but *that's because it gave you the options that an easier game would have handled for you*.",1647374205.0,9

But sadly I fear that companies will look at the formula and miss interpret everything.

Like the lack of a quest track, or how devoided of orientation the game is to make navigating the world and finding things as rewarding as possible. I fear this will be subverted to thinking that games with bad uis should be the norm, or that lack of content = having to explore to find quests.

To me what makes ER great is how nothing is given to you for free. And you can play the game and miss a lot of amazing stuff, but the devs don't put an arrow trying to direct players to that amazing piece if content they threw in hundreds of hours creating. Instead if you find it then it just makes it even more amazing that you actually found that amazing moment or item.

I feel like ER invoque a sense of high punishment but also high reward in the sense that you need to try to get the best out of the game, and if you chose to not devote yourself to it, then it won't give everything back at you. It gives in equal proportion to what you are willing to invest I exploration, time and paying attention to what the devs created.

I might be a bit enamored with the game right now, but I honestly feel like few games have the guts to throw a player into a gigantic world full of content but hide the best away and force you to work for it. Somehow this is incredibly rewarding when the stars align and you can experience something great in this game.",1647367944.0,0

It's like playing an MMO's worth of content in single player. Something only a handful of games have even come close too, and none have surpassed. But it's also the way in which the content unfolds. Every night I log on, and it's an adventure... I might have my own goals, but I know somewhere I'll discover some giant cave I didn't even know about.   


That sense of awe and discovery is still pervasive, even over 100hrs in. And I have no signs of slowing down or fatigue.. I actually want to explore more. No other game has given me quite this same freedom or feeling. Witcher 3 was the closest example I can think of, but I think the entire map would fit in Limgrave? lol.

Most of the focus now seems to be on delayed attacks where you have to memorize the timing. Though depending on your build you can somewhat mitigate both of those by using a shield with good stability and damage absorption and be able to block most attacks where it then just becomes a matter of having good stamina management so that you don't get guard-broken while blocking. Another option would be to make a glass cannon mage build where you summon spirit ashes at the start of every fight to distract the enemy for you while you sit back and cast spells from afar.

So all things considered I don't think you'd have a huge problem with the game with slower reaction times. It may somewhat limit what kinds of play styles you'd be able to viably do but you'll always have options available to be able to reliably overcome any challenge.",1647374919.0,3

If you *don't* want to hand hold, then you need interactions that teach you how to play the game.  This is something that From is generally very good about doing.  They teach you obvious things quickly (""you're going to die, and that's okay""), but they also teach you other things (""You just got shot by an arrow.  Here's a shield.  Try not getting shot by arrows anymore,"" ""Here's a boss that isn't putting up with your rolling around shit; learn to parry or die,"" etc).

Without spoiling anything for others who don't have as much progress, there is a huge problem with quest lines in the game. One quest line gets locked if you complete an optional dungeon too early.  Too early doesn't mean you do some speed run skips or warps, it literally is just arbitrary. You can progress and most people who don't look at guides will just follow the path thats open to them and accidentally lock themselves out of it. 

Did I also mention this questline has a bunch of items(weapons and armor) locked behind it? It does and it frustrates me that you can lock yourself out of it. I'm fine with this style of thing if it was a choice(x or y questline for dungeon), but you can literally do everything if you hold off on x until y is done. Its not a choice, its bad design. 

Not to mention, some npcs early in the quest tell you that the quest isn't morally good. Most people might shrug that off since its a Soulsborne, but new players might think ""Hey, I should do this quest line after the other one since it might have permanent negative effects"". It doesn't.

I get that you don't need every item to have fun in the game, but that should be up to player choice, not player knowledge. FF12 had a more extreme version, if you opened any of a certain amount of fake chests, you literally couldn't get the best spear in the game. These chests were randomly dispersed throughout the game and the game didn't telegraph and say ""Hey if you open certain chests, you might not be able to get x item"". This isn't nearly as bad as that, but it shares the same element of frustration due to a player not googling everything. I'm lucky I became obsessed with the game early in my playtime and came by this fact. Otherwise, I might have locked myself out.

So whats the solution? Either don't make the questlines you are locked out of lock you out of items(for example, you could have an alternative way of obtaining the items), make it a clearly telegraphed choice, or make the questline not dependent on arbitrary completion. You can easily make another npc offer a similar questline if for some reason the choice makes the original quest giver angry at you.

For anyone early on that might be deterred from playing blind by this, maybe I can give a bit of info to help. If you are doing an optional dungeon(or at least one that you aren't sure of), make sure you complete any quests you want before the final boss of that dungeon.",1647369538.0,7

1. Balance. It's pretty poor thanks to the open world both in upgrading and natural progression.
2. The final third. It's absurdly difficult in bad ways, not ""fair"" ways.
3. Reused assets. Much like all open world games, if you need to reuse that many assets, shorten the game instead of doing the opposite and padding it.
4. Boss design. The movements themselves and the difficulty feel worse than before. My #1 complaint is the lack of ability to punish, mostly with the main story bosses. I think BB, DS3, and Sekiro blow ER out of the water with boss design. There's zero flow and some of the actual choices are baffling. Shit like Radahn and Malenia don't even seem to have been playtested. Then add shit like how about midway through the game, the game gets lazy as fuck and just starts spamming gank fights with previous used enemies.
5. The open world. It's empty. I'm kinda baffled people are claiming it's dense. It has no more weapons or enemy variety than something like DS3 which is obvious much less smaller. Exploration isn't really worth it if you like your current weapons and/or ashes. Like I don't miss collecting BS collectibles just for  shit achievement, but the world is quite barren. It doesn't feel lived in at all.
6. Side content. I know this is FromSoft's thing but if you're gonna have a 100+ hour game, you need something other than combat. There's nothing other than combat.  Other open worlds like Witcher, Horizon, Oblivion, etc. don't add random content like side mission, parkour challenges, mini games, puzzles, etc. because they're padding the game. They know that if you're gonna spend a long time on something, it's nice to break the flow. That doesn't exist in ER. The exclusive thing to break flow is exploration, exploration that leads to more combat.
7. Side missions. Keeping the same side quest style as Souls/BB/Sekiro is just dumb. You can't be as obtuse when you're switching from 20/30 hours to 100. They don't even have a log.",1647369020.0,2

Yea the final part has been hard but I also had low vigor so I just invested in Health and I was good to go there's plenty of ways to get tons of runes for leveling. 

Compared to many other open world games I've played this game doesn't reuse nearly as much. Sure it's less exciting when you fight the same enemy or boss again but one the reused bosses are pretty much all optional meaning your expectations aren't as high and two there's so much unique locations and enemies that the reused stuff isnt as bad. I can't think of another open world game with this much distinct visual variety and enemy variety. 

That boss point is super subjective and for me and many others it's just learning attacks or using the right tools no boss has really seemed unfair just some take longer to learn than others. 

I don't understand how you think the world is empty there's so much stuff all over the place and the lack of objective markers makes it better to explore it isn't that stupid checklist style of open world. If you're not willing to experiment and try new load outs than it's your fault the rewards are boring for you. Respecing is easier than ever and you can't blame the game when you're refusing to change how you play and try something new.  

It's a souls game and you're surprised it has souls gameplay im for one glad they don't just add a bunch of open world bs and stick with what they do best and do that one thing well. 

Yea there's no quest log and it's a bit annoying but the side quests I do solve on my own are super satisfying. These game are vague and obtuse so the community can discover things together and it's that which makes these games so enduring.",1647370598.0,1

Nothing stops you from just not beelining straight to whatever meta gear you can grab to trivialize zones.

As far as reused assets go, there are a few annoying examples but the majority are overblown. Erdtree guardians and the rot beasts are definitely the worst examples. Crucible knights are another frequently listed example but I feel there's enough variety amongst the variants to defer that complaint.

Your complaints about the bosses are too vague to properly respond to. The only thing I can see is ""the windows of opportunity are too small"". This is just a case of the git guds. You're not supposed to be able to nuke them down in one or two combos like many bosses could be cheesed in past games. The new design is intended to make the fights as a fight instead of a quick comp stomp.

As far as exploration goes the map is certainly larger than it needs to be, which is why you get a horse for travel. The point with exploration is that every point of interest has something worthwhile. Not that it has something for every build, or for every playthrough. Just skip it if you don't want the loot.

Most of your listed examples just have checkbox collectibles aka garbage filler content. Obviously if you like checking boxes then you'll enjoy games where boxes are being checked, but it has no place in Elden Ring's setting, nor does it fit the gameplay.

>I hate hate hate Elden Ring's lack of a quest journal (not a quest marker mind you) for one simple reason:

Oh yeah, when it comes to quests, I hate FS's approach. Especially since the NPC's are incredibly cryptic and don't give you enough details to easily figure out what you're supposed to do. I don't even bother doing the quests because I don't wanna have to follow the wiki to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.

I mainly mean in regards to dungeons and landmarks such as the Erdtrees and legacy dungeons.

I did it's still not balanced. For instance, in my first playthrough despite following pretty close to what the game gives you in terms of progression, I'd be stuck at like +10 weapon for 10 hours. I'll find one missing stone and shoot up to +17. I had this happen twice and have seen others with the same. Also, the enemies really aren't balanced land to land. Take the run of the Erdtree to the dragon to the twinblade dude to the beat priest. All in Caelid, all were massive jumps compared to everyone else. Same as the dragonrot dragon. The difficulty spikes are all over the fucking place. Also, Runes are not balanced at all. You get very little in return despite each area.

>As far as reused assets go, there are a few annoying examples but the majority are overblown. Erdtree guardians and the rot beasts are definitely the worst examples. Crucible knights are another frequently listed example but I feel there's enough variety amongst the variants to defer that complaint.

This is contextual. I'm not complaining about variety. I'm complaining about people claiming ""around every corner is something unique"" and shitting on other games in the process to make it seem like FromSoft isn't. Also, I just kinda disagree. After about halfway through there's major issues with variety.

>This is just a case of the git guds.

No. That's not a case. I've always despised this defense. The crux of FromSoft is no artificial difficulty. Getting two shotted on a 60 Vig build at the end of the game and enemies that do not allow punishes is not fair and balanced. More bosses than ever feel like luck. Also, git gud has a limit. I mean with this mentality, literally any shit game should not be criticized, literally just perfect a boss fight even if it takes 7-8 hours. There's almost no flow involved in bosses.

>The point with exploration is that every point of interest has something worthwhile.

I keep seeing this and it's a straight up lie. I don't need 50 fucking ashes and mixed physics. Also, if the game is too big and there's so much exploration, is it worth it if the game gets boring?

>Why can't you keep a log? Try pen + paper.

They get their moisture from regurgitated food from their parent's mouths. Plain water does not have the nutritional value they need to survive, so while it may not be harmful, it is a waste of effort and possibly increases the amount of time the parents spend away from the nest. The chick's parents will not return so long as they perceive a threat is near.

The only living thing benefiting from this act is the human who felt good about themselves after projecting their own feelings about thirst and the benefits of hydration onto an animal that has no need or concept of the act that was just performed. Basically, it's self-centered behavior that only puts the birds at increased risk.

Only intervene if you find a baby either a) standing next to a dead adult female deer or b) in the same spot the next day with wrinkled ears.

4912,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1088,78152,0.95,"This is absolutely incorrect.

“Tenga” is the wrong form of “tener” to use in this case. Guy in the video said it twice, knew it didn’t sound right, and corrected himself the third time.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying “tengas”. It doesn’t change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you’re misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. “¿No tengas?” is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are “no tengas miedo” (don’t be afraid), “espero que tengas dinero” (I expect that you’ll have money), and “ojalá que tengas mamá” (I hope you have a mom).

4913,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1088,78152,0.95,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mamá"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mamá?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -》 ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mamá) es triste"" -》 ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mamá"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,3

4945,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1088,78152,0.95,"The thing is that Spanish has verb conjugations that alter the spelling of the word in slight ways according to who speaks, what is the subject, the time frame, etc., and in doing so the meaning of a phrase can change or become incoherent.

For example, compare [have](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EnVerbs.aspx?v=have) and [tener](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EsVerbs.aspx?v=tener).

The correct way to say ""you don't have a mom?"" is ""[tú] no tienes [mamá]?"" (square brackets for words that can be omitted). This is indicative present second person (you).

""[tú] no tengas [mamá]?"" doesn't make any sense because it's in the subjunctive mood, present, second person (you). Subjunctive is hard to explain, but it's a more ""what-ify"" way of talking. (I'm clearly ass at grammar theory.)

But then he says ""Donde Tu Mama"" which should be ""Donde esta Tu Mama"", the way he said it would sound like ""Where you Mom"" in english. Thirdly the way he pronounces Mama is clearly his english accent as there would be a different inflection on both syllables in Spanish. Then he seems to struggle at the end when he says ""No Tiengas... No Tengas... No Tienes?"" He's mixing up the conjugation on the verb 'tener' which is to Have.

One thing to remember is this is way before the internet was anything more than a nerd dream at DARPA, and mobile phones weren't even a thing. He achieved this fame in an analog world.  Maybe only Beatlemania was more powerful an event than Mr. Jackson, but I'm pretty sure that was limited to a few countries in the western world, Michael's fame was truly worldwide and longer lasting.

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyoncé with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded.

The radio was huge, music videos played off that, then once the internet started picking up and people could find new artists through that, it started to kill off the radio and music videos. 

The Buggles has a song called video killed the radio star, which is spot on. To be big during that time, you had to have a music video.

He wasn’t just popular, he had all of the popularity and it’s literally impossible to imagine without having experienced it. That’s a horrible answer, but it’s true. For several years he *was* pop culture. I hadn’t thought about this in forever but as soon as I saw your post I flashed back to several vivid memories of things like the Walkman that kept his tapes piping into my earholes, people wearing one sequined glove and very specifically-studded red leather jackets. Everywhere, all the time. The first POC on MTV. That was huuuge. The Beatles were big, maybe bigger than Jesus as they claimed. By comparison, MJ was bigger than god for a few years before fading slowly as times changed and he didn’t adapt in a way that resonated very well. He was still huge but as he was no longer defining culture, it seemed like he was increasingly lost in the tall grass. Then he spiraled and it was viscerally unsettling. “Cringey” doesn’t even come close to describing the phenomenon. This was still before the allegations of him doing… idk, whatever the hell he was doing at the ranch. His videos, which were packaged as equally significant as his singles, just got disturbing in an “uncanny valley” kind of way. He didn’t seem entirely human anymore and he kept drifting away from being relatable in any way. There wasn’t nostalgia for at least a decade after Thriller, if not longer. When I hear one of those classic songs now, it’s like a gift. I don’t queue him up on streaming services. I don’t think of it. It’s probably because I discovered a love for music by people like Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and even Parliament.
I think that music resonates more and feels timeless. It scratches that itch that I’d otherwise get for MJ. At MJ’s peak, though, he stood higher than anyone. No one’s been there since. Music is so much more accessible and pop culture is more tribal, so we’ll never see or hear anything like it.",1647374216.0,1

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn’t listen or watch the video because of “satan”. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church “dances’.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20’s at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that’s come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn’t miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ’s life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That’s fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you’ll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince’s unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It’s like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn’t exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don’t really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

Back then, cable was in its infancy, the internet wasn't a thing, and most people were limited to a handful of TV channels/radio stations. Something like Thriller was all over the TV and radio. And there weren't a million other options to choose from. It was  unavoidable.

There just isn't that kind of ""mono-culture"" like there was back then.",1647361187.0,26

6249,pics,[OC] I photographed this blue tit in the last light of the day.,TheTrailSeeker,1647344982.0,289,16740,0.98,"Not OP, but a few suggestions:

Use a longer lens or get closer. You can get away with some pretty outrageous high ISO if you're somewhere close to filling the frame. If you're cropping in a lot the noise becomes way more prominent.

Get more light on the sensor, so make sure the aperture is wide open and try dropping your shutter speed as low as you dare, then go even lower. Take pot-shots, you will get many blurry shots, but hopefully a few sharp ones. Lean on stuff to help stabilise your body and the lens. If your camera has a quiet or silent shutter use that. Hold your breath and press the shutter slowly. After a while you will do this automatically without thinking. (This all goes out the window when shooting moving subjects btw, then you generally need a high shutter speed, however most small birds often stay still for a few seconds at a time.)

Use single point continuous focus and most of the time you should aim for the eye or the edge of the eye. I'd recommend back-button focusing as well if you're not already using it.

Ideally you're shooting RAW and using lightroom or similar, dial in just enough ""colour noise reduction"" so that the coloured blotches disappear and leave luminance noise reduction at zero (really). Then add sharpening - again not too much it's easy to overdo. If you're feeling really fancy you can export to photoshop unsharpened, then resize to whatever screen resolution it will be displayed at, then duplicate layer and add unsharp mask, then add a layer mask and paint it so that *only the areas which have detail are sharpened*.",1647377919.0,1

Normally I shoot in situations where I don’t need to increase the ISO but it’s something I’ve been trying to figure out so I can add it to my arsenal when I’m doing shoots. 

I have a Sony a7ii and a 100mm g master lens that I really like but do to the tinted apodization lens that smooths out the bokeh it’s hard to use in suboptimal lighting conditions. Even thought it’s an f2.8 the light transmission is equal to an f5.6 lens. With my other shorter lenses I don’t have an issue getting enough light.

We don't even do this for most of the oldest and trustiest of NATO states. Putting nuclear armaments into a state that's clearly as compromised by Russia as Ukraine, that shares an incredibly insecure border with Russia and other hostile states that absolutely cannot be protected, would be massively foolhardy. 

On top of that, Ukraine having nuclear armaments wouldn't have deterred Russia in the slightest. Because just like the US, Russia has a first strike doctrine for the use of tactical nuclear weapons. And every expert on Russia and Putin that exists has made it very clear that Putin has absolutely no fear whatsoever of getting into a nuclear exchange. If we thought there was any possibility he was bluffing, we would have called his bluff and moved in immediately. 

He's not bluffing. He's itching to prove that Russia has the will to wield nuclear weapons. He's itching to show how strong Russia is. 

And if the US had nuclear weapons programs in Ukraine, don't you think they would have done a better job of hiding them? Do you think we would have let Russia invade Ukraine if we had bioweapon labs, and nuclear weapons programs laying around that would lead right back to us?

If you just apply the slightest amount of critical thinking, pretty much every Russian narrative collapses.

Russia. Bubbe. I have some bad news for you.

Ukraine can totally do that and it's all your fault.

You know how you guys did that whole Annexation of Crimea thing back in 2014 and how you're doing this cute little BRUTAL unprovoked invasion + war combo platter thing now?

See, Ukraine destroyed their old nuclear arms back in 1994, after you agreed to never invade them.

Budapest Memorandum? Ring any bells? 

It contained the following;

1. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.

2. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

3. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.

4. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.

5. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm, in the case of Ukraine, their commitment not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies, by such a State in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon State.

6. Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments.


Do you know what happens when someone who signs a contract decides to break that same contract?

The entire contract is thrown out of the window.

You've invaded Ukraine. Twice.

Guess what? You broke the contract you signed. 

You're the baddie.

Ukraine can develop all of the nukes it wants with anyone it wants. You unlocked that option for them 8 years ago.

You know what else, Russia?

China knows that you break contracts and lie. They don't care because they're using you. They do the same things too. They're doing it to you now. You're going to go broke and become their power station and their second bakery. The Chinese are going to swoop in and buy you up for pennies on the Yuan.

In a way it effectively is, but it doesn't hit the heart as hard, at least for me. 

In general character deaths don't have as high an impact on me as like, moments in fiction that so beautifully capture these huge, heavy, *real* aspects of life. 

In Vincent and the Doctor, there's so many unique, huge emotions in that scene.  There's Vincent, who, having lived his life being ridiculed and believing himself worthless, actually gets to *see* that all these learned people in the far-flung future revere his work, that's huge. 

As someone who writes, and does artsy things, that's like the one thing you truly want with your art - you want to communicate your pain to others, and have it move them and make them feel things. 

But *then* you find out that, despite that, despite changing his life, his still commits suicide, and then the Doctor revealing that, that's how life is, and the fact that it didn't change his outcome didn't make the gesture meaningless, that's also really, really beautiful. 

In commentary the writers brought up how the story came from one of the writers having (I think a sister) who committed suicide, and prior to them committing suicide, they went out of their way to give her a really nice day, make her happy, and this was them tryiing to reconcile why bringing joy to someone matters, even if ultimately it can't save them from their own sadness.",1647380144.0,1

I want to reiterate that because there's this idea that somehow it's not sexism. Sexism is why that hate circle-jerk existed: She was perceived as an uppity bitch. She was always ambitious, and somehow that made her unacceptable in a way that never mattered for any male candidates. Sure, there's some grumbling about ambitious men in politics, but nothing like what Hillary got.

As for her politics, most complaints about her were divorced from her actual stances. She was always slightly left of the center of the Democratic Party on social issues, slightly to the right on foreign policy. Which is to say, basically the same as every major Democratic primary candidate for president since 1992 — Bill, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, Al Gore, John Edwards, John Kerry, Bernie Sanders (yes, Bernie, he has a lot of bluster but his actual policy proposals are pretty similar to the mainstream of the Democratic party), Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden. All of them. The extremes that people painted her with — whether as a Reaganesque neoliberal or as a left-wing extremist — never reflected her actual politics, but were largely a post-hoc justification for hating her.

Soft power has isolated Russia so much they're fucked just trying to take Ukraine. Russia might fall apart without NATO ever putting boots on the ground.

I also feel that this viewpoint probably became popularized in Russia because it became the key way to make sure the old guard remained in power indefinitely.

again I am really high.   


 First we got to remember that secret service would absolutely try to block that from happening.    Who would (past President or candidates) tell secret services to fuck off.  And who would actually do it?

I am not a fan of republicans (see previous comments). So here's my high ass thoughts, disregard any sort of comments on giving props to either side (going backwards in time).  

Trump, no fuckin way it happens.   
Hrc, same, not gonna happen.   
Obama, maybe tell ss to get fucked, but I don't think he's going to an active war zone.   
Sanders?  Same as Obama.  
maybe Bush 2 would tell ss to fuck off.  Probably wouldn't go tho as well.  Same with Clinton and Bush 1.    Reagan was mental so absolutely wouldn't do it.  Carter?  Carter would show up but wouldn't go against secret service.  Yada Yada...  I am thinking that the last president that would have done it given the chance (given they were in modern times) would have been maybe Teddie.  Theodore Roosevelt would have probably said ""fuck this asshole"" and done it lmao.

""In 2021 a ruling has been delivered in a long trial where officials were accused of negligence in preparing of the flights. The judge stated that there were four parties directly involved in the flight preparation: President's Office (KP), Prime Minister's Office (KPRM), Government Protection Office (BOR) and 36th Special Aviation Regiment, and all of them, each on their own, have broken numerous procedural safeguards, which would have prevented the crash. President's Office should not have requested flight to an airport that was legally closed and not ready to accept such flights. Prime Minister's Office should have not accepted and proceeded with President's requests, as it was not compliant with existing laws and procedures.

Holy shit… where do I even start?

His head of staff Yermak has (had?) close ties to Russian business and Kyiv shady business. He’s been filling their ranks with likewise awful people, E.g. Tatarov, an ex police guy who could be the symbol of police corruption, and his duty in Z office is controlling all of the law enforcement structures *via any means necessary* (read: corruption and threats via a network of personal connections and Z backing him up). NABU has a case against him and a few other people, we’re talking some ₴70M charges, against a guy taking care of law enforcement for the president…

Talking of nabu (national anti corruption agency) and SAP (specialised anti corruption attorney office) - they’re fucking hated by old and new guard alike, because those guys are not fucking around. NABU head's contract was meant to expire somewhere around now, and there’s a due process of selection a new one involving 3 committees from our government and 3 from international community. International guys were pushing for the best candidates, while our guys were pushing for the one controlled by Tatarov, dragging the process on every corner as hard as they could. It started over a year ago, the winner (a good guy) was clear last August, but they still haven’t approved the results under straight up imaginary / false pretences that have nothing to do with actual laws. Note that Z has personally and multiple times pledged to grandpa Biden that this process will be finished asap, for months on end, and it wasn’t finished.

Same process is meant to start for SAP, and they’re already doing the same fucking shenanigans.

Head attorney is a straight up evil woman with connotations of ussr/tsar times, and with her rhetoric she’d be a better fit for Russian law enforcement, but she does the dirty work for Z, so her own pace is secure.

There’s a “court” in Kyiv - OASK - that by law is the only institution that can take cases involving in any capacity any state state institutions. There’s just too much dirt about it to put into a single post, but just two things to paint a picture

- both Poroshenko and Z pledged to end it, both instead been using it for their advantage; Z's law draft to remove it been sitting in Rada for over a year- while his party has a sole majority, something happening for the first time in Ukraine

- NABU leaked lots of shit from there, and one phrase I still remember, said by head of the court to Poroshenko's aide when the court took a decision favouring then-candidate Z: “lmao, have you ever had any doubts in our political prostitution? We’ve been waiting for a long time to strike you back”. Sigh…

Head of SBU is Z‘a childhood friend that has nothing to do with law enforcement until being given place of head of SBU. Do I even need to elaborate?

And finally, for the last two years, defence spendings were jeopardised due to incompetence, malice, and different priorities from Z - building roads and shit. Our budget for building roads was like x2 or x3 from the entire military spending on paper, much more in fact due to military money not always being utilised. Now we don’t have much anti air capabilities and the roads are destroyed anyway; never mind the press reports of 20-40% of the roads budget being stolen.

His party in parliament has a lot of questionable people or outright traitors to the country. Or had, to be fair, they’ve done some cleansing, but it’s hard to forget.

I think I can keep going for a while, and he’s been in politics for just 2,5 years.

———

That being said, I’m positively impressed by how he handles the situation, and societal consensus right now is to stand by our president and our army. Have no doubt, all of the above won’t be forgotten, but he’s been primarily elected for being an actual human being, not a politician, and it is so much easier to follow someone like that in tough times.",1647380748.0,1

I agree that if Zelensky were, somehow, to be discovered to be a war criminal, his support would dry up.... but as long as it's *Russia* claiming that Zelensky were doing such things, it wouldn't matter *even if it were true* because only Russia's allies would believe them anyway (And again, those allies are also willing to believe whatever random untrue nonsense they spout, so no real point for them to make things more believable).

8223,worldnews,Polish PM says he has arrived in Kyiv,TR_2016,1647368258.0,509,4358,0.99,"That’s kinda literally what you’re doing though when you reduce it to “Russia’s side will believe Russia and Ukraine’s side will believe Ukraine.” These are not the same, because Russia has started an actual war and is lying constantly and consistently about it. Obviously Ukraine is going to want to present a narrative that’s in their favor, but the majority of what they’re saying is being actively checked by other intelligence agencies in addition to the actual evidence we are getting in the form of videos, pictures, eyewitness accounts, etc. There’s a lot of different and not necessarily collaborative governments and organizations reporting on what’s going on and overwhelmingly they’re seeing Ukraine’s “side” as being far more consistent with reality than Russia’s. So it’s not really an equal situation where a “both sides” argument applies. At worst, Ukraine is exaggerating. At best, Russia is deeply deluded. 

Like of course we wouldn’t trust Russian sources, they’re proven liars to an extreme degree. Of course they could sprinkle some truth in there, but their bias is obvious, it makes sense to distrust their perspective on a matter that directly involves them. If corroborated by other news sources then it becomes more believable, and people will adapt to the new information. 

Again, I really just don’t see these as equivalent. In the U.S. at the moment the overwhelming majority is in support of Ukraine, but there’s a range of opinions on what exactly to do to help. This isn’t the same as the much more uniform indoctrination we’re seeing as a result of Putin’s propaganda machine. No one in the U.S. is being jailed for not being pro-Ukraine or expressing ambiguity or indecisiveness in who they support or how. The freedom of discourse has lead to conversations and debates that simply aren’t being allowed in Putin’s Russia.",1647381079.0,1

Some classics were dealt rough hands, As you mentioned Toy Story, When the 3rd movie came out and it ""ended"" I thought it would be great if they remastered the 1st in the style of the 3rd. 

We've seen it in games, a remaster of an old classic with a modern update. Some movies deserve that treatment.

Go to my friend's house and the TV is off? Hit ""Power"" and Kung Pow is already playing.

Walk in the door? 
""Weee-oooo-weeee-oooooo-weeee!""

Come in from the pool?
""We intentionally trained him wrong as a joke.""

Come up stairs from the gaming TV with Street Fighter or DDR?
""OK. So here were my options. A. Quickly duck sideways, dodge the claw, then take him out with a spinning back-kick or... B. Take the claw in the face then roll on the ground and die. ""

And my buddies' dad loved it.

Hell, any person I've befriended, no matter their personal interests, have loved Kung Pow once introduced.

Its continually play time was only usurped 2 years later when Napoleon Dynamite came out.

I had to do some serious soul-searching when my buddy's parents moved a few years later. That place was everyone's home.

And to give props to my best friend's dad, He's the first person who made me realize that adults don't really grow up. They still love poop jokes, juvenile humor, dumb movies, and playing ping pong or basketball for hours.

I watched a video about Asian made films gaining mainstream popularity in the west, and western studios starting to cater to the Chinese market.

These films are obviously going to have little international appeal.

Kung Pow though, it's just a dumb comedy riff on wuxia kung-fu, which many older Americans have memories of watching on public access. I think that person is looking too deep into this. It's also 20 years old.",1647375574.0,1

Everyone here is writing other factors that may contribute to depression. But COVID-triggered depression is weird or, better stated, different on it own. I have had depression from external and internal factors, and fighting to not go any further with my new covid-triggered depression. The big difference between both is that, and this is anecdotal, the first one, it’s kinda just degenerating state over time that you can back track from traumatic events, but covid-triggered is way different it is like you are one person and then just like that you are grey (to me it took just about 1 week to descend into a depressed state) it just happens. 

I had a not severe, mostly asymptomatic case. But one of my doctor’s colleagues committed suicide after a two week severe case, recovering and months of treatment for depression (at the moment diagnosed as PTSD).

Many key limbic and paralimbic structures are affected with COVID: orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate, temporal pole, insula, and amygdala. If this bears out, it is no surprise whatsoever that people are experiencing increased anxiety, depression, and worse. Those structures are directly related to emotion and regulation of emotion.

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.  

ICU delirium significantly contributes to injuries in the hospital setting and increased length of hospitalization and can result in PTSD, depression, and personality and/or memory changes that persist after the hospitalization is over and delirium has resolved.",1647360852.0,59

Say what you will about some of the terminology used in this description of the ""pain body"" which really resonates with me, but in my experience, this has been useful.

A tl;dr version could be: hurt people hurt people (including themselves)

Or: misery loves company.

""
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, “become you,” and live through you. It needs to get its “food” through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. 

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn’t really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane. 

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don’t face it, if you don’t bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn’t make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth — that is, make it real in your own experience. 

So the pain-body doesn’t want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength.""",1647367015.0,4

If you're expecting politicians to be good sources of information on matters of vaccine science, I can't help you there.

Edit: It's also worth pointing out that these vaccines *were* very effective against the original COVID strain and even against Delta so someone talking up the vaccine's capabilities and effectiveness certainly wasn't wrong back then. In the time since then, though, Omicron happened and now some dishonest debaters are holding those words against them even though they were said well before Omicron was even a concern.

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,14

“So, according to the study, pornography-viewing alone doesn't lead to sexual dissatisfaction. It's only when men expect real-life sex to be like porn that problems arise.

There are a couple primary ways to counter this. For one, comprehensive sex education for teenagers and young-adults should instruct students about the unrealistic, performative nature of pornography so they can understand what they are viewing when they almost inevitably watch it. That way that can approach their own sexual exploits with proper expectations. Second, consumers of pornography can seek out, and the industry can produce, more realistic pornography which depicts consent, actors with more 'average' bodies, and respect for female partners.”",1647377081.0,1

I remember Comedy Central playing a comedy where a man was raped while sleeping by a woman and his girlfriend walks in, and assumes he’s cheating on her. He was literally blacked out drunk and was raped on screen and this was “comedy”. No wonder so many millennial men hate women and can’t figure out how to date them, when their formative teenage years was filled with this trash or anime. Neither of which are particularly great at displaying that women are humans.

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape. I can’t help but wonder why this is even an option when someone reports sexual assault, in the same way I wonder why so many men think stalking is a way to win a woman back. It’s literally been built into our entertainment for generations to normalize these horrifying behaviors.",1647362419.0,13

The development of technologies to slow climate change has been identified as a global imperative. Nonetheless, such ‘green’ technologies can potentially have negative impacts on biodiversity. We explored how climate change and the mining of lithium for green technologies influence surface water availability, primary productivity and the abundance of three threatened and economically important flamingo species in the ‘Lithium Triangle’ of the Chilean Andes. We combined climate and primary productivity data with remotely sensed measures of surface water levels and a 30-year dataset on flamingo abundance using structural equation modelling. We found that, regionally, flamingo abundance fluctuated dramatically from year-to-year in response to variation in surface water levels and primary productivity but did not exhibit any temporal trends. Locally, in the Salar de Atacama—where lithium mining is focused—we found that mining was negatively correlated with the abundance of two of the three flamingo species. These results suggest continued increases in lithium mining and declines in surface water could soon have dramatic effects on flamingo abundance across their range. Efforts to slow the expansion of mining and the impacts of climate change are, therefore, urgently needed to benefit local biodiversity and the local human economy that depends on it.

Findings  In this cohort study of 29 621 adults, being overweight and having classes I and II obesity compared with having a normal BMI at a mean age of 40 years were associated with a statistically significantly higher cumulative morbidity score and health care costs across older adulthood. Age at death was similar in the overweight and statistically significantly younger in the classes I and II obesity group compared with the normal BMI group.

Meaning  This study’s findings suggest that overweight status beginning in midlife is associated with long-term adverse health and economic consequences in the context of similar longevity.

Importance  Abundant evidence links obesity with adverse health consequences.

Being overweight or obese increases the odds of bad outcomes. If you do have a bad outcome you'll likely be a little bit better off than if you were lighter going in, but not enough to offset this. 

I would want to check how they handled males. Men who are ""overweight"" (BMI in 25-29.99) usually don't have much more fat than men in the ""normal weight"" group, the difference is mostly muscle. This doesn't hold for females though - it's more likely to be from fat.

 screens prior to its premiere. Fox was promoting the hell out of Brisco  
 County. 

 It's first Friday night was a 2-hour episode, the next Friday   
night, there was a ""UFO special"" on Fox after Brisco County, the third   
Friday night, Sept. 10, 1993, The X-Files started its run.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

  
 I used to work at a graphic arts company and our shift was 2p-10p m-f.    
Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

Sam could just show up in a scene, crack wise or do a few cool things, and then fuck off back to drinking mojitos and chasing cougars.

I'm not sure if the character would have worked well in the lead. The movie they did was good enough, but weekly plots where Sam has to pull the weight of the narrative every time? Half the character's charm is that he scarcely ever gives a shit and is game for hijinks basically whenever, but a lead character has to be more invested than that.

Sam Axe has a constant ""I just wanna' go home"" energy whenever he's the focus of the plot, which is fantastic in short bursts, but wouldn't hold up to scrutiny in a spinoff where he's the perpetual focus. Character would have to change a lot to support it. 

Otherwise the viewer would constantly be asking ""why the hell is he even doing all this right now?"" else the writers would have to give increasingly flimsy excuses why his character isn't just fucking off and going home. In Burn Notice, he was always in the game for Mike and Fi or one of his buddies' sakes in a ""Sam's Buddy"" episode. He was always game to help people out, but he was rarely the one *seeking out the needy* and, in the absence of Mike's magnetic hero reputation, wouldn't be going out looking for wrongs to right. And the obvious answers, like ""Sam has money troubles and has to take jobs to pay for his new car or something"" makes him seem less sympathetic than his previous ""Sam is flawed but supremely loyal and good-hearted"" portrayal in Burn Notice.

He's too much of a ""minds his own business"" type to get into adventures without other characters like Michael or his cavalcade of buddies dragging him into the weekly shenanigans. And a ""Sam's buddy is in trouble every week"" formula wouldn't last very long, unless you focused an entire season on one single ""case"" and one well-characterized and developed long-term buddy. You'd need either a radically different weekly formula, or some inciting incident that turns Sam into more of the weekly-hero type (and an incident of that nature would run the risk of stomping all over the lightheartedness of the character, since ""they killed my wife and now I want revenge!"" or the like would ruin the ""fun"" of the character.)",1647362283.0,9

The network also pushed for more interpersonal conflict and the cromags as a 'big bad guy'. They drove the professor out & replaced him with a playboy playmate.

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?

Electronic Warfare aircraft gathered info such as SAM locations and RADAR frequencies and that was used in conjunction with flying modified target drones to bait the RADAR stations to light up and paint targets and the Wild Weasels did their thing.

Also there was extensive RADAR jamming by US/coalition forces which lead to the famous video images of tracer fire lighting up the sky but not aimed at anything in particular in response by Iraq forces.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

Then they flew both the F105F and then the F105G. The F model flew with external electronic warfare pods. The G models had their electronic equipment stored internally on both sides if the aircraft. 

They flew as hunter killer teams. One aircraft flew low and slow trolling for SAM sites. When a site came up the hunter would lock on the Radar signal. The weasels would fire either an AGM 45 or AGM 78 missile. Some times the radar would stay on too long and the missile would guide down and destroy the site. Even if the site was hit an additional aircraft would fly down and destroy what was left with bombs.

Other times the radar site would shut down and the missile would go ballistic. Without guidance from the radar site the SAM would either run out of propellant and crash or just blow up without damaging our aircraft.

Either way, the attacking aircraft would be safe. Then again on their way out the Weasels would keep the sites from trying to shoot down any more aircraft.

It was very dangerous and quite often one would be shot down.

The motto ""YGBSM"" came about when the Weasels were first told about their mission. One of the pilots stood up and said ""You got to be shitting me"", hence the YGBSM. The standing joke among us maintenance people who worked on the Thud Weasels was our motto ""YGTBSM"". This stands for "" You got ta be s××tting me"".

In electronic warfare. The pilot needs the AA battery to turn their RF systems on (like radar and RF guidance for missiles) to geolocate their position, submit it to the rest of the forces, then counter attack *likely before the AA battery even fires*

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

At least some of the torpedo bombers had air cover. The problem was that the technique the USN was using at the time sucked.  
Some examples:   
The Enterprises fighter squadron VF-6 was providing cover for Hornets torpedo squadron VT-8 (VF-6 had lost the group of planes it was intended to cover and had basically 'latched' onto VF-8 instead). The issue was that the USN plan was to fly ""high cover"", so the USN fighters were high and the bombers were low, and as a result the USN fighters didn't do much (anything?) to interfere with the Zeros.  
When Enterprises torpedo squadron came in while VF-6 was still in the air and still ineffective.  
Yorktown's strike actually came in together, with the fighters (VF-3), bombers (VB-3) and torpedo aircraft (VT-3) arriving together. They went in as a single strike but one of the ways Japan had of dealing with their CAP being drawn away was keeping 'ready' aircraft on the decks which could be launched to respond to new threats, so by the time they came in the USN fighters were massively overmatched in number (6 USN fighters vs 40+ IJN fighters). VT-3 was also screwed in that they ran headfirst into the fighters chasing down the departing survivors of VT-6. 
  
> The Devastators drew the carrier's Zero cover downwards and they didn't have time to regain altitude when the other bombers arrived.  
  
VT-6 was also the only squadron that really had any effect at drawing the cover downwards, as they actually went in with other attacks. The other torpedo attacks were so early that there was plenty of time for the Japanese CAP to return to altitude. The idea of VT-8 (or VT-6) bravely sacrificing themselves to draw the CAP down is a myth that was created to try and pin a purpose to the slaughter of the torpedo squadron.",1647360789.0,2

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week. That is simply not enough to compete with NATO's level of training and barely enough to keep their pilots proficient. NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

As for why they haven’t equipped drones with HARMs, I’m not actually sure — Israel, India, and Turkey use the IAI Harop/Harpy 2 which is a loitering SEAD platform, so it stands to reason it’s well within US capabilities.

SFOD-A: A Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or ""A-Teams""). Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO, high altitude low opening), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.).

The movie [12 Strong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong) which is based on reporting by [Gary Schroen depicts their role either as forward observers, trainers, or other operational activities.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Schroen)

The CIA needed ODA teams on the ground to direct airstrikes. 12 strong illustrates roughly how that was done, including coordination with the CIA to bribe local warlords and removing MANPADS with large amounts of cash from Afghanistan.

SFOD-B: The ODB, or ""B-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11–13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field.

Note: Any time you read ""direct"", picture in your head shooting at the enemy. Direct fire = point and shoot. Indirect fire = artillery, mortars, fire from an unseen adversary.

SFOD-C: The SFODC, or ""C-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals, and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies.

SFOD-D: SFOD-D, or Delta Force is comprised of soldiers recruited from within the US Army's 75th Ranger's Regiment and the other occupational detachments. Strong focus on counter terrorism, clandestine operations. Generally works closely with the CIA's SAC/SOG.

Suffice it to say, Delta force are usually made up of former Green Berets. Functionally, due to the expected clandestine nature of their role they are separate but SFOD-A/B/C/D are all still under the command of JSOC and USSOCOM.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.  I was reading a few days back a thread of people who'd tracked cruise-missile launches by planespotting the rockets from cellphone cameras and CCTV back to the launch corridor within minutes.
