I high school I took drivers ed and one of the vehicles we had to drive was a Rambler with a 3 on the column. Everyone in the classes had to drive that old car. After that a 4 or more on the floor was easy.

Then there was the old, and I mean really old small truck we had at my summer job. I worked at a lodge in a national park in a neighboring state one summer. There was this old truck that was a floor shift which was really the easy part. The hard part was that there was a choke that had to be set just right or you would flood the engine or it would refuse to start. Seems that old truck liked me as I was one of the early arriving staff and drove it to get supplies to all the cabins as we cleaned and opened them for the season. One day I was waiting tables for breakfast and got called outside to the truck. All the guys from the garage were there along with all the housekeeping staff who were trying to get to their assigned cabins. No one could start the truck. I got in, set the choke, and started that old truck right up. Seems they had flooded the engine but, while they waited for someone to get me from the dining room enough fuel had drained and setting the choke properly made it just turn over right away. I did not let any of the guys from the garage forget that a 19 year old girl could start an old truck that they could not.",1647296549.0,146

It has a choke, spring brake chambers on an air brake system that won’t release until it builds pressure and hit a button under the dash.  It has reverse where most manuals have first. The 5 speed transmission has almost no synchros and the shift linkage is stupidly complex which makes it very vague. It has a two speed rear axle just to confuse things further. 

If they did manage to get it rolling it maxes out at 55mph absolutely wide open at the engine’s redline.  You could almost keep up with it on a moped. granted it can still do 55mph while hauling 14,000 pounds.

lol

OK... it wasn't stolen. And it technically wasn't my first stick ever... I grew up on a farm where having access to stick was a norm so I'd been introduced to the concepts in a growing form (note that tractors and the sort have very different transmissions so don't match 1:1 with a car's tranny).

But the day that I learned to drive an actual stick, all on my own with no assistance, was when I was around 12. My dad was a truck driver who hauled cars. And I'd ride with him all the time to ""spend time"", or to just travel. Like if I was going to visit him in Florida for the summer, I'd ride in the truck rather than fly.

Well he was moving a porsche down for a friend of a friend on heavy discount as a favor. And the guy was being a total dick bag about it and was going to stiff my pops on the money because he thought he could get away with it due to the relationship that tied the 2 together (lets just say my dad was in some unsavory side business back when he was alive).

So my dad was going to have to eat the loss on this one.

Well, while sitting in the palm beach auto auction where he was unloading the rest of his load. He tossed me the keys to the porsche and said:

""I think it's about time you learn to drive stick.""

For 2 hours I drove around that auto auction lighting that clutch on fire!

In my experience it's usually the people who hill hold and the people who constantly rest their foot against the clutch when they're not shifting. Hill holding is absolutely awful for your clutch and is a bandaid for people's inability to do hill starts without rolling back, and the foot resting there often turns into slightly riding the clutch 100% of the time without noticing. Lot of people also constantly rest their hand on the shifter (I call it Vin Dieseling) which tends to cause unnecessary synchro wear. 

Granted I'm a big dickwaving manual transmission elitist who learned in a manual from day one of driving, but as far as I'm concerned the clutch on a street car making stock power and doing standard commuter duty is functionally a lifetime part.

That's not the only reason valets are used.   

Some times the parking lot is small and you can't fit all the cars into the spaces (i.e. cars need to be blocked in).   In those cases a valet has access to all the cars keys, and can move cars as needed to get them in and out.

Other times valets have specific lots they have access to as well for parking cars.

Sometimes it's simply convenience rather than laziness.   You're at a hotel, you're checking in, you have bags.

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren’t appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don’t we spend more time with them, why don’t we go out more, why don’t we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don’t do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven’t done it yet, I probably won’t ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,38

When I was completely alone at the house I went for the gun and sat down, thinking about it. In my mind at the moment, I couldn't find any reason not to do it, so I pulled the trigger. 

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"".

and for us to be alive to experience life and understand it in a way no other species can (even the most sentient creatures, like, does a chimpanzee know that we're hurdling through space on a rock and there's billions of other galaxies and shit? no i don't think so) - is pretty incredible. call it creationism or a byproduct of evolution, but.. like we're here. we're here alive, knowing it, experiencing it, learning about it, etc. it's pretty incredible. it's so meta that, evolution/nature designed a species (us) by accident through billions of years of trial and error that could end up understanding itself. humans are like the mirror of life being able to see itself instead of just living as itself. 

i suffer with anxiety and depression and OCD. i'm definitely not normally this awed by life. i mean LIFE in an of itself is incredible. but the human experience is fucking tough and depressing and difficult to deal with. i'm convinced at this point that knowing all we know about life is a CAUSE of mental health issues since most people will experience mental health issues at some point in their life. it comes with the territory of being human and having a human brain. part of the human condition, if you will.",1647291483.0,3

Understand this. An accident outdoors is believable and means your family and friends will be sad but nobody thinks of suicide. That is important because if they did, the pain is much worse and goes on for decades.

The risk as you say is remaining alive with a broken body. People do not always die in a fall which makes this a problem.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,830

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off “just over a block” from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn’t recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn’t have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn’t find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it’d be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn’t call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn’t ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn’t believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn’t have money at the time, so I didn’t want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they’d release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I’d been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I’d been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn’t have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

He evidently discovered the phone video of me and her doing the deed and proceeded to post it on her FB page. 
I started to get texts/ calls around 7pm from friends, then her close friends. Was insanely embarrassing and heartbreaking at the same time. I was in a bar within the hour trying to calm down. 

Since said video was not (because of the angle) breaking any FB decency rules and her being passed out, it took until 10-11am the next day before it was removed.

Everyone from her hometown was bugging him and me (most thought I posted it, at first) as to where TF she was.

When I didn't want to take any of the available classes, he got the principal to approve a class (Sociology 3, in case you're curious) where it would be just me in the class and he ""taught"" it. I didn't have to do shit but hang out with him for an entire period and got an A. Solid deal.

Well, I graduated at semester and he bought me a grad card. He'd filled every single blank space with tiny writing about how much he loved me and couldn't he just keep me. If he couldn't he was feeling like he would kill himself. 

As I type this now, I'm getting creeped out but at 17 I was too naive to see that for what it was, and I'm only giving you about half the story here. Anyway, that's my crazy friend story. Last I heard he quit his job of 20+ years after I graduated and moved to CO. Idk what happened to him from there. 

EDIT: ok, I'm getting some messages about elaborating on this. To be clear, I don't have any trauma associated with the situation.

The relationship started when I was 15. I went to a tiny rural school and even then I stood out in a crowd. Not a brag, it's relevant to understanding how this all came about. 

The teacher was in his late 40s. Never married, and as I learned later, never even had a girlfriend. Very quiet type. I was going through some things at home and I needed a trusted adult. I was drawn to him and confided several things to him, and he was a true friend when I needed one. You can simultaneously be very beautiful and very lonely, as I learned early in life. I took to spending a lot of time in his room, just talking, playing on the chalkboard, nothing more. 

The next year our talks turned to boys, and he tried to give me some advice about not falling for the BS that high school boys do to get in your pants. He was very critical of boys I dated, always pointing out flaws and such. I started driving that year and that put him on edge because he didn't always know the boys I went out with personally. He was constantly asking if I was ok, was I comfortable doing what boys and girls that age do...it seemed like he was looking out for me, protecting me and I believe he was.

I visited him at his house, but he didn't make advances or anything. He did call me in the evenings and weekends quite a bit. He had a stuffed bear I'd given him which he named after me, usually he'd call to say he and ____Bear missed me. 

My senior year was when we had the 1 on 1 class but again it was just talking although by that point we were so close people noticed it. I think I knew he was in love with me, but he never touched me except for a hug here and there and never asked for anything that would make me uncomfortable. 

Other than the card, he never did anything odd. We confided a lot in each other, and we were two people who needed one another at the time. If I had to do it again I'd make the same choices. I remember when I read the card being deeply sad and sorry for him that I couldn't return the kind of love he had. For me he was a dear friend and nothing more. I remember him fondly and hope he's well, wherever he is.",1647297807.0,269

1) Ex held me hostage in a hotel room for two hours by physically assaulting me and preventing me from leaving. She stole my phone and laptop and tore the hotel phone cord out of the wall so I couldn’t use it to get out. I refused to fight back so I just took a beating including having a whole ass pizza thrown at me. I finally got out but the cops were only interested if I hit her back so when they found out she didn’t (after endless questioning all about MY response) they didn’t give a fuck. 

2) ex tried to kill herself in front of me after we broke up. She told me she would kill herself if I didn’t go to her place, so I called her parents and told them what she said. They asked me to just go check on her, against my better judgement I did. After screaming at me and trying to push me down a flight of stairs she ran into the kitchen, broke a glass, and started slashing her wrists. I had to tackle her to the ground and pinned her there and then used a free hand to call 911. She was screaming that I was trying to kill her while on the phone with dispatch, but she eventually stopped. Luckily the cops could clearly see what had happened when they arrived and they didn’t hassle me over it.

3) Most recent ex and the reason I’m not dating for fucking ever, been dating for 4 years, all is well in our relationship, plans to get married. One day she grabs two of our cats and ran out the door with them while I cooked us dinner. Drove away. Doesn’t answer phone. Two days later I hear from her parents that she texted everyone we knew that I had been physically abusing her for years and that I had illegal weapons and that I threatened to kill her with my guns. Her parents called me because they knew that’s not me and warned me to get the fuck away from her for my safety. Turns out she got committed to a mental hospital after her friends realized what she was saying about me wasn’t true and that she was truly having a psychotic episode (lots more to this story). She had told her friends my deepest secrets breaking so much trust and my heart. I had to explain to people that I wasn’t a murderer or abuser and it was awful to have people I love and care about even for a moment believe the worst about me. Cops got called on me by my friends but for some reason they never showed up.

Yknow, because i was ""nice"". That gave her about three weeks. I went on an impromptu road trip with my buddy about two weeks into it and when I got back, she let me know she had moved out while i was away, so about a week prior.

When I got back to my apartment, every single thing I  owned was piled up, in the center of the living room. This isn't an exaggeration. The apartment looked ready to rent to new tenants, except for the massive pile of furniture, collectibles, clothing, medicine cabinet contents, food from the fridge and pantry and since it was June...fucking MAGGOTS!! It took a week to really sort through. I kept finding more fucked up stuff, like my childhood teddy bear, ripped at his neck, so his head just dangled there, 25 year old stuffing, bleeding out.

She claimed she was pregant early on. Then when she got a formal test at a doctors office, the results were somewhat convoluted. Especially compared to my friends wife who had a test done. Hers was very direct. Name, date of birth, blood type, pregnant/not pregnant with thr signature od the doctor at the bottom.

Some would ask, well how did you not know if she was lying? I moved a couple of hours away and had no vehicle. But I fully believed that she would birth a child out of spite for me.

I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving. 
This all happened after she did the following.
1) called me hundreds of times from a dozen numbers to which I blocked and requested she doesn’t call
2) egged new girlfriends car
3) tried to get me to do threesome
4) tried to make me fuck buddies
5) asked a very desperate friend of mine to prom hoping to get in our group
6) followed me to work, home

Two years later, I have a new phone number and am I’m college. I get a call and answer it. It’s her. No idea how she found me. She asked if I went to the local university to which I replied yes. I did not actually go there, I went to a state college. She enrolled in that university. 

That’s the end of that story",1647309017.0,3

I called the police and told them I had been robbed. When they got there the landlord said he let her in. Her name is not on the lease.

They had been married for six weeks when he came home to find her gone. She’d taken everything except his clothes — curtains, furniture, wedding gifts, everything.

Their wedding vows were for “as long as the love shall last” instead of “til death do us part.” Someone had asked me after the wedding how long I expected the love to last, and I predicted six weeks. I was not happy to be right.",1647315736.0,1

Yeah I had a BPD ex who had manipulated the neighbors to see her as the victim and myself (peace loving hippie adjacent at the time) some kind of monster abuser.  Long story short she ended up breaking into my house repeatedly as I slept **even after I screwed all the doors and windows shut from the inside.** Finally after MUCH trouble, drama, courts, and a restraining order, she stopped coming around.

Surprisingly, no matter how much evidence came to public light, people have a hard time mentally exonerating someone they believed was evil and accepting someone they thought was some poor sweet victim is actually sadistically mentally damaged and dangerous.   At best, many people would kind of ""split the difference"" and just assign some manner of truth value to ALL claims and accusations about BOTH parties, no matter how contradictory or mutually exclusive.

He didn't leave. He didn't give her up for dead. Because his VA benefits were shit, and wouldn't pay for a home health care aide, he was her sole caretaker for the last two years of her life.

My priests were lovely. Couldn’t fiddle kids because there just wouldn’t have been time in the day with all of the actual humanitarian work they had going. If they had been bad people. 

I remember once being 14, drunk, at a house party at 2am where I felt uncomfortable. I couldn’t call my mother, because I lied about where I was that night and didn’t want to get in trouble. 

I needed to get home but had no idea who to call. For some reason I had my youth pastors number, even though I had only gone to youth services once or twice. 

I called him and drunk explained; and he was there in 5 minutes, in sweatpants and clearly just out of sleeping. 

He went through the drive through coffee place and got me a coffee and then talked with me on the 30 minute ride to my parents house. 

It never once felt judgmental. We didn’t talk about god or the Bible per say. 

When I apologized for calling him (despite hardly knowing him) and cried for feeling bad, and cried that my moms Jewish, so I’m not even sure if I’m allowed to ask his help, he nicely told me that it didn’t matter how often I skipped church. Or youth group or if I believed in anything, Old Testament or new. 

That he took the job because he wanted to prove God in the way he was meant to; by being a Good Samaritan and caring about people. And he didn’t mind losing sleep, because bringing me home safely was what Catholicism is about; doing the right thing. 

He never brought it up again, but when I saw him he would greet me warmly and ask how I was. Even if I was a random kid off the street that didn’t have a religion really. 

Some people are just called for that kind of work, and don’t mind living poor and doing good things for no return. They actually practice what they preach.

Yeah, if I go to a church, I should do my part to keep the lights on, but if they're telling me that I can buy my way out of whatever punishment I definitely deserve (I've done some weird shit) by buying the pastor a Cadillac, I don't go for that.

He whips out his card, laying it next to Bateman's on the table. Off-white with the words ROBERT VAN PATTEN: VICE PRESIDENT centred and embossed in black, it is basically indistinguishable.
""Egg shell, with Roman.""
Bateman smiles bitterly.
""Nice.""
Now a third broker pulls out his card. It looks exactly like the first two, except it reads TIMOTHY BRICE: VICE PRESIDENT.
""Raised lettering, pale nimbus.""
""Impressive"", Bateman mutters. ""Let's see Paul Allen's card.""
The room falls silent as the third broker produces an absent colleague's card.
Bateman speaks in voiceover.

Not sure). Salt, dried or fresh dill, rosemary, and heavy cream. Can also use a half sweet walla walla onion but with the leeks can be too much…

Sauté bacon with cut leeks in some olive oil. Salt generously. When leeks are soft and bacon crispy, put in pot with broth and potatoes. Bring to boil, keep on boil for 10 minutes or until biggest chunks of potato are soft. Turn heat down before next step.

Using slotted spoon, pull out about 1/3 of the potatoes, put in blender with 1 cup heavy cream, blend until smooth. If heat is now simmer temp, add blended potatoes slowly back into broth (while stirring) with dill and rosemary. Simmer at medium to med-low while stirring for 15-20 minutes, longer with lower temp (but you MUST keep stirring or the cream will curdle and while it doesn’t change the taste much the texture is nasty)

I see a whole bunch of suggestions here, which seem way too premature for the state the game's in. I wouldn't recommend doing anything related to progression, realistic damage, and stuff like that before you figure out the core gameplay loop and make it even more appealing. Progression should come later to complement your gameplay. Lots of other stuff recommended here should come even later.

➡️ close fast combat (melee) / seeds1 poison *3

➡️ midrange  sword like (root blade) / seedgun2

➡️ Heavy class (in video) big range ground attacks and punches, (root shield) tanking enemy explosion etc (big shield) 

# ▶️ Long range weapons

➡️ *1 *2 shooting seeds etc. to turn humans in ""real non living trees"" (dead trees). 

➡️ *2 seed like rifle or slingshot for a seed bomb having a big range explosion of flowers (roses to impale enemies) 


# ▶️  Attacks

➡️ Small: Fast stabs, quick spin, small throwable seed grenades (spawn many colorful flowers (acts like a stun / smoke grenade to disorient enemies)) 

➡️ Medium: Middle swing, stab, 360° swing, over shoulder swing (slower powerful attack) 

➡️ Heavy: Big Punch, Ground smash, big root wave stamp, big seed bomb, using a tree log as heavy two hander? 

# ▶️ Special attacks 

➡️ small: poison stab*3 (turn enemy to dead tree / bush), quick 360° spin to stun enemies

➡️ medium: root punch (long range punch / maybe whip like) or both xD. Poison mid / long range attack*2, JUMP ATTACK (Ground smash heavy?) 

➡️ heavy: big root whip 360 Boi heavy and slow but powerful, seed bomb big

# ▶️ Movement

➡️ Dash, teleport (growing a clone somewhere else and the old tree just dies and falls to ashes), ROLL (they see me rollin...), jump (combine with jump attack?

If you can, I'd love to see a dissolve or rot effect added to the roots as they disappear rather than it just blanking out in chunks. 

Reactions from the humans being smacked would also not go amiss. Some minor stumble or shake, anything to lead credence to there having been an impact.

I don't mind the backhoe exploding as it does, but if you can't destroy the stone building in one pass you shouldn't be able to walk through it doing passive damage. You should bounce off, while doing damage to the structure at that point. With smacks or stomps doing damage in an AoE in front of you by comparison.

And yes, as other people pointed out, if the humans can take more than one hit, the equipment should be a bit tougher too unless you have some kind of special ability to entangle them with roots. Nature beats jenga tower technology after all.",1647314195.0,1

Thoughts:

*End of level, main character plants itself into ground and blooms, grows leaves. The less damage you took, the greater the bloom.  

*collect bird nests and small animals (eg squirrels) as bonuses. They can help you fight.

*weather effects? Wind, snow, rain, lightning. 

*have a move where you can plant your roots deep. It limits movement, exposing you to danger, but allows for unique powerful attacks. 

*Maybe a stealth level where you can hide motionless until humans pass? 

*I’d love to see some unique environment interactions like walking through electrical wires and they break and drop with sparks, crossing a busy road and cars are swerving out of the way, jumping in a river (floating?)

*Finale in a giant lumbar mill with huge saws, wood chippers, and the like. Basically a horror movie for trees. Maybe the player has to free all the trees about to get cut up?",1647312559.0,1

They arent meant to keep inside. Only time thats ok is for rehabilitation or rescue of an injured animal. They are meant to be wild. 

I love animals and the best way to show that, is to let wild animals remain wild and enjoy them in their natural habitat. 

FYI: Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other forms of direct contact with infected squirrels. Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid. Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease, Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. - googled information.",1647282736.0,8

(Actually I remember this discussion coming up separately on reddit once, of whether or not funk is rock.  To me it is, at least...)  If your definition is funk, you'll be surprised by New Wave.  If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

Hell, a lot of those early soul groups got their start as doo wop groups like the Miracles and Marvin Gaye started as doo wop artists. Otis Redding even took a lot of influence and began as a Little Richard imitator and if you listen to see some slower Little Richard songs like Send Me Some Lovin' sounds like soul.

The Nixon admin thought it’d be a safe bet, because he played old boy, country music and wouldn’t have to worry about all the anti-war criticism being leveled at him at the time for Vietnam. Nixon hated the hippies and their anti-war sensibilities, so getting a show by good ol country boy Johnny Cash should have been a safe bet.

But the band itself has so much synergy and comraderie, it's very inspiring. You can tell they love playing to the audience. Just a fun band to watch overall. I've got a newfound respect for what they do. Not to mention, they've been around since 1975. That's impressive on its own.",1647282612.0,20

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that.

We know this isn't true, though. The same factors that caused them to be radicalized by right-wing conspiracist nonsense are the factors that prevent them from recovering from that spiral of radicalization.

The ***overwhelming*** majority of the time, once a person is radicalized, they will remain radicalized for the rest of their life. We don't know a way to reliably de-radicalize people at scale. The only intervention with ***any*** observed success is to engage them in painstakingly patient conversation over a period of months or years, and even then the likelihood of that working is depressingly low. It's a difficult truth to accept, but it simply isn't worth trying to rescue radicalized people. Once they're radicalized, all you can really hope to do is limit the harm they can cause by isolating and marginalizing them so that they are prevented from radicalizing anyone else.

If you want to fight right-wing radicalization, the way to do that is to prevent vulnerable people from becoming radicalized in the first place. That means ***dramatically*** increasing funding for public education, and relentlessly supporting crucial democratic institutions like the free press, voting rights, rule of law, etc.",1647291409.0,6

B) but more importantly, because there is a very obvious right and wrong here. Russia invaded. Ukraine defended. Russia has given no evidence to show why their invasion of a sovereign nation was justified. Ukraine is defending their country, which is justification enough to fight. Russia has committed acts that go far beyond the constraints of war (bombing hospitals, breaking negotiated ceasefires, etc). Ukraine isn't attacking Russia, and is indeed treating Russian prisoners decently by all accounts. If Russia gets to annex Ukraine, it has wide reaching implications for other sovereign areas that Russia would like to reclaim, and eventually for the world. If Ukraine maintains freedom, no one is threatened but Russia, and even then only because they want to take over Ukraine.

So even if we believe that Zelenskyy is actually an awful guy, that doesn't actually justify Russia attacking the country. Especially knowing what we know about how Putin has run Russia. The Russians suffering over this isn't a strike against Zelenskyy... it's another against Putin.

However, Downtown Houston and particularly Downtown Dallas both have pretty good walking scores. Downtown Dallas was a bunch of deserted office skyscrapers when I lived there but I hear it has gotten better.

EDIT: Since people are getting confused, Houston and Dallas being ranked 24th and 26th walkability score of large American cities is a VERY BAD ranking. The website is saying that Dallas and Houston are car dependent and UNWALKABLE. So everyone replying saying, ""That website is wrong! Houston and Dallas are terrible to walk!"" Yes, that's exactly what the website is also saying. The ""downtown"" neighborhoods that have decent walk scores are pretty small areas of both Dallas and Houston which are only a handful of blocks large.

The crime in that place is insane too. Just assume your car is going to get broken into on the regular in most neighborhoods.

Then it's 100°+ in the shade everyday for like 5 months. They get a winter now though for maybe a month which they are still not prepared; no infrastructure really and stores don't stock much for ice removal or anything like that. 

During the freeze last year we were standing in line to cut up untreated lumber to burn, for the few that could skid down the road to the lowes. I think we were out of propane too. I found one small tank and used a blow torch to defrost drain pipes. You have to drip faucets all winter so they don't freeze but during the power outage, that froze up the drains. 

Anyway, we're closing on our house there soon hopefully and already left for good. The power outage and the following pipe bursts was the final straw on an already broken back. 

Fuck Dallas and most of Texas and the whole Texas State government and US Congress idiots. They get what they voted for now. Good luck.

Of course, every year the Texas legislature outlaws more and more of the restrictions we place on business.

New buildings are using painted Styrofoam for their outer cladding.

Million-dollar houses have replaced most of the plywood with cardboard. When it gets torn up in the wind before they put up brick they literally duct tape it back together.

Anyway, I had to come up with the messages and my night maintenance guy changed the letters on the sign for me. He hated the sign more than all of us combined.

The result of a request posted  by a user on r/estoration a couple of days ago. I took a few minor creative liberties here and there in spaces where I could not figure out the exact details of the original or in areas where I could not find a 100% replacement HQ part for it .. or in some cases where I just felt minor changes enhanced the result but did not deviate much from the original.

Hope you all like it. :)",1647252160.0,1024

Here are a few of the reasons for that feeling:

- the sweater pattern is mechanical and all aligned, which wouldn't be the case on a real sweater

- the sweater and shirt both feel composited in, and the shirt is both in and out of focus

- focus drifts and disagrees at different points: for example, her ear (and neck) is out of focus but the hair in front of and behind her ear are both in focus

- the coloration of her face is splotchy and transitions abruptly from olive to rosy and back again",1647258472.0,57

Remini has already been discussed, but I am unfamiliar with it (I imagine it's similar to DFDNet). Recently with stylegan2 some interesting ideas have been implemented. One with particular promise is time-travel re-photography in which the latent space is queried for a similar looking face to the input image, and then the AI face is converged toward the input image.  

[AI Comparisons of this face](https://i.imgur.com/W6bUmq0.jpg)

However, I think that it is important to colorize photos, especially in a historical sense. Most people's historical reference point starts with their birth. When they see a b&w photo of say Ruby Bridges as a child being escorted, the technology to produce the original photo gives it an ancient, 'so long ago' reference. When viewing the same photo of Ruby Bridges being escorted, but this time in color, gives the photo the right historical framework as in 'not that long ago'. 

It's weird how our brain perceives color and time together.",1647260948.0,1

1. It looks like there is a curl of her hair in the original that has been removed/confused with background plant life - would be good to add that back in as it looks a bit too clean on that side
2. As a result of this, the 'indent' around the outside corner of her right eye is also absent, giving it a less naturally rounded appearance. As a result it looks like her cheek is basically in line with her brow/forehead rather than curving in at the top.

I see that her sweater is green.  Was that an educated guess?  Was it computer-assisted? There used to be a bot here on reddit that did a really good job (by machine learning standards) colorizing b/w images. 

There is a colorized image of our fire department from the 1920s in my local bank that drives me nuts. Whoever colorized it made the New Jersey flag red instead of yellow. Although, it's also clear that it was done before modern computer tools.

So, is there a tool that says a given item/object is most likely a certain color, based on how grey it is compared to items in the image that are certain?",1647263597.0,1

* The sweater looks like a rug texture has been pasted there

1. Fix any photo damage and over exposed areas.
2. Expand the image for better composition and fill out the areas that need to be. I did that in this case but ended up replacing the entire background anyway coz there was barely anything there.
3. Remove noise as much as possible while trying not to wash out information in order to be able to used later.
4. Spend hours trying to find the closest high quality replacement from stock photos for all the facial features / skin / hair / and other stuff in the photo.
5. Spend more time trying to morph and blend them all to match with the original as much as possible. Improvise when there's no information. Spend a lot of time on this step because the more accurate you can make it, the better the final result will be.
6. Do a base color coating on the entire image.
7. Study the materials in the image and try to overpaint on all of them trying to replicate the material effects -- glossiness, refraction, reflections, specular detail, subsurface scattering for the skin and transparent materials and etc. The more time spent on this, the more realistic the final image will be.
8. Add noise and some intentional photo distortion to make it look like a photo and less like an overpainted image
9. Get lazy after all that work and find hackjobs for less important areas coz it can get tiring.
10. Do a final color grade / lighting fix / overpaint to fix anything that stands out too much.
11. Save and post to reddit.

Here's a WIP GIF of another restoration I did a while ago. This is not the same kind of restoration work as the OP ..but it does kind of outline my process a bit. This one is missing an entire overpaint layer that I now do for skin and etc. [https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4)

I mean, there is a picture there of people farming in bright red shirts! Lots of color wasn't just some luxury thing in past centuries, it was as normal as today. Obviously we have more choices and ways of imparting colors, but people regularly wore colorful clothing in the past too, all over the world. And decorated their surroundings in bright colors. Black and white photos are great, because the alternative is almost entirely either nothing, or portraits of the rich. The portraits do show us the colors they had available, but they are biased because they're being paid for, and they create bias in us because the only color we see is worn by the aristocracy. It is also part of the reason that I like Vincent van Gogh's work - he shows how things of his day *felt.* You can look at his work and know what it was like to be where and when he was and it is beautiful.",1647269908.0,111

Oddly enough media depicting ancient history often is more colorful and bright, and there is a far greater spectrum ‘life’ happening. It’s not until the middle ages that things are just…monochromatic.

Fantasy novels especially fall victim to this narrative. This dark and dreary monochrome world where everything is just glum and horrible.

Restored, Reframed, Enhanced and Colorized by Me.",IDoArtForYou,1647252152.0,1205,84801,0.88,"I think it is about my transformative years.  The change in my world from 0-10 may have been incredible from a scientific view, or an outsider's view...but for me, it goes from being a kid, to still being a kid..  From 10-20, though, enough personal change happens that it could easily be broken into multiple time/emotional groups.  From 20's on out...my views have changed, my circumstances have changed, my lifestyle has changed...but in perspective, I still feel the same person.  So time doesn't feel as impactful.

So things that happened 10 years ago to me, feel very much like they could have only happened last year.  The passing of time just doesn't hit as strongly.  There is little difference from one year to another.  (Taking out huge milestones like the pandemic, 9/11, etc...just considering day to day events)

But as a kid, each year or two years brought about a lot more change.  So time and individual time periods had greater impact.  So that is my perspective on passing time, where I felt it having more of an impact in my life.  During that time, 50 years prior was the 1930's.  Intellectually, I know that is now nearly 100 years ago...but emotionally, it still feels that same 50 yr period as it did when I was coming to terms with life and everything about it.

Time is definitely relative.  And perception becomes one's reality.",1647266035.0,11

Then again, the world does change faster and faster. Take a kid back 30 years and they'll be confused about phones, no internet, no touch screens etc. Take a 1940 guy back 30 years and they'd be quite familiar, I guess. Things would just be a little more quaint.

""In short, Anonymous hacktivists have succeeded in gaining access to Rosneft Germany’s servers and tapping large amounts of data.

In the process, they penetrated very deeply into Rosneft Deutschland’s systems. So deep, in fact, that they easily found backups of employees’ and executives’ laptops.

As far as the backed up data is concerned, one simply has to be satisfied with the nearly 20 terabytes pulled last week. Included are complete hard disk images of employee laptops and computers, hard disk images of a mail server (34GB), many archive files (ZIP, TAR.GZ and 7Z), CSV, XLSX, DOC and of course software packages, manuals, license keys for software, and – because everything is Microsoft Windows – thousands of DLLs.""",1647289890.0,6140

I'm actually starting to think that Putin's fuckup is gonna be a huge boon to the world.  

Renewed support for democratic regimes. Hacktivists fucking up asshole companies. More support for renewables over fossil fuels. The sheer joy of watching Putin's army get spanked.  The fascist right in America losing a hero.  Even watching shills debase themselves (Scott Ritter, Glen Greenwald) to the point of absurdity has been illuminating and helpful.

However, money that goes into weapons to defend themselves against egotistical madmen is also money that could've gone into medical or educational budgets.

I blame the bald demagogue on Russia who wanted his name on history books as a russian unifier.

If you have a specific target as a part of contract, it's specific and it's hit/miss almost randomly, sometimes you can't get anything really at all and sometimes you will own a complete state-wide network of a huge insurance company with admin access in 2 days in 2 person team.

If you don't have a specific target, it's much easier ""to hack something"", there are so many targets. Also you will only report the successful hacks, not the unsuccessful ones. So behind huge hack there have been many other attempts at other things. It would be just too boring to list all the things you tried and not newsworthy (hence why pentesters hate writing reports). If you made a real movie about it, mostly it's a lot of sitting and almost mind-numbing trying like 99% and maybe 1% action.

7187,worldnews,"Anonymous hackers hit Russian oil giant Rosneft, secure 20TB of data",MorgrainX,1647289850.0,1775,59721,0.94,"I have seen industrial security. Multi billion dollar outfits where massive havok could be unleashed with proper access.

All old crusty badly configured VPNs which haven't been upgraded in years, operating systems which haven't been upgraded in years. VMWare so out of date it is hard to get modern OSs installed on it, and so on.

From what I could see they had three layers of security:

* Old odd software which is unlikely to be in the average kali like toolkit.

* Such weird configurations of VPNs and networking that it is easy to get lost even when you are invited.

* All running on hardware which the average toolkit/hacker is not going to be super familiar such as VAX/VMS (yes in 2022), Solaris, HPUX, etc. Usually, a mix from many eras. Some old servers/networking gear from the 90s or before and everything inbetween up to and including some new local cloud stuff. Often each of these upgrades was because they bought something new which wouldn't run at all on their old style crap. So instead of upgrading everything they would shove a few new servers in with the new stuff and the let it sit and rot. 

As for good practices like honeypots or even backups these places are swamps of bad IT so nothing like that. I am not exaggerating to say some of these multi billion dollar operations could be down for days with a single drive failure. Often they have redundant systems where ""backup"" server is just corrupted junk because the system making it redundant failed 3 years ago. Their attitude is to put it on a list and not worry as the ""good"" server is fine right now. Even better are those redundant systems where if the master server corrupts it will probably happily corrupt the backup servers. The backup servers which don't actually have backups.

Best part is if you ask them about their security they will brag about it being impregnable. ""Three layers of VPNs. Firewalls, secure server rooms, multiple redundant everything."" This is a case of where they don't have a clue of all the things they don't know.

Also, quite a bit of their stuff is very custom built. Thus installing it can be involved and highly hardware dependant. I have seen industrial installations where the guys installing it have the source code open in visual studio working on a live system.",1647306636.0,2

For instance, one laptop could have a 2TB image, while that image only has 250Gb of data and 240GB of it is system files. And I frequently work with single email accounts that are larger than 34GB. And seeing that it was a whole mail server under 34GB, that leads me to believe it's either very old, or it's not actually an image of a whole mail server and only a few targeted accounts from it. (But is named to appear to be a whole image, which has yet to be confirmed/verified content-wise.)

In fact, there's a very good chance that what they obtained was the data related to a single legal hold that was being handled in relation to a lawsuit and discovery request. I say this, because I've handled dozens of scenarios where the source data is pretty much exactly like this from a client. Also seeing that most of the archives and collections were made and stored here around the same time period (September 2019 through February 2020) it's very clear this was actually being compiled for a reason.

A DLL is a non directly executable binary file which holds the compiled contents of a library of functions (code). They are specific to Windows and are started by various processes including Windows itself. They make it possible build applications out of existing building blocks by using an existing DLL. In contrast to a .DLL is a .LIB which contains uncompiled code, a text file (usually headers). One major benefit of DLL is that it’s compiled independently on the application depending on it. That means the DLL author can ensure the optimization instead of passing that to the consumer. Another perceived benefit of DLL is that it’s harder to reverse engineer and is often times used in conjunction with obfuscation. This is not really true for anyone smart or dedicated enough though.

There is arguably potential value in having the reverse engineered DLL source code of this oil company. Just conjecture but I could believe it.",1647307064.0,2

If people refuse, as a culture, as a society, to acknowledge the truth because they think it has no value then the truth dies. And propaganda, totalitarians, etc know this, they intentionally spread the lie that the well of truth has dried up so that no one goes to it. We should be mindful of the spread of this attitude that truth has no value and doesn't matter. If a person doesn't think pursuing the truth has any value or isn't worth it, they can die ignorant without me. I'll *always* take knowledge and value its importance for understanding the world.",1647304023.0,2

Here’s the thing, anyone that is truly paying attention already knows the overall answers. Everyone in my life that follows politics and has for many years connected the dots and will hardly talk about it now or unplugged completely because it’s too fucked up to deal with and no one who can do anything is doing anything, not even calling it out.I mean plenty of academics, sociologists, political scientists have called it out but no one with enough power to fix anything has stood us and said the plain truth: 

*America we’ve were compromised by Russian operatives and assets and for four years they had the keys to the kingdom and of we don’t stop it we will collapse.*

So the thing is, if we saw it all together, in writing, with  undeniable proof, would we do something  or just go back to Netflix? Shouldn’t the Panama papers have started a world wide rebellion? 

My extremely educated uncle mentioned the other week how so many of the biggest mouthpieces have been outted as fascists that want to install a dictatorship and work with Russia like it was the first time he said it out loud. I looked at him and said “yeah we and our kids are going  to have to kick ass( our kids are adults) and he just looked at the ground and said “I think it’s too late”. There were probably 7 or 8 highly political people in the room (family funeral) and not one person said a word. That moment scared me more than any other so far. Even my young adult nephews that have masters in history just stared ahead. 

Are we too tired, too afraid, too beaten down? Are we just so demoralized by 50+ years of fighting in good faith with people that not only aren’t using good faith they use every dirty trick in the world to put on a pretend play while literally driving their supporters into madness. And also, who exactly is fighting on our side? Anyone?

No.

Those sites are just a way to make advertising revenue off of people's ignorance.

People get a ""Cannot find Entry Point..."" error and lock onto the dll and figure ""ahh! Of course, I can just replace it with a newer version!"" they do a google search, land on dll-files.com or whatever, and oh, good! there are 20 different versions of gdi32.dll (why the FUCK do they have that file at all?). Well, they pick one and then they go down the rabbit hole of forcibly replacing gdi32.dll on their computer and make it unbootable. 

or, taking the old game example, maybe the error is that mvscr90.dll cannot be found.

So a user google searches and oh look, lost-dll-files.com and dll-files-for-less.com and dll-files.com and free-dll-files.net and who knows who else has it for free download! Surely,  that is the solution right?

No. The ""solution"" is to install the Visual C++ 2008 redistributable.

or maybe the error is that ""mfc42u.dll"" could not be found. Same story. Except you need the Visual C++ 6.0 redistributable.

Hell, just looking into that specific game and I'm finding shitloads of bad advice. Dinput.dll missing? oh, here, download this random fucking zip file and extract it.

Like, no. Just install DirectX 9.0c.

Trump basically stole their plausible deniability. He took all the racism and ignorance that was always there, but neatly tucked away, and put it center stage.

Eventually, humanity returns to its base state, racked with disease, starving from famine, slogging through the mud killing each other over whose god is stronger.

And the reason they are so concerned if you're dishonest is not because they want to be sure they know everything about you.  It's because they don't want you to be blackmailable.  If you won't talk about it when background checking for your job, then if someone external approached you with info about it and said they would tell your boss and cost you your job and probably worse unless you gave them some innocuous-sounding intel, you probably would.  Obviously you might not give them the nuclear launch codes but that's not how shit really works.  They don't ask for recognizably dangerous information until after forming a relationship with you based on that initial foot in the door - they wait until you're so deep in it that they could nuke you completely if you stopped cooperating.

What you said is important and maybe exactly right. If y’all want to fight, I’m here for it. I’d happily go out fighting fascists, the one thing they have never been able to take is the humanity we have and they lack and they know it’s something they want to destroy but can’t even identify. I can live with this ending even if we lose but the idea that we just sit and get absorbed into the fray is the most depressing thought I’ve ever had. Seriously. Nothing is more depressing than humanity just rolling over. 


This conversation makes me think of one of the funniest books I’ve ever read, written by Mikhail Bulgakov while he was living in Stalin’s Soviet Union (his wife was able to only publish it 25 years after his death) , people think these people we deal with can’t be evil because they are stupid and they do and say ridiculous things but Mikhail said all fascism is that way.

That Independence was won through a violent struggle against imperial Britain, followed by a bitter civil war.
Irish people fought and died in many of Britain's wars.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90’s.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

And just look at The Fellowship of the Ring! That is a gory ass movie. Had the Orcs and Goblins been humans it would've been a hard R, but because they're fantasy creatures that bleed black it could be PG-13.",1647311622.0,33

""Hey, hey, my grandfather died two years ago, and he wasn't evil.""

""Well, this tree is also possessed by the Deadites, but trees are naturally scary to begin with.""

""If you say so. So how are the demons going to appear? Are they going to be red and have horns? Make up and costuming is expensive.""

Sam raised the money for E.D. himself. Most of the money came from dentists and folks like that Sam convinced into investing. 

Sam, Rob, and Bruce got that film finished with a stolen camera from the university of Michigan, gallons and gallons of Karo syrup, and pure determination. 

From everything I've read and seen, there's no indication Sam had any other version in mind when he filmed E.D. 

After the small success of E.D., Sam decided to redo it. But all the Chosen One stuff and Annie and all that were things Sam came up with much later. Hell, Scotty is the hero of part 1. Not Ash.",1647314515.0,3

9041,movies,"Disney+ to Release Sing-Along Versions of Animated Classics, Starting with ‘Encanto’",MarvelsGrantMan136,1647294453.0,194,1472,0.9,"I'll just say... the billboard Top 100 is not a consistent metric of determining popularity.  It's not like it is rated just on sales.

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,21

I could only conclude that he was flexing that he holds racist views to appeal to his target demographic. Perhaps by representing such an extreme view he could graft himself a die hard fan base perhaps?

That is literally all I can think of...the age old 'race grifter' rearing his ugly head is the only thing that makes sense.Think about it, someone has to sell the bed sheets to the Klan. We know these people are out thereRacist people still consume television and Peele is happy to cash in on it, I guess.

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

Capitalism was introduced as a test and…it worked, for those it intended to on top (aka the greediest of humans), the rest of society (lower 95% of humans that make less than $200k/yr) will fall into decay decade after decade while believing corporations and politicians are looking out for their best interests.

>Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property. ""I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew—at least they claimed to be Communists—couldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.""

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

They know next to nothing as a rule about their own history, or the histories of other nations, or the histories of the various social movements that have risen and fallen in the past, and they certainly know little or nothing of the complexities and contradictions comprised within words like “socialism” and “capitalism.” Chiefly, what they have been trained not to know or even suspect is that, in many ways, they enjoy far fewer freedoms, and suffer under a more intrusive centralized state, than do the citizens of countries with more vigorous social-democratic institutions. This is at once the most comic and most tragic aspect of the excitable alarm that talk of social democracy or democratic socialism can elicit on these shores.

>An enormous number of Americans have been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than, say, Germans or Danes precisely because they possess far fewer freedoms in the concrete. They are far more vulnerable to medical and financial crisis, far more likely to receive inadequate health coverage, far more prone to irreparable insolvency, far more unprotected against predatory creditors, far more subject to income inequality, and so forth, while effectively paying more in tax (when one figures in federal, state, local, and sales taxes, and then compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country, as almost nowhere else, their taxes do not cover). One might think that a people who once rebelled against the mightiest empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services. But we accept what we have become used to, I suppose. Even so, one has to ask, what state apparatus in the “free” world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens while providing no substantial civic benefits in return, solely in order to enrich a piratically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the immensely wealthy?

I’m certainly not rich but I grew up with absolutely nothing and live a very comfortable life now. 

For some context, I was raised by a single parent who was a disabled Vietnam vet and unable to work. While he did get a VA disability check, it was only a partial disability because of an arm injury. His real disability was PTSD resulting in a lifelong battle with alcohol. He was later classified as fully disabled but that was after I was out of the house. We lived in a single room shack that was about 15 feet by 10 feet. My father slept in a lazy boy and had a cot. There were no appliances. We had a microwave and a fridge that was about 2 feet by 2 feet. We mostly didn’t have running water because the bill wouldn’t get paid. 

I had ok grades in high school and went to an in-state public university. I was able to afford it because tuition was really low, I got grants, some student loans, and worked. I did ok on my GPA but nothing stellar by any means and graduated with my BBA in finance. I immediately got a job out of college making a very good salary. 

I worked in that job for two years and then went back to a different in-state public university to get my MBA with a concentration in financial analysis. Again, being in-state and public, the tuition was quite reasonable. I did ok and got decent grades. I also passed the first two levels of the CFA while in graduate school. That wasn’t an expensive designation to pursue. 

When I graduated, I immediately got a job making almost three times what I was making before. I’ve been at that same company for over 15 years. Now, I make three to four times the amount I did when I started. 

None of this was that difficult (except the CFA). I didn’t go to top tier schools, I didn’t have a 4.0 GPA, I didn’t go into serious debt. It was so damned easy to DRASTICALLY improve my situation. 

My wife basically did the same thing. She grew up above the poverty line but not by much. She went to the same schools I did, got her Masters in accounting, and went to work in audit at a big 4 firm. She got grants and student loans, and worked. She did much better than me with her grades and wouldn’t have been able to land that job without that.

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

So... what are we supposed to make of this? We can't be lazy and pull a hand wavy ""well nobody wants to work hard!"" because that's nonsense.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,50

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

Part of the problem is that idea of upward mobility means different things to different audiences.

For me, as someone who grew up in poverty, I see small positive changes as upward mobility.  I see someone going from making minimum wage at Walmart to working trades for $60K/yr and being able to afford a nice house in the suburbs as upward mobility.

For others, making minimum wage at Walmart is the same ""class"" as a tradesman, or even a doctor, and thus moving from one income level to another is not upward mobility... that upward mobility can only be acheived if one earns enough wealth to not have to work, or if one goes from not having to work to their children not having to work, nor their children's children.

Regarding myself, I make over 3 times what I made in 2018. Though I feel bad cause I just dug them a bit deeper since we now make too much for cheap healthcare, and one of my mother’s recent raises caused her to actually make less money due to getting upped a tax bracket. 

Granted, if my grandparents and aunts and uncles weren’t sometimes there to babysit, take someone to the hospital, or let us hang out at their house, I’d be willing to bet things would be very different.

Look, I’m not trying to give you a hard time, but look at the people you surround yourself with. If none of the people you surround yourself with are successful or in a socioeconomic spot that you’d like to be in, change your group of friends. Network with people you’d like to be like. It doesn’t mean you’ll be in the billionaires club, but you can at least hit that six-figure point just by networking, I promise.  People hire and work with people that they like. Get out there and sell yourself. What talents do you bring to the table? Are there unique characteristics about you that you can leverage? 

Lastly, do not for a second think that you deserve anything. Get that thought out of your mind. If you’re mad that other people are more well-off than you are, guess what, that makes you the asshole.  You’re spending your time, your valuable time on this planet, in this life, being upset about what others have. Let go of that.  Only then can you truly realize incredible success. Because the less you think you deserve, the more you’ll be willing to do to help others. It is through helping others that you will find success for yourself.",1647306129.0,-3

I've got a friend, initials DID, who grew up in a trailer park to first gen Trinidadian immigrant parents who speak with heavy accents, so zero privilege. In 5th grade, DID's teacher thinks he's pretty smart and he should do an international baccalaureate (IB) preparedness program at a magnet middle school (harder middle school classes to prepare for harder high school classes). DID convinced his parents to sign the forms, which they only do because the school is a magnet program so he'll be added to a bus route and they won't have to take him to the miles further away middle school.  
  
During 8th grade, DID does all the paperwork himself to get into magnet high school with the IB program. DID excels in the IB program and gets into the nearby state university (now a top 10 public university) on a variety of scholarships and grants, which he researched and applied for all by himself. Never received any financial help from any family members.  
  
At the University, DID meets eventual wife, who is premed. Travels around the country with her for med school and residency. Works at several advertising firms along the way. After residency, moves to Jacksonville, FL where wife takes job at one of the hospitals and DID founds his own online advertising firm. Now DID makes like $300k/year and his Dr wife makes more and they live in a huge house like 6 blocks from the beach.  
  
That covers the work ethic and up by his bootstraps point. Now the natural intelligence.  
  
DID has 4 siblings. They're all short sighted, immediate gratitude, poor decision making, in their 40s and still working menial jobs BUT as far as I know (known DID since 6th grade) not on drugs or with criminal records (so it isn't like they got into the system early and had additional barriers). The only one who doesn't live in a trailer park near the parents, check to check, is one sister who married her HS boyfriend who eventually became a Ford dealership manager after working there like 20 years and lives a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  
  
Those 5 people grew up in the same home, all born in the USA, none had noticeable accents, and all went to the same schools outside of DID choosing basically on his own to go to the two magnet programs. All of his siblings suffer from dumb people issues like lack of logic and inability to prepare for the future. The only explanation is DID being naturally smarter than his siblings.",1647305935.0,0

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

>Values have been adjusted for **purchasing power parity** and take into account both the payment of **taxes and social contributions**, and transfers in kind received by households (such **health** or **education** provided for free or at reduced prices by government).

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

Most of the people screaming ""Europeans have a stronger middle class"" base it on inequality measures and not as much on income thresholds. Holding every western country to the same, HIGHER standards used in the US makes just about every country not named Norway(1/2 the population size of Los Angeles county) or Luxembourg (~9x smaller than Norway) look worse. You can also compare those tiny countries to US states that are relatively rich (e.g. Massachusetts and Maryland).",1647299787.0,25

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

Hard work is more than a little part of it.

I grew up lower class, on the line between paycheck to paycheck and needing food stamps with both parents working.  

I went to the Navy straight out of high school and ended up with a non service-related discharge within 2 years at zero fault of my own (both I and the military had no idea I had a blood condition until my environment drastically changed).  I dont get military/VA benefits.  I wasted two years and had to start over when I got out, and when I got out at 20 my parents were in a nasty divorce and I had nowhere to live.

For the early part of my 20s I was on the streets or sleeping in my car with a year expired tag, even while I was working.  I got in to bad friendships that buried me in a hole of debt from them not paying bills and rent, and got evicted even while holding down a full time job.

I met my now wife while I was couch surfing for weeks at a time, or staying at an A/C-less foreclosed house a friends mom owned but had yet to flip, in the Florida summer.  We had it smooth for about two years after we got together until we found out she had epilepsy, then everything went out the window again.  Multiple brain surgeries, weeks long hospital stays to try and find out what kind of epilepsy she has (temporal lobe), a NeuroPace brain implant, a carousel of medicines and bad reactions and hundreds of thousands of dollars down the drain even with insurance.

We've been together for 10 years now and were finally, again beginning to see the light.  I have a great job in IT that I worked my ass of for 15 years in the trenches in call centers for.  She's finished her MS and is finally able to start looking for a new job, despite not being able to drive anymore.

I've even taught two of my friends, who's extent of IT knowledge is playing PC games and fixing crashes, to come work in restaurant support with me, and now they're both Aloha and Micros Sys Admins with me.

If I say, ""Baseball is a massive exploitation machine that preys on young boys for capitalist gains""

And you then learn I have never watched or played baseball in my entire life, then that opinion would be extremely suspect and you would and should question it.

You can agree with the sentiment of the words, but obviously an expert in a field will obviously hold more gravitas.

John Steinbeck wrote several of the Greatest American novels about the poor and under priveleged. His opinion is highly valued in that field (hence why someone would attribute the quote to him)

That quote would be very different coming from a career criminal that spent his entire life trying to scam people out of their money.

Now you can like a random quote, then you can find research that supports that quote. But just blindly liking a sentiment without any research or understanding is not going to convince anyone and is more than likely confirmation bias.

Case in point the infamous fake voltaire quote, ""If you want to know who controls you, look at who you are not allowed to criticize""

This went around facebook all over the place and many agreed with it regarding censorship, the fact that Voltaire a major philosopher seemed to say it validated the idea.

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,7

The other study was modern data and you dismissed that.

The other study sucked, for obvious reasons which I explained at length. It's not my fault that the first study was so poorly done, nor that the second study is over two decades old. That's historical data at this point, not a current representation of either the US or Germany's status in 2022.

This last article you linked to (Stockhausen) is the only decent one among the three. It seems to analyze relevant data, although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. It's not nothing, but it's also not very much in absolute terms.

Oddly, the abstract claims that, ""while the majority of German males has been able to share in the country’s rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground."" However, this is directly contradicted by the results themselves, which clearly indicate that well over half of American men earn more than their fathers. The majority of both American and German men are doing better than their fathers.

 Notably, this study does not evaluate the amount of improvement per individual (i.e. only the number of people who earn more, not how much more they earn), nor does it address the downward mobility included in the original study which started this thread.

Altogether, I would have to say that the results do not make a compelling case for any sort of policy guidance.",1647313173.0,1

They missed things like a much lower wealth disparity between the richest and poorest, meaning that there are fewer wealth-based barriers to moving between economic strata.

It didn’t. Your reasons were bad.

Income mobility is, by definition, a measure of parent to child. It must, therefore, span many decades. Generally at least 5 decades, often 6- enough time for the parents earnings to be captured over time, to start. Then for the child to become an adult, and then that adult child to now have a long period of adult earnings to be averaged over time and compared to the averaged over time earnings of the parent.

And it must have good data about both parent, and child, and they must be comparable.

Can you think of Any reason, any at all, why they would predominant use the data of fathers… from 50-60 years ago?

And not mothers? In the 60’s and 70’s? Any reason at all that data about women’s the earnings, in the 60’s and 70’s, might not be great for analysis of societal income mobility?


>nor that the second study is over two decades old.

>The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. 

That’s a huge difference.

That also means 40% earn less. Vs 33%.

Swinging 7% of the population from going down to going up means that the amount of income from that 7% is ripped from the hands of the Very top tiers- it can come from nowhere else- and redistributed to the working class.

That’s an enormous amount of overall income / GDP that is more evenly distributed to citizens.

I took community college classes while in high school. The cost for 1 year worth of classes was like $1000. I think it's up to $2000 right now but you get a fee waiver if you're poor. 

Most of the cost is if you're middle class or rich and want to go to a private school. 

If a German wants to go to Harvard, they pay the same price as an American (actually more) so that's not exactly the right comparison either. 

The right metric really should be cost of education (after scholarships, grants, government subsidies, etc.) vs future income. 

It's about 1.5% of future income. 

And again, the college educated in the US tend to make A LOT more than the college educated in a country like Germany. A LOT MORE. 1.5% is nothing in that comparison.",1647304431.0,1

Even if say, all said and done, your education cost you $50,000 extra in the US compare to in Germany. If the pay in the US is higher by $10,000/year, it will only take 5 years to break even. And in many professional jobs, US wages is significantly higher.

Tech being the biggest example: Median wages for a Software Engineer in Germany  : \~55,000 EUR (61,000 USD) to \~65,000 EUR (71,200 USD) / year ;

Median Software Engineer in the US - \~110,000 USD/ year;

Exposure to even moderate ambient lighting during nighttime sleep, compared to sleeping in a dimly lit room, harms your cardiovascular function during sleep and increases your insulin resistance the following morning, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.

“The results from this study demonstrate that just a single night of exposure to moderate room lighting during sleep can impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation, which are risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome,” said senior study author Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician. “It’s important for people to avoid or minimize the amount of light exposure during sleep.”

There is already evidence that light exposure during daytime increases heart rate via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which kicks your heart into high gear and heightens alertness to meet the challenges of the day. 

“Our results indicate that a similar effect is also present when exposure to light occurs during nighttime sleep,” Zee said.

Yes, that is the main way it is regulated.

Transient activation of p53 triggers blockage of the cell cycle, extended activation triggers apoptosis (regulated cell death). So by default it should definitely not be stable and active. You just ideally want it to become stable and active in cancer cells, to stop them dividing and hopefully make them die (though many of them are resistant to apoptosis in other ways).

There does appear to be one evolutionary optimization that we're lacking - elephants have many copies of their p53 gene, so it's much less likely for pre-cancerous cells to lose them.",1647299640.0,1

 ""Bob Hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station in Anaheim, providing they have a camera there and three people. He'll go to the opening of a market to receive an award. He'd get an award from Thom McCan for wearing their shoes. It's pathetic. It's a bottomless pit. A barrel that has no floor. He must be a man who has an ever-crumbling estimation of himself. He's constantly filling himself up. He's like a junkie – an applause junkie. What happens to those people when they can't get up and do their shtick, God only knows. Bob Hope, Christ, instead of growing old gracefully or doing something with his money, be helpful, all he does is he has an anniversary with the President looking on. It's sad. He gets on an airplane every two minutes always going someplace. It didn't bother him at all to work the Vietnam War. Oh, he took that in his stride. He did his World War II and Korean War act.

Worked for AOL for a brief time in the late '90s (it was terrible, the company had no ethics at all, but that's not the story here).

Accounts would get TOS violations, and sent to CAT (the Community Action Team) for a strike or block, which was either education, if it was a first or infrequent issue, up to account termination if it was egregious or frequent. 

However with celebrity accounts, even when they'd get a CAT strike or block, they wouldn't deal with CAT, but could still call the VIP team and get the block or strike removed, basically no questions asked.

So I absolutely don't doubt this story at all.",1647304473.0,448

He became legendary as Razor Ramon in WWF and continued to be successful in WCW as a founding member of the NWO.

But then after his life started to spiral out of control. He was known for showing up completely wasted an indie shows. Pretty much every wrestling fan considered him a lost cause.

But somehow, with the help of fellow legend Diamond Dallas Page, Hall was able to turn his life around and finally gave us insight into how great of a mind he had for wrestling. I always wished to see his return as a manager or trainer. So sad to see him go; wish he’d been around more but he could’ve left us much earlier.

He's really gonna be missed, was one of my favourite wrestlers of all time and when he jumped to rival WCW that was big news.

Edit, for those also unware of what Scott has gone through, there are these videos with Jake The Snake Roberts and Diamond Dallas Page.

Bad times don't last, but bad guys do."" 

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279012.0,36

Bad times don't last, but bad guys do."" 

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279019.0,10

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead. That knowledge, that I would take someone else's life, even in self defense, has permanently fucked up my mind. I thought I was a pacifist. I never knew how I would feel or what decisions I would make until I was in that situation. But now I know and I can't unknow it anymore.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die.

While I can't speak to your very specific and extremely traumatizing experience, I just wanted to share the perspective that pacifism and the right to defend yourself against the aggression of others are not at all at odds with each other.

I'm not religious myself, but **even Jesus** told people that nobody could be expected to just sit there and take any kind of treatment. He said, ""If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men."" To me, those provisos were his way saying, ""Be nice to people, but if someone comes around looking for a fight, that's on them, not on you.""

And as far as the ""turn the other cheek"" concept, I like this interpretation:

>At the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to be of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and dominance. If the persecuted person ""turned the other cheek,"" the discipliner was faced with a dilemma: The left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was demanding equality.

>Wink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10–13). By giving the lender the cloak as well, the debtor was reduced to nakedness. Wink notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, and not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20–23).

>Wink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions.[3] In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law, as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law.[4]",1647301393.0,3

I'm a bit of a rambler but I'll do my best to keep it concise, but there was a lot going on all at once. 

I had moved in with my then boyfriend of two years (now husband) and our roommate (best friend of husband, close friend of mine). We lived in a 340 sqft studio apartment (yes, that's a really small apartment for three people! It was supposed to be temporary while we looked for a 2 bedroom apartment) in one of those old apartments where they just stacked some studios on top of each other in concrete squares. We lived in the biggest city in the state and studios were the cheapest living, especially split three ways. It was the kind of place where when we heard scratches in the walls, we just assumed rats because well, its a shitty old apartment. 

On February 17th, we were woken up to a knocking sound coming from upstairs, like someone was aggressively putting together IKEA furniture. It woke my boyfriend and I up, and I just covered my head with my pillow. We had heard noises late at night from him so we just always assumed he worked night shift. Well this night, the banging noises didn't stop, and went on throughout the day until 1PM. 

At 8AM, my boyfriend got out of bed, and went to work. Our upstairs neighbor ran down the stairs, chased him into the parking lot and said ""If I ever catch you in my apartment again, I'll fucking kill you!""

Having never BEEN in this man's apartment, my boyfriend was confused, said ""Okay man"" and got in his car and started driving to work. He called me on the way and told me to make sure the deadbolt was locked. I did and told him to call the non emergency line (Note: At this time, we just thought this dude was victim of a break in and thought my boyfriend was part of it, we had no idea what was going on here). So he called them, they said they'd send someone over and to be home by 2 so we could give our statement. 

The roommate and I go about our day, listening to the banging, semi worried, mostly focused on applying for jobs (both of us recently unemployed). I'm more concerned than our roommate, but just waited for the cop to get here. 

Boyfriend comes back at noon, the banging stops at 1PM, at 2PM a cop comes over. She comes in, listens to our side of things (""We dont know this dude"",""weird noises last night"" ""threatened to kill me if i ever went into his apartment, I've never been in there"",etc), and goes up to talk to the neighbor. 

40 minutes go by. We can hear them through the floor, which really should have been a clue that the floor's structural integrity wasn't how it used to be. 

After 40 minutes, she comes back down and knocks on our door. We open the door for her, and she comes back in, turns around and deadbolts the door immediately. I'll never forget how she turned back to us and said ""Holy shit guys, its so much worse than we thought."" because that was the LAST thing I'd ever want a cop to say. I remember I burst out laughing. At the time life had been really rough on me and this just felt like a kick to the nuts. Of course it was worse than we thought. 

So I can't remember everything, there was a lot, but basically she went up there and this guy had FIVE locks on his door, that he himself had installed. He was VERY excited that a cop had ""finally"" come to help him. He claimed several things, but the ones that I can remember were that we had been floating (yes, floating) through the ceiling, whispering to him about how we would ""get"" him, how no one would ever believe him, how they'd never find his body, he claimed we had been sexually assaulting him every night, we've been spying on him and had put cameras in his apartment, he just couldn't find them because they were imperceivably small. How'd we get them in there? Well when we floated in there. Also that we had stolen his watch, his belt and had been drinking the milk from his fridge. 

So that knocking noise we had been hearing, from 3:30AM to about 1PM - well apparently he had decided he had had enough and ripped up all the carpet in the apartment and began digging a hole into his floor/our ceiling, to ""take care of the three punks downstairs"" and if the cops didn't do something about it, ""\[he\] would do what he needed to do, they needed to be stopped"" - based on his threat to my boyfriend, we took this to mean he planned on killing all of us. 

Oh, and what we thought were rats? Yeah turns out that he wanted to counter spy on us and had bought cameras and had been pushing them down the vents to try and spy on us. The  vents were in the bathrooms. I try not to think about it too much cuz the idea that this guy had footage of my 11PM shits and shower snot rockets (and you know, my naked body) is too creepy. The cop said the cameras he got weren't good quality nor were they hooked up to any sort of device that could save all the footage but still.

If you were able to snatch the gun from them, is it not equally likely that they can snatch the gun from you?

An attacker within arms reach is still a threat.

Now, if they turn and run, or throw their hands up and back off, cool. Confrontation over.

If they keep fighting with you, then... you may have to do what it takes to make them unable to harm you.

Problem of course is that there may not be time to wait and see if they throw their hands up.

I'm slightly shaking, partially out of terror but mostly from rage. Thankfully the cop is trained in mental health crisis, but this is a doozy even for her. She said the creepiet thing is the man APPEARED sound of mind. If it wasn't for the five locks on the door and  talking about us floating through the floor, he didn't come off like a lunatic. He had a job. He had no record (she checked) of mental health or criminal issues, though he did come from out of state, so we dont really know his background. 

  
So she tells us the game plan. In our state, if she admitted him involuntarily today, they would have to take his accusations seriously. He apparently wanted a rape kit done on him. If they did that, we would be continually exposed to this guy, and the cop could tell we were just knocked out of left field by this. It'd be months or YEARS of this following us around. So instead, she told us she would tell our apartment we needed to break lease and emergency vacate the apartment (the apartment had been notified at this point that this dude had ripped up the carpet and several light fixtures). Due to tennant laws in our state, they couldn't evict him immediately, but she could get us away from him immediately and she knew if we stayed he would eventually attack us. So what we had to do was vacate the apartment and get a restraining order. Because my boyfriend was technically the only one on the lease, he had to go get the restraining order. So he had to leave, and the cop had to leave to go with him and report to the judge.  She said she had called backup, but because this guy hadn't even technically gotten in, we had to wait for some cops to get done with other calls and get to us. The reason this needed to happen this way and with this timeline, was because if we got a restraining order first, and THEN he was admitted after we left the apartment, when they admitted him and he said ""my downstairs neighbors were r\*ping me"" the cop could say ""He doesn't have downstairs neighbors and the ones he did have have a restraining order against him"". It was the best way to protect us from dealing with it for years. But it meant leaving me and my roommate alone in the apartment. 

Before she left with my boyfriend to get the restraining order (This took a total of SIX HOURS because at this point it was 4PM on a Friday and the judge supposed to take care of our district had already left by the time they got to the courthouse. The whole time my boyfriends phone was dying so I had no clue when he'd get back) she asked if we had a gun on hand. We said yes - my boyfriends shotgun. She asked if I or the roommate knew how to use it, I said I did. In fact a month ago I had learned from a friend in the coast guard how to combat load it. She told me to keep it on hand but out of reach from the door. She had lied to the neighbor upstairs and claimed to be taking my boyfriend in for questioning, but had no clue if he would stay in his apartment like ordered. Not that that was safe either as he had already decided tunneling to us was a solution to his problems. 

I knew we were in a bad situation because the cop seemed so upset because she couldn't keep us safe. We were in a hard situation. Everyone involved in this was in a difficult situation, even mr crazypants upstairs. 

So that's how I sat, holding a shotgun in my lap for about six hours, next to my roommate, waiting for the crazy person upstairs to realize a door was much thinner and easier to get through than a floor-ceiling. And realized in that moment that if he came through the door, I was going to pull that trigger. That was honestly more traumatizing than realizing someone wanted to kill me - realizing that I was willing to kill them back. I think about that moment a lot, especially around the anniversary. It makes me feel cold in my soul. It takes something different inside someone to take a life, even in self defense, and you don't know its inside you until you're there. I haven't been able to watch the Life of Pi since, because I know what its like, having that Tiger on the boat (assuming you subscribe to that metaphorical interpretation). It's been five years and I still feel weird about that knowledge of myself now. 

To sum up the ending of a very, very long story, after six hours my boyfriend got the restraining order and the cops escorted us out of the apartment. We had just our backpacks, my medications, and the shotgun. We slept on several friends couches for two weeks while we tried to find a new apartment (and we did, eventually going back for our stuff). The first night I didn't sleep at all, just laid down next to my friends two puppies petting them, listening to my roommate and boyfriend snore. Last I had heard they were admitting mr crazy pants to a psychiatric hospital. That was five years ago and to be honest, I didn't really care to pursue it and just wanted as far away from it as possible.

I've now married said boyfriend and still am great friends with the roommate (who now has a girlfriend himself and god they're so cute together). Hilariously the \*NEXT\* upstairs neighbor (the one that ordered takeout every weekend and scared me haha) ended up being a therapist and helped me find a good one. I'm also god-mom to his dogs and he ended up playing Led Zeplin as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. So not all my neighbors have been bad lol

I just wanted to end by saying, I do not feel hatred towards the neighbor. I mostly feel pity. He thought we were torturing him, and if someone had been floating up and sexually assaulting me, I probably also would want to kill them. However I also do not feel guilt about holding a shotgun ready to shoot him, and I would not have felt guilty about shooting him if I had to. He was the one threatening to kill us after all and I'm sure if he had managed to kill my husband I probably WOULD hate him. I still cannot put into words how I exactly feel about it. My hope is he got help, somehow, and never put anyone else in danger. 

Hope you enjoyed the ride. I keep telling myself I'll put it on youtube but never get around to it lol",1647304309.0,8

* The portuguese royal family supposedly didn't have to flee the country, the french battalion that Napoleon sent to Portugal was weak and tired and couldn't have won the battles even if they wanted.
* The main reason Brazil is under developed to this day is because the country started being a nation (in a european sense) after 1808. After 1808, the country started having formal education, universities, books (were forbidden until then), currency, banks, justice system and a Constitution. Contrary to the US, in 1800, only 1% of the brazilian population was able to read.
* The brits were responsible for the voyage, and they noted many interesting things, like the very precarious situation in the portuguese ships, like the rotting wood of the ships, spoiled water, etc.
* In 1808, Rio didn't have currency (they exchanged goods) and the official language was Tupi Guarani (native tribe). Which means, Rio spent 300 years being developed in a semi european semi tribal way.",1647271724.0,11

> In 1808, Rio didn't have currency (they exchanged goods) and the official language was Tupi Guarani (native tribe). Which means, Rio spent 300 years being developed in a semi european semi tribal way.

Just no. First of all, there's no language called ""Tupi-Guarani"". Tupi-Guarani is the term of the branch, Tupi and Guarani being languages that share the same root. Second, we are talking about early 19th century Rio here. Sadly, most native people of the coast fled (or were murdered) centuries before that. 

You could say that São Paulo, in the 17th century, spoke mainly a Pidgin language between Tupi and Portuguese (with Spanish loan words), called Língua Geral Paulista, because São Paulo was an inland settlement, and it was the starting point of many incursions into the country seeking to enslave natives and search for goods (Entradas e Bandeiras). 

But Rio was a totally different thing.

Firstly, it's a costal city, at the time, the second largest city in Brazil, after Ouro Preto. Also, the main port where all the gold extracted in Minas Gerais was shipped to Europe (after the Estrada Real was closed in 1710 and Paraty lost importance). In fact, all that gold attracted lots and lots of Portuguese migrants (I'm a descendant of a few), and made Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro trully Portuguese-speaker places. Don't forget that years before, in 1789, there was a revolt in Ouro Preto against the Portuguese rule, lead by Tiradentes, himself son of a Portuguese settler. In 1763, the Marquis of Pombal transferred the colonial administration from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro.

Also, because it was already the capital for 45 years and all gold was shipped from there, there's no way they didn't had currency in 1808. Again, you could say that to 17th century São Paulo, but not 19th century Rio.

A métrica d'Os Lusíadas exige uma leitura silábica - o que, em linguística chama-se de pronúncia ""syllable-timed"", onde todas as sílabas possuem a mesma duração temporal. O português brasileiro possui essa característica. Já no caso do português europeu, a pronúncia é ""stress-timed"", e as sílabas tônicas possuem duração temporal muito maior que as outras sílabas. Daí a pronúncia cols-TROL europeia, enquanto a brasileira é CO-LES-TE-RÓU (como dizes).

Se declamares a primeira estrofe de Os Lusíadas, verás que o ritmo brasileiro encaixa-se melhor na métrica decassílaba camoniana, enquanto se acaso uses a métrica europeia, verás que o ritmo fica comprometido. E é compreensível, porque o português europeu adquiriu essa forma nos séculos XVIII e XIX, enquanto o brasileiro conservou uma forma mais arcaica de pronúncia, mais próxima da de Camões.
Português brasileiro:
AS-AR-MA-SEOS-BA-RÕE-SA-SSI-NA-LA-(dos)
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 sílabas

Português luso:
'SÁR-MaJ-EOS-BRÕE-SA-SNLA-(dux)
1-2-3-4-5-6 sílabas

Tendo dito isso, só engajei na discussão porque gosto de brincar com nossos irmãos do outro lado do Atlântico. Mas é dever do brasileiro defender o que é nosso: amo minha terra e meu modo de falar, com todas as variações e influências indígenas e africanas na língua que os portugueses cá deixaram. Palavras lindas, como ""cafuné"", ""dengo"", ""pipoca"", ""bagunça"", ""fofoca"". Aprecio muito a fonética lusa, escuto muito a vossa música. Torço para que MARO ganhe o Eurovision deste ano, com sua belíssima canção. Emociono-me com a interpretação incrível de Mariza de ""Ó Gente da Minha Terra"" aos pés da Torre de Belém. Ouço as Tunas de Coimbra e o Cante Alentejano.

Abraços brasileiros!",1647279053.0,6

The term Crown colony continued to be used until 1981, when the British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified the remaining British colonies as ""British Dependent Territories""

So maybe if she visited before 1981 we could count it?

Isso acontece em diálogo informal e não é em todos os dialectos - por exemplo os dialectos Nortenhos têm muito menos tendência a omitir vogais, e mesmo nos que ""abreviam"" mais, nunca é nem perto do extremo desse exemplo de 6 sílabas. Se alguma vez ouvires alguém a ler Camões dessa forma, deverá ter sido depois de uma boa garrafa de bagaço!

Poesia em especial requer uma leitura diferente, em que inclusivamente os poetas têm a liberdade de abreviar e juntar ou não palavras (através do uso do apóstrofo) conforme melhor serve o poema e a sua métrica e sonoridade.",1647287340.0,1
