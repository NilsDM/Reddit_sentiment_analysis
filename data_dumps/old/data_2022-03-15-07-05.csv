By analyzing the pant using a sonograph, this pant varies with bursts of frequencies. When this vocalization is played to dogs in a shelter setting, it can initiate play, promote pro-social behavior, and decrease stress levels. One study compared the behaviour of 120 dogs with and without exposure to a recorded ""dog-laugh"". Playback reduced stress-related behaviors, increased tail wagging, the display of a ""play-face"" when playing was initiated, and pro-social behavior such as approaching and lip licking.[[12]]

So they played the dog version of a laugh track to other dogs, and those dogs were more likely to do fun-related behaviors as a result. Sounds like it works like a human laugh to me.",1647345657.0,2

Additionally,

1. Chest pain/pressure - “an elephant is sitting on my chest”

2. A sudden change in mental status - “do you know where you are? Do you what today is? Do you know who the president is?”

3. Shortness of breath with chest pain (especially if you had recent surgery) - this could be a sign of a blood clot or if it moves to the lungs, a pulmonary embolism.

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

Many months later, and I still get anxious if I stutter, or go into a room and forget why I went into it.

EDIT: There are a lot of replies about the ER doctor being called an idiot, so let me clarify. Firstly, the Neurologist called him an idiot, not me. I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests.

Same thing happened to my dad, massive saddle PE. He drove to work a few days before Thanksgiving 2015, trying to make it to his desk from the parking garage winded him so bad he almost passed out. This embarrassed him, so he hid it with great difficulty. Sat down, started working, he was fine sitting motionless. Mistake number one. 

Happened again on a bathroom break. Almost collapsed trying to get there. Mistake number two. Decided to drive to Burger King and grab lunch, despite more of the same getting to the car and inside the restaurant. Mistake number three. 

A nearby coworker after lunch noticed how bad he must’ve looked or was struggling, said something. Dad brushed it off. Mistake number four. The coworker notified their manager. Apparently some guy had died at the office like a month earlier, heart attack, croaked in his chair. So the guy was trying to get him to agree to call 911. More embarrassment. Dad said fuck no. Mistake number five. 

Manager made him go home early, even walked him to his car. Saw him struggle, again offered 911. Dad said no, I’m gonna go home. Mistake number six. Called my mom at home and told her what was up, made it through his hellish 2hr freeway commute. 

This dummy got home and my mom met him at the door, concerned as hell, seeing him barely able to walk inside…. and tells her, nah, I think I’m gonna take a nap. I’ll feel better after a nap. (Low blood ox, probably did feel tired as fuck after breathing through a cocktail straw all day) 

My mom saved his life. She got PISSED and said the hell you are, we’re going to the emergency room or I’m calling an ambulance right fucking now and they’ll drag you out on a stretcher. 

This was finally too embarrassing for him, so he agreed and left with her. He was admitted within seconds and they brought a crash cart in the back of the ER while evaluating him. Straight to the ICU where he stayed for 3 days. 

My mom said every doctor and nurse treated him for the first 24hrs as if he had a bomb strapped to him. His pulmonologist said he should not have survived a clot of that severity, especially not after an almost full work day. He told him that if my mom had let him go lay down and fall asleep, he would never have woken up. 

He made a total recovery, with no significant damage to his heart (shockingly). He’s on Xarelto now for life. Unfortunately about six months before he could go on Medicaid, his insurance was cut off and he couldn’t have his blood thinners for months. They’re like $600 without insurance. We knew right away when he developed another DVT in his leg. Pain, heat, massive swelling. I begged him to go into the ER. I would rather us have to sell our home and live in the ditch than him die. 

The day his insurance came back, he didn’t want to go to the ER. Embarrassed again. I managed to force him to go to urgent care, where he was told to go to the ER (duh). Again, he said no, let’s just go home. It’s fine. I completely lost my shit on him and screamed at him in a waiting room full of people, the way the nurses looked at me I am certain they thought it was elder abuse. 

8.5 hours later we are home from the ER. Three clots in his leg and a shot of Lovenox in his stomach and a new script for Xarelto. 

I love my dad so much but goddamn. He’s like an animal that goes off and crawls behind a shed to die when he has serious health emergencies.

1094,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,3484,6630,0.95,"Rabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.  
  
Let me paint you a picture.  
  
You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the ""rage"" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.  
  
Except you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.  
  
Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)  
  
You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.  
  
The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.  
  
It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?  
  
At this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.  
  
(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).  
  
There's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.  
  
Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.  
  
So what does that look like?  
  
Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your ""pons"" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.  
  
Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.  
  
As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.  
  
You're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.  
  
You're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.  
  
You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.  
  
You're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you ""drink something"" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.  
  
Eventually, you slip into the ""dumb rabies"" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.  
  
Then you die. Always, you die.  
  
And there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.  
  
Then there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.",1647343394.0,42

Meaning that the testicle 'un-rotated' to fix itself.

Something similar happened to me;

2 AM, i have to go to clg in the morning and i got up to get a drink. I am unable to walk properly because im suddenly feeling alot of pain in my left testicle.

I go to sleep thinking the pain would go away. I wake up for college and the pain is too much so i have to take a leave.

The pain goes away by afternoon after a long nap, and i go about my day.

Next day, same thing happens. And the very next day too.

I tried to un twist my testicle myself (idk why tf i ever did that), it helped ease the pain. And i heard that the pressure from ejaculation can help correct the torsion so i did that, even though i was in so much pain. I don't know why i did that, that could have caused so many problems.

Not sure). Salt, dried or fresh dill, rosemary, and heavy cream. Can also use a half sweet walla walla onion but with the leeks can be too much…

Sauté bacon with cut leeks in some olive oil. Salt generously. When leeks are soft and bacon crispy, put in pot with broth and potatoes. Bring to boil, keep on boil for 10 minutes or until biggest chunks of potato are soft. Turn heat down before next step.

Using slotted spoon, pull out about 1/3 of the potatoes, put in blender with 1 cup heavy cream, blend until smooth. If heat is now simmer temp, add blended potatoes slowly back into broth (while stirring) with dill and rosemary. Simmer at medium to med-low while stirring for 15-20 minutes, longer with lower temp (but you MUST keep stirring or the cream will curdle and while it doesn’t change the taste much the texture is nasty)

The never ending chain of ""holy crap we're royally fucked"" moments. And finally the courtroom description of the accident interweaved with the reenactment is *such* a gripping episode.

I once rented a house that turned me into a total hippie/urban homesteader. This yard was a foragers dream. Random volunteer plants in the summer from previous tenant gardens, blackberries in September, a grape vine, walnuts and sweet chestnuts in October. So I learned how to harvest all of these things and make stuff from them. I wouldn't say what we made from the grapes was *wine* as much as backyard hooch but it was fantastic as a sangria base.

Walnuts were the messiest, I learned that the black stuff you wash off the shell from the husk was used historically to make ink (and is still used as a basis for furniture stain!), but my GOD they were amazing in our Thanksgiving stuffing.

So one day, I went out to get some blackberries for pancakes and I noticed two random leeks growing along the fence.

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off “just over a block” from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn’t recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn’t have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn’t find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it’d be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn’t call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn’t ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn’t believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn’t have money at the time, so I didn’t want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they’d release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I’d been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I’d been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn’t have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

But no matter how ill I had felt not long after he would get to my house I would start feeling good almost giddy. 

But our realationship seemed to be progressing nicely. We were redecorating the house ripping fireplaces out and getting rid of furniture and carpets.

Anyway it turns out that his intentions when he met me were very different to mine.

He had wooed me not because he saw us having a future together but because I owned my own house.

You see, before he met me he had gone from being a good little church boy to a druggy. This was ruining his marriage and his relationship with his kids. So he decided to find some wh\*re that owned her own house and get her to sign it over to him then overdose her. That way he could run his drug business from the house but without it being connected back to his kids and family home. We'd been decorating the house so that he could move into it. My mystery illness was him drugging me.

After I finished with him I was devastated. And going cold turkey. Meanwhile my family had decided I was a drug addict (voluntary) and turned on me.

If they misplaced something Id stolen it and mom would search my bags, screaming accusations at me. I never stole anything. I developed neuralgia, one symptom was loud noises would make me pass out from pain, my mother would scream in my face making me pass out repeatedly.

Except, this was a hired driver from the firm I used to work at that dropped us off at the strip club after I explicitly said I didn’t want to go. It was my 21st birthday and I was hammered - everyone else already went home. He kept shoving drinks down my throat and shoveling drinks my way. 

I was in a short dress and drunk. He just left me alone in the strip club and men were starting to notice and approach me. After I confronted him outside for leaving me - he just took off running, I mean SPRINTING. I followed him because hello, drunk and dumb 21 year old me didn’t know what to do so he shoved me and I wet myself because of how hard he pushed me. 

Dozens of people saw this go down and I was bleeding from both knees. Two girls came up to me and asked me if I was okay and offered a ride. I asked who they were and where and why they would help me - they both picked me up and threw me in the car and tried to fcking kidnap me. They thought I was so intoxicated I couldn’t defend myself. I demanded to be let out of the car multiple times and finally I realized I had my cell phone. I called 911 on speakerphone and told them I was being taken, they slammed the brakes and threw me out and sped off. 

At this point, it’s well past 3am and I’m soiled, alone and realizing what happened. His friend’s girlfriend came to pick me up and begged me not to go back. 

I did. For another five months before he beat me so bad I had welts all over my head and I was arrested for calling the police on HIM.",1647318967.0,114

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

Apparently her plan was to do what your ex did and trash my BIL to my MIL and make me an accessory in the process, thinking that I’d give her the number and side with her .. I did not give her the fucking number and chewed her a new Asshole for trying to start drama at 2am. To this day idk why she not only thought I’d help her but that my MIL would side with her.. They were both barely 18. Me and her were not close. My MIL was definitely not a fan. A month prior she had blown up my phone to the point it died while I was getting married!! She wanted me to leave my own wedding to pick her up and bring her!!! Even though the ceremony was family only and she knew that!! So she was already on my shit list and we were all fully aware she was nuts. At the time of the 2am phone call They’d only been together 2 months and She was extremely narcissistic and there was already a list of psycho shit she’d done and said to us. He wanted to leave her because she was controlling and isolating him from friends and family but she was not having that.  It took him 2 more months to leave her. She held his things ransom to the point we had to intervene and get his stuff ourselves. She made a huge scene. Scream/cried in the middle of the street. In a horribly manipulative attempt to gain sympathy she Told my prudish MIL that my BIL was using her for sex… it was bad. She called me from different numbers and would hang up for months after they broke up. I told my brother-in-law to use this as a teaching moment.

I remember that i cried that day. I dont remember why, my parents told me its because anday erlier my brother went to another city, and i dont want him to leave me.

There is this one girl, i dont remember her face or her name at all, i dont even know id she is still going to that church.
She comes, and she talked to me, she calm me down and pray together with me.

Im not that religious, although i still remember that moment.
Its not a big thing, she just calm down a kid, and in a way that she know and i know at the time, praying.
She isnt an adult either, i remember her being teen-like, maybe around 14-16 years old.

I dont think that person realize how much she effect my life.
We dont know when or whos life we can effect, and im sure most of the time we have no idea we did just that, over very small things. Like simply smiling to strangers, or go ask your old friend whats up.

If trying to live another day gave me just a small chance for me to do just that for someone else, im gonna try to hold into that, so maybe i can somehow lessen someone else's struggle, even when no one notice it, including me and them. Until this very day, this is one of the big reason why i stay.

When I was completely alone at the house I went for the gun and sat down, thinking about it. In my mind at the moment, I couldn't find any reason not to do it, so I pulled the trigger. 

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"". 

I knew she probably said it out of courtesy, but it was just enough for me to never do it again.",1647289453.0,22

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren’t appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don’t we spend more time with them, why don’t we go out more, why don’t we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don’t do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven’t done it yet, I probably won’t ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,71

My ex died last August from a drug overdose in the woods. Well honestly in an empty lot next to a construction site. It was egregious and terrible and brutal for him, and not the way any human being should be photographed by police or remembered by their parents. 

Was it a drug overdose as suicide? Was it a garden variety drug overdose? I think there's a 90% chance it was overdose as suicide, his mother doesn't feel that and I would never try to change her mind. 

Regardless of the method though, even if it had been some magical peaceful method (and you know it's a cruel joke that mother nature makes damn sure it's impossible to kill ourselves peacefully) it wasn't about the photographs or what his mother had to see. 

It was the fact her child was taken from her. Adult child but still her son. The people we are put here in the world to love beyond all reason and protect and guide into the future beyond us. It breaks a person. 

She thinks about him everyday. She hurts everyday. I check in on her occasionally and we touch base. There's not going to be a day that goes by in her life that she doesn't think of her dead son. And there have been a very few days between August and today that I haven't thought about him. 

Even though I have an extremely demanding life and a child and so many responsibilities I can't get everything done.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1134

Wich means, that as game developpement progress and as resolution increase, we could maybe see more and more scopes realistically rendered in fps.

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

Moreover I also have a technical question for the devs out there : if you decide to render a second scene for the scope, does it typically don't add any load on the gpu, since it also stops rendering a similar area on the ""main"" image ?",1647347952.0,4

Not necessarily the worst game, because Infinite Warfare clearly stands head and shoulders about the rest in that department, but ghosts was such a massive step back compared to BO2. Cod had an amazing run from cod4 to BO2 that came to a very abrupt end with ghosts.

* It had the worst maps of any cod game to date. Far too big. The one remedy for large maps is ground war yet that wasn't released on the old gen consoles which most people had at the time. 

* One of BO2's best features was the introduction of League Play, a massively popular gamemode. It took IW a couple of months to put in a worse version of it into their game. 
 
* The sniping as mentioned in this thread - awful. 

* Then the worst one, removing SnD?? I understand they added it in after a month or so but that was too late. You can't just remove one of your top 3 most popular and iconic gamemodes. 

* Impressive list of other stuff I totally forgot about by /u/ProTomahawks

You are rendering the same assets with the same texture after all.

Then please explain in your infinite wisdom why VR games don't perform the same as non VR games? After all, it's just rendering the same assets and textures twice but with a slight offset.

You really have no clue what you're talking about.. Just because it's rendering the same thing twice doesn't make it any cheaper... It's still rendering the same thing twice..

Older games typically had fairly basic lighting processes, that would light in-game objects on the spot, as they were being rendered. It was trivial to generate reflections back then, because you could afford to re-render each object along the reflection plane (the location and angle that objects are reflected at), due to how basic the lighting processes were.

Nowadays, we have far more complex lighting processes that take place well after in-game objects are rendered, across many passes. We have one pass done at half resolution to compute the ambient occlusion across the entire screen, another half resolution pass to compute an approximation of global illumination, a third full resolution pass to compute shadowing, then a fourth to combine everything and light every object on screen in one go.

Because of this, generating reflections isn't as easy as it was back then. You'd essentially need to repeat this same process again, except on the reflected geometry, potentially many times over for each reflection plane you desire. This would obviously cripple performance, so alternative methods had to be devised, and the most common is screen-space reflections.

Screen-space reflections reuse what's already been rendered to the screen, to avoid having to repeat all lighting processes. This makes generating reflections quite fast, but comes with the downside that only the things that have been rendered to the screen can be reflected, and the moment they go off screen, they stop being reflected.

Because of this, screen-space reflections need another method to fall back onto, and that's typically some form of cubemap or environment probes. Put simply, these are 360 degree renders of the game world at different locations, that have similar lighting processes to old games (to make generating them nice and quick). When screen-space reflections fail, they can instead fall back to either of these, and while they both aren't as accurate, they are convincing enough during gameplay.

Now with hardware-accelerated raytracing (ie RTX), there's a new alternative (or even fall back method) to screen-space reflections, that use a similar principle to older reflections, except they support an infinite number of reflection planes while maintaining a fixed performance cost.",1647348612.0,2

As Hino states, Blood Moons occur during full moons at midnight. This usually is random after a few in-game days pass in the game, although player's have theorized that it occurs more often when more enemies are slain.

It transpired that the occupiers were an elderly Indian couple, he was 98 and she was 97. The guy who owned the house next door rented it out to students who well behaved and gave no trouble, then a new lot moved in. I could hear the bass of their music reverberating through this couples wall, it was very upsetting for them. I went next door and had words with the new students, it turns out it was one grade A arsehole who was causing all the noise. I refocused his thinking on the noise he was making and all was serene. I call to go back to the couples address a week later, all was still good but I was greeted by the best Indian meal that I have ever eaten, all hand cooked by this lady. I have never had anything to touch it since",1647335974.0,6

I remember when Fiona Apple's ""Shameika"" won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance, and people were up in arms about it not really being Rock.  I really like the song.  I still have no idea whether it's really Rock or not.  But every 10 years or so, a totally new music emerges and becomes part of ""Rock and Roll"".  If your definition of Rock and Roll is Chuck Berry, you might be surprised by the Beatles ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", even though they were big fans of Chuck Berry.  If your definition of Rock and Roll is the Beatles, you might be surprised by funk emerging in the 70s.  (Actually I remember this discussion coming up separately on reddit once, of whether or not funk is rock.  To me it is, at least...)  If your definition is funk, you'll be surprised by New Wave.  If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

If I were to try to define Rock and Roll, maybe some of the key features are that it is loud and features guitars, but neither of these things are actually essential.

For those unaware, as Cash got popular, he was invited to play a private show for president Nixon and other high profile members of society. 

The Nixon admin thought it’d be a safe bet, because he played old boy, country music and wouldn’t have to worry about all the anti-war criticism being leveled at him at the time for Vietnam. Nixon hated the hippies and their anti-war sensibilities, so getting a show by good ol country boy Johnny Cash should have been a safe bet. 

So what does Cash do? Writes an anti-war song criticizing the elite called “what is truth” (banger song btw) and plays it at the show, right in front of Nixon, as the closer.

There's a reason why Shania Twain and Clay Aiken aren't still pumping out at least passable good music, but Madonna is. Madonna works with the best. Always. Fresh, new, new sounds, beautiful tracks. It's possible for Dolly, and even a Britney Spears, if they get a fresh new crew. Honestly, I'd only trust Madonna to manage teams for older stars, as odd as that is to say. She's has the best track record and longevity and an uncanny ear for the next new sound under her belt. She can hear or see something totally new and just know how it will work.

Dolly re-did Old Flames beautifully with Keshsa on her ""I'm a real artist"" album. Jack White blew his pud on Loretta Lynn. I would suggest someone who still has a fight in their belly. A great writer and lover of Dolly. The writer would have to know her, and still have a fight. As risky as this sounds, I'd hire Diane Warren to co-write, and Madonna to produce.

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that.

Legend of Dragoon is a fond one, Parasite Eve was scary for me. 

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

I earned my S class rating in Grand Turismo.

What’s crazy is how going to rent a movie or video game was a common occurrence for pretty much my whole life up until 10 years or so ago.

5738,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,629,15710,0.94,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

I'm appalled at the effects of Russian money in our elections and political campaigns. Sadly, we can't call the police to do anything about it now, we don't have that option.

Did Deripaska use the normal process for removing a squatter?

> The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

> After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

> * leave your property within 24 hours  
> * stay away from your property for 12 months

> To get final possession of the property, you must make a claim for possession.

No, they broke the door open and arrested them for trespass. So, actually, I'm more appalled that Russian Oligarchs who are sanctioned get more favourable treatment than British home-owners, who have to get a court IPO to have squatters removed.

The report also states that Manafort was sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, though investigators couldn't determine why. The report went on to mention that deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates thought Kilimnik was a Russian spy. The report outlines Kilimnik in contact with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, trying to resolve an issue involving Manafort owing a debt to Deripaska.**


*Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[1]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)*


>The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort **[redacted]** did not see a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

>...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, **[redacted].** Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 

>Gate's account about polling data is consistent **[redacted]** with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, **[redacted].**

>The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:

>> *I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.*

>> *Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]*

>Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.

**Furthermore, after being elected the Trump administration removed sanctions from Oleg Deripaska's companies.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)**

>The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.

>...The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from stray dog rescue to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.

>The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal’s biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.

>And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.

>In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them — in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.

>Notably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.

>...The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.

>Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.

>...Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.

>“Score that a win for Putin,” tweeted Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.

Btw, sorry to interrupt, there's a rumor circulating (in the fog of war i'm not sure rn) that zelenskyy wanted to cancel all taxes in ukraine in the war economy; still while it makes sense it's hard to check now have they checked whether their budget close ? :x Not sure it does; and they still need to pay their men (and pensions, emergencies, foreign deliveries etc) and basic services to keep society running on its footing. And prolly the billionaires and ultrawealthy should be put to contribution to some degree :/ in french they say that money is the nerve of war (or can the EU prop up a bit their funding?)

edit i'd probably add a provision in the martial law too that fighters/soldiers can't be foreclosed/evicted (loose their home) due to unpaid/unpayble bills too right now :x

Virtually anyone who uses a computer can access western news, if by ""actual"" you imply pluralism.

We know enough. Even more than what gets reported in ""western"" news. But what of it? There is a wierd sentiment that I see in the western part of the internet which is that people expect Russians to do some kind of miracle, that even Americans were not capable of regarding the US invasion of Iraq in their supposedly free and democratic society.

Like, how is this even supposed to work, that you show Russians videos of ""army shelling cities"" (some of which are actually recycled older videos from Donetsk, that were already presented to Russian audience as ""evidence of Ukrainian agression in Donbas"" few years ago), and they will wave their magic wand, and all the war, strife, hunger and famine suddenly disappear?

They think they'll rule the ashes if they destroy the american gov and its democracy (they tried on jan6, 'member ?)

i would VERY STRONGLY suggest to disregard any ""tax cut policy"" no matter the form the US would try to force on ukraine, exploiting its wartime vulnerability.

If the [republicans (trumpists; remember trump who was attempting to blackmail Zelenskyy ? bad people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal).) are trying to carry out the same shit in ukraine they carried out in russia, they need to be told to fuck off in no uncertain terms

The results can be seen in russia where corruption rotted their army. The last thing ukraine needs to is to imitate that while fighting for their survival.

And this isn't a joke, the red states the ""tax cuter"" trumpists run, notably mississippi, louisiana, or kansas, are actually poorer than wartime ukraine. This is no joke, it runs countries into the ground and the oligarchs don't give a flying fuck about that as they flee the country with the tax money. 

And i'm concerned they are trying to exploit their position and the situation to also run ukraine into the ground, on basis of their extremist far right ideology.

The people who think this is even remotely a good idea should try visiting an US red state with no healthcare, no education, no police/fire service, no pensions, no phone service/electricity/potable water/garbage collection/... in half the state (in a peace time.) and where all the infrastructure (bridge, roads, rail, ...) is falling apart even worse than siberia's. Oh and also you don't own your home, an oligarch do and tell you you owe him $2000 a month in ""housing rent"" (which most people don't have) or his goons make you homeless at gun point (explosion of homelessness in america). Very much not a wanted future. They're basically 90's russia.

In normal, less turbulent times,  people find it easier to compartmentalize and 'play the game'/prioritize their own self interests over an ethical/moral way of living since it's easier to diminish negative consequences of your actions/thought process, in your own mind. Sadly that's when the need for bravery and consistency rises even more.

Right now atleast you know the whole world is watching and maybe your sacrifice will have an use or be inspiring. In normal times you don't even have that guarantee.

This is not really true. That's what it *should* be about.

Also, maybe you're not old enough to remember this band called the Dixie Chicks, but when they spoke out against the war in Afghanistan, country music stations stopped playing their songs, they were essentially blacklisted, or as we call it today, ""cancelled"".

Of course that is not government censorship and in the US we're lucky to be able to criticize our leaders. But their statement against the war tanked their career and they were labeled as anti-American.",1647352085.0,1

You're living in a very innocent world and I both envy you, and am disgusted by you at the same time.

All because you live in some kind of fairy tale, where the total dictator of Russia, what? Couldn't get away with executing Maria? Or is it that you think he wouldn't actually be evil enough on paper to dispose of someone who publicly undermined him in such a huge way? 

Even if he gave a crap about killing someone like that, which I assure you, he most certainly does not. He can't just let people get away with that and go Scott free. Lest everyone get the idea they can behave that way and remain unscathed by consequence. You don't get to singlehandedly rule an entire country, their wants and needs be damned, what you say goes, buy what you wanna buy with the country's wealth, just do whatever the eff you want basically, at the populations expense while many of them suffer greatly... Especially in this day when a lot of them will know damn well that most other countries are not this way in the slightest, that most of the civilized world enjoys freedoms they can only dream of.

You can't keep that kind of thing under control if you aren't one of the coldest, most ruthless, murderous psychopaths walking the planet currently. It just wouldn't hold up for long... There needs to be fear, or people will rebel, and you're screwed...

Given Russia's history of silencing dissidents and the current environment, rights now its very much a grey territory with grave concerns valid. Continuous highlighting of the issue and the serious threats she can potentially face,  might be one of the only ways to ensure her safety.

Also your casual claim like, ""More likely she'll get a fine and maybe a prison sentence"" in return kinda make light of the level of authoritarian grip the country is descending into as the war goes on.

My point is that people claim to be afraid of protesting because they'll get killed when that's not what they're doing right now.

 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

I was a college kid. Not even a political science major. Was just simply interested in the way government really worked. WAsn't doing it for the reference letter or any big future connection (since I had no ambition to work in politics at all). 

I just wanted to see American government for myself. 

And holy SHIT.

What a bunch of shitbags.

I worked 100 feet from Newt Gingrich. (This was in the 90s; I was in Rayburn.) I went to the Congressional dining room all the time. Gave tours of the Capitol. Did all that shit. And every second of it was like bathing in oil and spit. 

One fun thing I got to do:

I'd never worked an office phone before. Or a fax. And I kept fuckign them up. 

One day Jack Kemp called for my boss. 

""Yes, sir, Mr. Kemp,"" I said. ""I'll put you right through.""

And then I pushed---or thought I pushed---the connect-call button. But somehow I fucked it up.

And hung up on him.

I hung up on Jack Kemp.

He called back.

""So sorry, sir,"" I said. ""We've been having trouble with these phones all week. I'll put you right through.""

Then I did it again.

He called back again.

I gave him some line again.

Tried again. 

Hung up on him again.

THRICE I hung up on Jack Kemp. 

Finally, almost in tears, I had to beg another intern---one who hated me---to do it for me.

He’s directed Russian airlines to seize foreign planes they lease. That basically guarantees that no leasing company will ever do business with Aeroflot or the likes again; they’ve bombed hospitals, sent assassination teams to find Zelenskyy, and are openly recruiting fighters from Syria (which Russia used as a proxy to harass US and coalition forces) to fight in Ukraine. They shelled a nuclear power plant, and Russia has assassinated dissenters (Litvinenko, the attempted killings of the Skripals, and many others) for years. 

Putin and his cadre have no scruples, they hold and wield the power they have with an iron grip - because they know that is the only way that they stay in power. 

I’m going to retract my statement earlier and say she’s not definitively dead, but I would still be very surprised if she was alive - and if she is, it’s only because of political expedience, not humanitarian values.

From the highest-paid actor in Hollywood to straight-to-video B-movies: The rise and fall of Bruce Willis.

In the last eight years, the actor has made 29 films, 23 of which never made it to the cinema. The parody award show the Razzies has also given the actor his own category for ‘worst performance’

Crossing paths with the producer was the worst thing that has happened to Willis’s career, but the best thing that has happened to his bank account. According to industry website Vulture, Emmett has developed a system for mass-producing movies in which he gathers together a team of people looking to embellish their CV, convinces a veteran star (John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Al Pacino, Robert de Niro, Steven Seagal, etc) to put in a couple of days’ work for $1 million and then uses their face on the promotional posters to land international distribution deals. The star tends to appear in just three scenes, at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the movie. In Hard Kill, Willis is on screen for a total of seven minutes; in Extraction, eight, and in Survive the Night, just under 10.",1647350612.0,4

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

When the rose slowly bloomed in the studio splash screen, I let out a hefty chuckle because it seemed so retro and campy at the same time. I heard sneers from 2 rows behind us. My girlfriend was embarrassed after about 20 minutes when I was laughing so hard I couldn’t catch my breath. The movie audience of about 35 was completely silent but I couldn’t help myself. We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn’t be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie. Sometimes I think my laughter just became so infectious because it was so cathartic and uproariously uncontainable. The movie would not be denied, I hadn’t laughed that hard for eons and when “you’re not supposed to”, that made it even funnier and more taboo - and even funnier. Damn it, that little film was so clever and raw and manic and goofy and terrifying it will always hold a special place in my heart.

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

He was however, allowed to make a sequel. He elected to go ahead and film Evil Dead II as a remake and then tack 10 minutes of exposition on at the beginning to technically make it a sequel - so your method is pretty spot on for how it was intended to be watched.

Those ten minutes are the part he compromised to get it greenlit, everything else was all him. 

People tend to talk down Evil Dead but I think both are excellent, just different vibes.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90’s.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

There’s horror all over the series. The books are very scary. Mordor and Sauron’s primary power is literal terror. 

What other kind of director can showcase an “inanimate object” negatively affecting everyone and everything around it? To give you a sense of fear and dread up front of what it would mean to the world if this power was unleashed. 

There are so many epic heroic moments. They all stand on the foundation of confronting and facing the terror. To be a literal little person in a big world and stand up to the evil.

""Oh no, I'm not talking about your grandfather, I'm talking about the monsters in the movie. They're called Deadites, and they're demons that are summoned by an evil magical book called the Necronomicon.""

""If the Deadites aren't dead human beings, who are the evil dead the title is referring to?"" 

""The humans that the Deadites kill become possessed by the Deadites.""

""Fair enough. So what else happens in this movie?"". 

""There's an evil tree that rapes people.""

""...what?"" 

""I said that there's an evil tree that rapes people."" 

""...what?"" 

""I said that there's an evil tree that rapes people. Are you going hard of hearing, producer guy?""

""No, I just can't understand the concept. Trees aren't scary and aren't sapient. They can't rape human beings because they aren't technically alive.""

""Well, this tree is also possessed by the Deadites, but trees are naturally scary to begin with.""

""If you say so. So how are the demons going to appear? Are they going to be red and have horns? Make up and costuming is expensive."" 

""Super easy, barely an inconvenience. I'm just going to have the camera take place from the point of view of the Deadites as they chase the protagonists around the cabin so we never have to show them."" 

""Ooh, creativity on a limited budget is tight!""",1647315906.0,-1

Last year my brother and I watched the same movie in the same theater.  Everyone was super tense and quiet.  A girl and her date noped out at the beginning of the second act right about the time the sister starts calling out the cards.

This time, the crowd was way more into the comedic timing of it and was laughing at how serious the characters were treating the over the top absurdity of it.

It’s beautifully animated, but the story is weak and kind of nonsensical. The music is alright, most of the songs are pretty catchy (“We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is overrated AF, and the best song is the one She-Hulk sings), but mostly sound like generic pop music with a radio-friendly structure and sound rather than a theatrical/movie musical structure and sound. The lyrics can get clumsily busy, and I really wanted to hear a soundtrack/score that sounds more Latin American than what was ultimately offered. There’s only a few hints of Latin Jazz, Cumbia, and Habanera here and there. The music just comes across as generic and easily replaced, most of it doesn’t feel like it’s part of the movie. 

   There’s also so many characters in this movie with the writers trying to fully flesh out each one, but it falls flat in a movie made for the attention span of children.  Seriously, there are so many characters it’s impossible to remember all their names unless you’ve seen the movie multiple times. The only name I can remember is Bruno, and only because his name is in a song title. Had to come up with nicknames for them that either describe their powers or their relationships to other characters, like Animal Boy, Brown Poison Ivy, Batgirl, ADHD Nightcrawler, the aforementioned She-Hulk, Narcissistic Grandma, Main Girl, Animal Boy’s Dad, etc. The only character you can remember the name of is the one we’re not allowed to say. 

I know Encanto is a strictly Disney Film and not a Disney Pixar film like Coco, but Coco is far superior  (faaaaaaarrrrrrrrr superior) when it comes to a movie about Latin America, the people who live there, and the importance of family. The plot isn’t muddled and anti-climactic, the music actually feels like it belongs in the movie, and there’s still a large cast of characters, but they’re handled appropriately: you can remember the names of all the characters important to driving the plot, and the rest of the cast is mostly there for support, comic levity, and variety of voices delivering incidental lines.

Also Coco made me cry and want to see it again, and I finished Encanto feeling neutral and uninterested.",1647334879.0,2

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,27

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

>Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property. ""I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew—at least they claimed to be Communists—couldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.""

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor. 

That's not even getting to the fact that the wealthy have power to control access to reaources and opportunities so that only their existing family/friend/class networks can benefit and so secure their social and economic position.",1647307744.0,167

Yet, despite this, there appears to be overall very little upward mobility happening and we're currently living through a period of time with economic inequality in the United States bordering on, if not surpassing, the incredible inequality that preceded the French Revolution.

So... what are we supposed to make of this? We can't be lazy and pull a hand wavy ""well nobody wants to work hard!"" because that's nonsense. The only reasonable answer is that upward mobility is not as accessible as we've been led to believe it is. If upward mobility was simply just a day's hard work away, every maid and lineman in America would be moving to Beverly Hills.

And on a personal note, your last sentence really struck me. A million bucks isn't what it used to be and if you can't trade a whole lifetime of labor and investing for a few million bucks these days then maybe you need to revisit what you think upwardly mobile really looks like.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,76

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

>It also didn't take root because Americans are richer than Europeans (though the Europeans are catching up). Most people don't appreciate the gap between the US and most other countries. There is no large country (population bigger than a major US metro area) that compares to the US and even the poorest US state is richer than Germany and the UK. 

>The middle class (defined by median disposable income, adjusted for household size and PPP net of taxes, healthcare costs, etc.) in the US are better off than those in every country not named Norway or Lichtenstein. There aren't very many Norwegians. And Norweigan Americans make more than Norweigans.

Well be glad socialism never took in the US. But I feel most Americans conflate ""social policies"" to ""socialism"".

So you end up with Americans - both from the right and the left of the political spectrum - thinking that socialism is ""free"" healthcare and education. Which creates a whole lot of problems for any policies pushing for those important causes to ever happen. And access to education and health are crucial for any country, less excusable for a modern ""rich"" country.

The left will talk about wanting socialism and at times will praise self-proclaimed socialist/communist countries (dictatorships) and promote their propaganda (Cuba, Venezuela, etc) and the right will talk about how they don't want to end up with socialism ""like Cuba or Venezuela, etc"".

The Nordic Model is not equal to socialism and hasn't made those countries socialist in Europe. Over time, any socialist model in the real world (outside ""1st world"" classrooms), including Europe, have end up in failure as well. Socialism does end up blending the lines between different socio-economic status levels, destroying middle class and making people similarly poor for the most part.",1647313606.0,3

I've got a friend, initials DID, who grew up in a trailer park to first gen Trinidadian immigrant parents who speak with heavy accents, so zero privilege. In 5th grade, DID's teacher thinks he's pretty smart and he should do an international baccalaureate (IB) preparedness program at a magnet middle school (harder middle school classes to prepare for harder high school classes). DID convinced his parents to sign the forms, which they only do because the school is a magnet program so he'll be added to a bus route and they won't have to take him to the miles further away middle school.  
  
During 8th grade, DID does all the paperwork himself to get into magnet high school with the IB program. DID excels in the IB program and gets into the nearby state university (now a top 10 public university) on a variety of scholarships and grants, which he researched and applied for all by himself. Never received any financial help from any family members.  
  
At the University, DID meets eventual wife, who is premed. Travels around the country with her for med school and residency. Works at several advertising firms along the way. After residency, moves to Jacksonville, FL where wife takes job at one of the hospitals and DID founds his own online advertising firm. Now DID makes like $300k/year and his Dr wife makes more and they live in a huge house like 6 blocks from the beach.  
  
That covers the work ethic and up by his bootstraps point. Now the natural intelligence.  
  
DID has 4 siblings. They're all short sighted, immediate gratitude, poor decision making, in their 40s and still working menial jobs BUT as far as I know (known DID since 6th grade) not on drugs or with criminal records (so it isn't like they got into the system early and had additional barriers). The only one who doesn't live in a trailer park near the parents, check to check, is one sister who married her HS boyfriend who eventually became a Ford dealership manager after working there like 20 years and lives a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  
  
Those 5 people grew up in the same home, all born in the USA, none had noticeable accents, and all went to the same schools outside of DID choosing basically on his own to go to the two magnet programs. All of his siblings suffer from dumb people issues like lack of logic and inability to prepare for the future. The only explanation is DID being naturally smarter than his siblings.",1647305935.0,-1

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

>Values have been adjusted for **purchasing power parity** and take into account both the payment of **taxes and social contributions**, and transfers in kind received by households (such **health** or **education** provided for free or at reduced prices by government).

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems? What if it was it up ***them***?",1647314371.0,3

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,7

The process is called 'priming.' People are more likely to pick something they feel they are familiar with even if they don't remember how or why they became familiar with it in the first place. It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high.

The other study was modern data and you dismissed that.

The other study sucked, for obvious reasons which I explained at length. It's not my fault that the first study was so poorly done, nor that the second study is over two decades old. That's historical data at this point, not a current representation of either the US or Germany's status in 2022.

This last article you linked to (Stockhausen) is the only decent one among the three. It seems to analyze relevant data, although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. It's not nothing, but it's also not very much in absolute terms.

Oddly, the abstract claims that, ""while the majority of German males has been able to share in the country’s rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground."" However, this is directly contradicted by the results themselves, which clearly indicate that well over half of American men earn more than their fathers. The majority of both American and German men are doing better than their fathers.

 Notably, this study does not evaluate the amount of improvement per individual (i.e. only the number of people who earn more, not how much more they earn), nor does it address the downward mobility included in the original study which started this thread.

Altogether, I would have to say that the results do not make a compelling case for any sort of policy guidance.",1647313173.0,10

It didn’t. Your reasons were bad.

Income mobility is, by definition, a measure of parent to child. It must, therefore, span many decades. Generally at least 5 decades, often 6- enough time for the parents earnings to be captured over time, to start. Then for the child to become an adult, and then that adult child to now have a long period of adult earnings to be averaged over time and compared to the averaged over time earnings of the parent.

And it must have good data about both parent, and child, and they must be comparable.

Can you think of Any reason, any at all, why they would predominant use the data of fathers… from 50-60 years ago?

And not mothers? In the 60’s and 70’s? Any reason at all that data about women’s the earnings, in the 60’s and 70’s, might not be great for analysis of societal income mobility?


>nor that the second study is over two decades old. 

Again, these studies must, by definition, span close to half a century. There is no evidence that these types of massive country level trends change quickly.

>although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really).

Really?

Give this a good think.

>The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. 

That’s a huge difference.

That also means 40% earn less. Vs 33%.

Swinging 7% of the population from going down to going up means that the amount of income from that 7% is ripped from the hands of the Very top tiers- it can come from nowhere else- and redistributed to the working class.

That’s an enormous amount of overall income / GDP that is more evenly distributed to citizens.

If you think it’s so little, then let’s have the US copy Germany’s much higher taxes and social welfare policies, to drive exactly that outcome.

I took community college classes while in high school. The cost for 1 year worth of classes was like $1000. I think it's up to $2000 right now but you get a fee waiver if you're poor. 

Most of the cost is if you're middle class or rich and want to go to a private school. 

If a German wants to go to Harvard, they pay the same price as an American (actually more) so that's not exactly the right comparison either. 

The right metric really should be cost of education (after scholarships, grants, government subsidies, etc.) vs future income. 

It's about 1.5% of future income. 

And again, the college educated in the US tend to make A LOT more than the college educated in a country like Germany. A LOT MORE. 1.5% is nothing in that comparison.",1647304431.0,6

But put that aside for a second, here are some samples of tuition of public university's in state tuition.

State University of New York - $7070/year  [https://www.suny.edu/smarttrack/tuition-and-fees/](https://www.suny.edu/smarttrack/tuition-and-fees/)

University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA) : $13804 / year [https://admission.ucla.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees](https://admission.ucla.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees)

University of Texas at Austin :  [https://onestop.utexas.edu/managing-costs/cost-tuition-rates/.   ](https://onestop.utexas.edu/managing-costs/cost-tuition-rates/)  $13576/year ($6788/semester)

Even if say, all said and done, your education cost you $50,000 extra in the US compare to in Germany. If the pay in the US is higher by $10,000/year, it will only take 5 years to break even. And in many professional jobs, US wages is significantly higher.

Tech being the biggest example: Median wages for a Software Engineer in Germany  : \~55,000 EUR (61,000 USD) to \~65,000 EUR (71,200 USD) / year ;

Median Software Engineer in the US - \~110,000 USD/ year;

A Nurse in Germany \~33,000 EUR / year (36,100 USD) ; A Nurse in US \~ $75,000 / year

I'm a professor of physics of applied medicine so I know how to use google scholar ;) (even if I work mostly in nuclear medicine so radiotherapy is not my main topic).

I did mention ""most of the pathologies"", as I know that protons are the only options for ocular tumors and for some other rare radio-resistant ones. 

But for 95% of the current radiotherapy machine use cases (e.g.: breasts, prostate) I can't see a case where even if protons were cheaper than photons I'd use them, given the current limitations. That's why I was asking if a proper comparison has ever been performed (Japan?).

That's an ill-posed question as the mechanism of ionisation is quite different, and that it depends on many factors (particle energy mainly).

A few centers with extremely limited land have managed it, but most centers are new buildings on the same campus, or standalone centers separated from existing medical facilities.

There are more compact solutions available like half-gantries, where it is limited to 180 degrees of rotation or a bit more, and you treat from the other side by spinning the table around 180 degrees.

The size of the accelerator needed is related to the depth of the targets that will be treated. If you only plan to treat shallow targets like ocular melanomas, you don’t need the same beastly accelerator that you’d need for treating deep targets in large patients.

The National Association for Proton Therapy has [36 Member Centers](https://www.proton-therapy.org/map/) in the USA with 3 more under construction, plus two more non-member centers in the USA. There are many more centers around the world. That doesn’t take away from your point that yes, they are expensive, bulky, and won’t be widespread any time soon.

As a general response to the article headline, and to a bunch of other comments, I wish writers would stop saying that protons are a superior form of treatment to X-rays without adding “for some treatment sites and disease types”. Protons are amazing for some types of treatments, but X-Rays and Gamma Rays are better for others. Brachytherapy is better for others. Some treatments types are equivalent for a given treatment site or disease type.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

To add to this, counter AA technology NEEDS you to be targeted to counter them

In electronic warfare. The pilot needs the AA battery to turn their RF systems on (like radar and RF guidance for missiles) to geolocate their position, submit it to the rest of the forces, then counter attack *likely before the AA battery even fires*

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire.

My favorite use of your version of this tactic is in operation desert storm, by BG Larry Henry (call sign Poobah).

He flew un-manned drones towards these sites, and the Iraqis, thinking they were American f-15s and 16s, turned on their radars and fired.

They even triumphantly reported kills!

US and NATO pilots tend to have an average of 200 flight hours per year, while Russian pilots only get somewhere between 60-100. The US and NATO pilots use that extra flight time to train on stuff like SEAD.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova.

As for why they haven’t equipped drones with HARMs, I’m not actually sure — Israel, India, and Turkey use the IAI Harop/Harpy 2 which is a loitering SEAD platform, so it stands to reason it’s well within US capabilities. I suspect it’s because they like to fly SEAD missions “heavy” i.e. with a lot of pylons for multiple roles, but would need someone more qualified than an amateur to comment on the topic.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.  I was reading a few days back a thread of people who'd tracked cruise-missile launches by planespotting the rockets from cellphone cameras and CCTV back to the launch corridor within minutes.

[Conversations with Brando](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/309025.Conversations_With_Brando) is a fun read if you're a fan, or just morbidly curious. I found it to be a pretty interesting look into his persona. Just a snippet:

 ""Bob Hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station in Anaheim, providing they have a camera there and three people. He'll go to the opening of a market to receive an award. He'd get an award from Thom McCan for wearing their shoes. It's pathetic. It's a bottomless pit. A barrel that has no floor. He must be a man who has an ever-crumbling estimation of himself. He's constantly filling himself up. He's like a junkie – an applause junkie. What happens to those people when they can't get up and do their shtick, God only knows. Bob Hope, Christ, instead of growing old gracefully or doing something with his money, be helpful, all he does is he has an anniversary with the President looking on. It's sad. He gets on an airplane every two minutes always going someplace. It didn't bother him at all to work the Vietnam War. Oh, he took that in his stride. He did his World War II and Korean War act. ""Our boys"" and all that. He’s a pathetic guy.“",1647306298.0,7

Worked for AOL for a brief time in the late '90s (it was terrible, the company had no ethics at all, but that's not the story here).

Accounts would get TOS violations, and sent to CAT (the Community Action Team) for a strike or block, which was either education, if it was a first or infrequent issue, up to account termination if it was egregious or frequent. 

However with celebrity accounts, even when they'd get a CAT strike or block, they wouldn't deal with CAT, but could still call the VIP team and get the block or strike removed, basically no questions asked.

The entire premise of what you are trying to say is completely incorrect. The rise of Boomer's also coincides with the rise of the counterculture and the backlash against conservative figures. Boomers are the reason why art from the mid 60s to early 70s is still held in such high regard, because things that were more risky and broke social conventions were particularly marketable and popular amongst young people. 

Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, John Wayne and so on are all figures that are really held up by the generation before. I know you said (when boomers were growing up) but Boomer culture hadn't come into it's own at this point and these figures weren't being marketed towards boomers, so they weren't for boomers.

I might point you towards the biggest figures amongst Boomers who were absolutely not fascist pricks and are still some of the most respected figures in all of art/society. Bob Dylan, McCartney, Lennon, Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Jim Morrison are really their most famous musicians and very much not fascists. Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood (yeah I know but he's a moderate Republican), Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep and so on are amongst the most popular actors amongst Boomers, and very much not fascist. The big sporting figures, Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Willie Mays, Bill Russell, very much not fascists. 

I'm Gen Z, but the point you are trying to say is literally the opposite of reality. These actors weren't most popular with boomers, and there is a line in history (somewhere between 63-65) where Western media diverges from the more traditional conservative sort of things and pushes in the opposite direction to attract boomers, and it's very obvious looking at the changes in fashion, music, the way people talked, spiritual and political beliefs and that sort of thing. It's fucken stupid how boomers get characterised as a conservative generation when their youth was far more extreme than the youth of today. Mainstream music, film and magazines are a lot more mainstream and less experimental, fashion is a lot plainer and more conservative in some ways and celebrities now are a lot, lot more commercial and conservative than the ones that the boomers idolised.",1647331624.0,4

Stretch Rolls Royce. A small woman who was the driver got out and opened the door. Michael got out. Wide-brimmed hat. Orange corduroy button down shirt over a white tee, grey sweatpants. White socks and little black shoes. I said “hi!“ and he said in the tiniest voice ever: “uh, I’m here for the production”. I escorted him inside. He was like a little alien person. I just felt like he could break like an egg. Pedro, who was the other production assistant was supposed to have some special lunch for Michael and he fucked it up. We had laughs about that. But yeah, being the only witness to Michael Jackson getting out of a car on a really crappy street in Hollywood was kinda noteworthy.

Mostly I remember that me and Pedro and Leonardo and Sean Penn stood in a doorway and chain smoked a lot.

Also, Jon Lovitz is maybe the nicest celebrity I ever met.

Tony Kaye had a bunch of his actor kids in there including Tony Ward. Brando insulted Ward, they had words, Ward and all Kaye’s people walked. It was hilarious because it’s always fun when work burns down to the ground.

So, essentially as it moves away from the center of gravity (in this instance, think of it as the center of the star although it's a little bit off), it arcs quite slowly, but as it approaches the star it whips around.

Think of this orbit as kind of like a baseball field.  When you're going around the outfield, you're not turning that much in any one step, but as you come around home plate each step has a huge amount of arc in it.

If you draw a line through the middle of home plate, each side has 180 degrees. When you're near home plate, you can walk from one side around to the other in 2 or 3 steps. You've covered those 180 degrees in 2 or 3 seconds. 

Walking the same speed, it will take you what, 10 minutes? 20 minutes? to walk around down to third base, around the outfield, back down to first base, and back to home plate, completing the other 180 degrees and get back to where you started.

The end result of this is that for each degree of bend, when the object is in the outfield, it has many more steps to get across that degree, and so gravity out there, despite being weaker, has more time to act upon it.

He became legendary as Razor Ramon in WWF and continued to be successful in WCW as a founding member of the NWO.

But then after his life started to spiral out of control. He was known for showing up completely wasted an indie shows. Pretty much every wrestling fan considered him a lost cause.

But somehow, with the help of fellow legend Diamond Dallas Page, Hall was able to turn his life around and finally gave us insight into how great of a mind he had for wrestling. I always wished to see his return as a manager or trainer. So sad to see him go; wish he’d been around more but he could’ve left us much earlier.

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279012.0,43

Bad times don't last, but bad guys do."" 

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279019.0,10

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead. That knowledge, that I would take someone else's life, even in self defense, has permanently fucked up my mind. I thought I was a pacifist.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die.

I'm a bit of a rambler but I'll do my best to keep it concise, but there was a lot going on all at once. 

I had moved in with my then boyfriend of two years (now husband) and our roommate (best friend of husband, close friend of mine). We lived in a 340 sqft studio apartment (yes, that's a really small apartment for three people! It was supposed to be temporary while we looked for a 2 bedroom apartment) in one of those old apartments where they just stacked some studios on top of each other in concrete squares. We lived in the biggest city in the state and studios were the cheapest living, especially split three ways. It was the kind of place where when we heard scratches in the walls, we just assumed rats because well, its a shitty old apartment. 

On February 17th, we were woken up to a knocking sound coming from upstairs, like someone was aggressively putting together IKEA furniture. It woke my boyfriend and I up, and I just covered my head with my pillow. We had heard noises late at night from him so we just always assumed he worked night shift. Well this night, the banging noises didn't stop, and went on throughout the day until 1PM. 

At 8AM, my boyfriend got out of bed, and went to work. Our upstairs neighbor ran down the stairs, chased him into the parking lot and said ""If I ever catch you in my apartment again, I'll fucking kill you!""

Having never BEEN in this man's apartment, my boyfriend was confused, said ""Okay man"" and got in his car and started driving to work. He called me on the way and told me to make sure the deadbolt was locked. I did and told him to call the non emergency line (Note: At this time, we just thought this dude was victim of a break in and thought my boyfriend was part of it, we had no idea what was going on here). So he called them, they said they'd send someone over and to be home by 2 so we could give our statement. 

The roommate and I go about our day, listening to the banging, semi worried, mostly focused on applying for jobs (both of us recently unemployed). I'm more concerned than our roommate, but just waited for the cop to get here. 

Boyfriend comes back at noon, the banging stops at 1PM, at 2PM a cop comes over. She comes in, listens to our side of things (""We dont know this dude"",""weird noises last night"" ""threatened to kill me if i ever went into his apartment, I've never been in there"",etc), and goes up to talk to the neighbor. 

40 minutes go by. We can hear them through the floor, which really should have been a clue that the floor's structural integrity wasn't how it used to be. 

After 40 minutes, she comes back down and knocks on our door. We open the door for her, and she comes back in, turns around and deadbolts the door immediately. I'll never forget how she turned back to us and said ""Holy shit guys, its so much worse than we thought."" because that was the LAST thing I'd ever want a cop to say. I remember I burst out laughing. At the time life had been really rough on me and this just felt like a kick to the nuts. Of course it was worse than we thought. 

So I can't remember everything, there was a lot, but basically she went up there and this guy had FIVE locks on his door, that he himself had installed. He was VERY excited that a cop had ""finally"" come to help him. He claimed several things, but the ones that I can remember were that we had been floating (yes, floating) through the ceiling, whispering to him about how we would ""get"" him, how no one would ever believe him, how they'd never find his body, he claimed we had been sexually assaulting him every night, we've been spying on him and had put cameras in his apartment, he just couldn't find them because they were imperceivably small. How'd we get them in there? Well when we floated in there. Also that we had stolen his watch, his belt and had been drinking the milk from his fridge. 

So that knocking noise we had been hearing, from 3:30AM to about 1PM - well apparently he had decided he had had enough and ripped up all the carpet in the apartment and began digging a hole into his floor/our ceiling, to ""take care of the three punks downstairs"" and if the cops didn't do something about it, ""\[he\] would do what he needed to do, they needed to be stopped"" - based on his threat to my boyfriend, we took this to mean he planned on killing all of us. 

Oh, and what we thought were rats? Yeah turns out that he wanted to counter spy on us and had bought cameras and had been pushing them down the vents to try and spy on us. The  vents were in the bathrooms. I try not to think about it too much cuz the idea that this guy had footage of my 11PM shits and shower snot rockets (and you know, my naked body) is too creepy. The cop said the cameras he got weren't good quality nor were they hooked up to any sort of device that could save all the footage but still.

Not sure if this psychologically makes a difference. But I've read that snipers often go through a lot of mental stress because they're ""closer"" to the enemy than other soldiers.

I'm slightly shaking, partially out of terror but mostly from rage. Thankfully the cop is trained in mental health crisis, but this is a doozy even for her. She said the creepiet thing is the man APPEARED sound of mind. If it wasn't for the five locks on the door and  talking about us floating through the floor, he didn't come off like a lunatic. He had a job. He had no record (she checked) of mental health or criminal issues, though he did come from out of state, so we dont really know his background. 

  
So she tells us the game plan. In our state, if she admitted him involuntarily today, they would have to take his accusations seriously. He apparently wanted a rape kit done on him. If they did that, we would be continually exposed to this guy, and the cop could tell we were just knocked out of left field by this. It'd be months or YEARS of this following us around. So instead, she told us she would tell our apartment we needed to break lease and emergency vacate the apartment (the apartment had been notified at this point that this dude had ripped up the carpet and several light fixtures). Due to tennant laws in our state, they couldn't evict him immediately, but she could get us away from him immediately and she knew if we stayed he would eventually attack us. So what we had to do was vacate the apartment and get a restraining order. Because my boyfriend was technically the only one on the lease, he had to go get the restraining order. So he had to leave, and the cop had to leave to go with him and report to the judge.  She said she had called backup, but because this guy hadn't even technically gotten in, we had to wait for some cops to get done with other calls and get to us. The reason this needed to happen this way and with this timeline, was because if we got a restraining order first, and THEN he was admitted after we left the apartment, when they admitted him and he said ""my downstairs neighbors were r\*ping me"" the cop could say ""He doesn't have downstairs neighbors and the ones he did have have a restraining order against him"". It was the best way to protect us from dealing with it for years. But it meant leaving me and my roommate alone in the apartment. 

Before she left with my boyfriend to get the restraining order (This took a total of SIX HOURS because at this point it was 4PM on a Friday and the judge supposed to take care of our district had already left by the time they got to the courthouse. The whole time my boyfriends phone was dying so I had no clue when he'd get back) she asked if we had a gun on hand. We said yes - my boyfriends shotgun. She asked if I or the roommate knew how to use it, I said I did. In fact a month ago I had learned from a friend in the coast guard how to combat load it. She told me to keep it on hand but out of reach from the door. She had lied to the neighbor upstairs and claimed to be taking my boyfriend in for questioning, but had no clue if he would stay in his apartment like ordered. Not that that was safe either as he had already decided tunneling to us was a solution to his problems. 

I knew we were in a bad situation because the cop seemed so upset because she couldn't keep us safe. We were in a hard situation. Everyone involved in this was in a difficult situation, even mr crazypants upstairs. 

So that's how I sat, holding a shotgun in my lap for about six hours, next to my roommate, waiting for the crazy person upstairs to realize a door was much thinner and easier to get through than a floor-ceiling. And realized in that moment that if he came through the door, I was going to pull that trigger. That was honestly more traumatizing than realizing someone wanted to kill me - realizing that I was willing to kill them back. I think about that moment a lot, especially around the anniversary. It makes me feel cold in my soul. It takes something different inside someone to take a life, even in self defense, and you don't know its inside you until you're there. I haven't been able to watch the Life of Pi since, because I know what its like, having that Tiger on the boat (assuming you subscribe to that metaphorical interpretation). It's been five years and I still feel weird about that knowledge of myself now. 

To sum up the ending of a very, very long story, after six hours my boyfriend got the restraining order and the cops escorted us out of the apartment. We had just our backpacks, my medications, and the shotgun. We slept on several friends couches for two weeks while we tried to find a new apartment (and we did, eventually going back for our stuff). The first night I didn't sleep at all, just laid down next to my friends two puppies petting them, listening to my roommate and boyfriend snore. Last I had heard they were admitting mr crazy pants to a psychiatric hospital. That was five years ago and to be honest, I didn't really care to pursue it and just wanted as far away from it as possible.

I've now married said boyfriend and still am great friends with the roommate (who now has a girlfriend himself and god they're so cute together). Hilariously the \*NEXT\* upstairs neighbor (the one that ordered takeout every weekend and scared me haha) ended up being a therapist and helped me find a good one. I'm also god-mom to his dogs and he ended up playing Led Zeplin as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. So not all my neighbors have been bad lol

I just wanted to end by saying, I do not feel hatred towards the neighbor. I mostly feel pity. He thought we were torturing him, and if someone had been floating up and sexually assaulting me, I probably also would want to kill them. However I also do not feel guilt about holding a shotgun ready to shoot him, and I would not have felt guilty about shooting him if I had to. He was the one threatening to kill us after all and I'm sure if he had managed to kill my husband I probably WOULD hate him. I still cannot put into words how I exactly feel about it. My hope is he got help, somehow, and never put anyone else in danger. 

Hope you enjoyed the ride. I keep telling myself I'll put it on youtube but never get around to it lol",1647304309.0,13
