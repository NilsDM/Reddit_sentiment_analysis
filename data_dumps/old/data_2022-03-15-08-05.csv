By analyzing the pant using a sonograph, this pant varies with bursts of frequencies. When this vocalization is played to dogs in a shelter setting, it can initiate play, promote pro-social behavior, and decrease stress levels. One study compared the behaviour of 120 dogs with and without exposure to a recorded ""dog-laugh"". Playback reduced stress-related behaviors, increased tail wagging, the display of a ""play-face"" when playing was initiated, and pro-social behavior such as approaching and lip licking.[[12]]

So they played the dog version of a laugh track to other dogs, and those dogs were more likely to do fun-related behaviors as a result. Sounds like it works like a human laugh to me.",1647345657.0,2

2. A sudden change in mental status - “do you know where you are? Do you what today is? Do you know who the president is?”

3. Shortness of breath with chest pain (especially if you had recent surgery) - this could be a sign of a blood clot or if it moves to the lungs, a pulmonary embolism. 

More often than not, you need to go to your doctor or an urgent care. However, I can’t tell you how many times a night I say, “it’s a good thing you came in, you made the right choice”

536,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,4718,9847,0.94,"I'm fine now, but:

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind’s rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being “normal,” be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, “Well, now you’re just like the rest of us,” meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present “normal” self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

EDIT: There are a lot of replies about the ER doctor being called an idiot, so let me clarify. Firstly, the Neurologist called him an idiot, not me. I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests.

Except you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.  
  
Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)  
  
You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.  
  
The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.  
  
It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?  
  
At this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.  
  
(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).  
  
There's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.  
  
Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.  
  
So what does that look like?  
  
Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your ""pons"" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.  
  
Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.  
  
As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.  
  
You're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.  
  
You're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.  
  
You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.  
  
You're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you ""drink something"" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.  
  
Eventually, you slip into the ""dumb rabies"" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.  
  
Then you die. Always, you die.  
  
And there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.  
  
Then there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.",1647343394.0,52

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn’t sleep. Didn’t need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn’t focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn’t remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I’ve described seek medical attention.

It’s been two years almost now since that event and I’m still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight. I’m talking 80 pounds or so. I’ve been through a few other medications and psychiatrists and think I’ve finally found one who understands what the drug interaction did. I don’t know for sure if Im actually bipolar or if it was the drugs but I have been safely off of medication for months now and feel ok.

GPs should really be under some kind of obligation to keep up to date with advancements in medicine. Obviously they can't be expected to learn *every* new thing, but you'd think if it was important enough to earn a Nobel prize that my doctor would have at least heard of it.

Not sure). Salt, dried or fresh dill, rosemary, and heavy cream. Can also use a half sweet walla walla onion but with the leeks can be too much…

Sauté bacon with cut leeks in some olive oil. Salt generously. When leeks are soft and bacon crispy, put in pot with broth and potatoes. Bring to boil, keep on boil for 10 minutes or until biggest chunks of potato are soft. Turn heat down before next step.

Using slotted spoon, pull out about 1/3 of the potatoes, put in blender with 1 cup heavy cream, blend until smooth. If heat is now simmer temp, add blended potatoes slowly back into broth (while stirring) with dill and rosemary. Simmer at medium to med-low while stirring for 15-20 minutes, longer with lower temp (but you MUST keep stirring or the cream will curdle and while it doesn’t change the taste much the texture is nasty)

Then she got her friend (yes the same one) to hook up with my buddy, who then convinced him to invite her to a party at his house I went to. I went into the bathroom and when I opened the door she was standing there. Freaked me the fuck out. I said “hi, excuse me, I’m about to leave this house” when she pushed me as hard as she could back into the bathroom and came in and locked the door. At this point I freaked out and just started yelling for help. My buddy and a few others came and unlocked the door and pulled her out and I was able to get out of the bathroom. I started walking upstairs to head to the door and get in my truck to leave, when she flies out the door, and runs to my truck. She stands there while I am standing there in disbelief. At this point we had been broken up for months. I walk back inside and one of her friends approached me and told me if I told her, the friend, that I never wanted to see or talk to my ex again she would let me leave. I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving. 
This all happened after she did the following.
1) called me hundreds of times from a dozen numbers to which I blocked and requested she doesn’t call
2) egged new girlfriends car
3) tried to get me to do threesome
4) tried to make me fuck buddies
5) asked a very desperate friend of mine to prom hoping to get in our group
6) followed me to work, home

Two years later, I have a new phone number and am I’m college. I get a call and answer it. It’s her. No idea how she found me. She asked if I went to the local university to which I replied yes. I did not actually go there, I went to a state college. She enrolled in that university. 

That’s the end of that story

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn’t ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn’t believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn’t have money at the time, so I didn’t want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they’d release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I’d been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I’d been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn’t have to pay a fine or take DUI classes. 

I have no idea what the hell is wrong with my friend who pranked me. He did apologize and felt bad, but I stopped hanging out with him after that.",1647306662.0,10263

But no matter how ill I had felt not long after he would get to my house I would start feeling good almost giddy. 

But our realationship seemed to be progressing nicely. We were redecorating the house ripping fireplaces out and getting rid of furniture and carpets.

Anyway it turns out that his intentions when he met me were very different to mine.

He had wooed me not because he saw us having a future together but because I owned my own house.

You see, before he met me he had gone from being a good little church boy to a druggy. This was ruining his marriage and his relationship with his kids. So he decided to find some wh\*re that owned her own house and get her to sign it over to him then overdose her. That way he could run his drug business from the house but without it being connected back to his kids and family home. We'd been decorating the house so that he could move into it. My mystery illness was him drugging me.

After I finished with him I was devastated. And going cold turkey. Meanwhile my family had decided I was a drug addict (voluntary) and turned on me. For years everytime I spoke I was called a druggy liar. I was'nt lying. Every family problem somehow became my fault even if I wasnt there. If they misplaced something Id stolen it and mom would search my bags, screaming accusations at me. I never stole anything. I developed neuralgia, one symptom was loud noises would make me pass out from pain, my mother would scream in my face making me pass out repeatedly.

Except, this was a hired driver from the firm I used to work at that dropped us off at the strip club after I explicitly said I didn’t want to go. It was my 21st birthday and I was hammered - everyone else already went home. He kept shoving drinks down my throat and shoveling drinks my way. 

I was in a short dress and drunk. He just left me alone in the strip club and men were starting to notice and approach me. After I confronted him outside for leaving me - he just took off running, I mean SPRINTING. I followed him because hello, drunk and dumb 21 year old me didn’t know what to do so he shoved me and I wet myself because of how hard he pushed me. 

Dozens of people saw this go down and I was bleeding from both knees. Two girls came up to me and asked me if I was okay and offered a ride. I asked who they were and where and why they would help me - they both picked me up and threw me in the car and tried to fcking kidnap me. They thought I was so intoxicated I couldn’t defend myself. I demanded to be let out of the car multiple times and finally I realized I had my cell phone. I called 911 on speakerphone and told them I was being taken, they slammed the brakes and threw me out and sped off. 

At this point, it’s well past 3am and I’m soiled, alone and realizing what happened. His friend’s girlfriend came to pick me up and begged me not to go back. 

I did. For another five months before he beat me so bad I had welts all over my head and I was arrested for calling the police on HIM.",1647318967.0,122

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

At first I was in a panic thinking something bad had happened to my BIL but no… they were just fighting over something petty. Apparently her plan was to do what your ex did and trash my BIL to my MIL and make me an accessory in the process, thinking that I’d give her the number and side with her .. I did not give her the fucking number and chewed her a new Asshole for trying to start drama at 2am. To this day idk why she not only thought I’d help her but that my MIL would side with her.. They were both barely 18. Me and her were not close. My MIL was definitely not a fan. A month prior she had blown up my phone to the point it died while I was getting married!! She wanted me to leave my own wedding to pick her up and bring her!!! Even though the ceremony was family only and she knew that!! So she was already on my shit list and we were all fully aware she was nuts. At the time of the 2am phone call They’d only been together 2 months and She was extremely narcissistic and there was already a list of psycho shit she’d done and said to us. He wanted to leave her because she was controlling and isolating him from friends and family but she was not having that.  It took him 2 more months to leave her. She held his things ransom to the point we had to intervene and get his stuff ourselves. She made a huge scene. Scream/cried in the middle of the street. In a horribly manipulative attempt to gain sympathy she Told my prudish MIL that my BIL was using her for sex… it was bad. She called me from different numbers and would hang up for months after they broke up. I told my brother-in-law to use this as a teaching moment.

It's an experience and a story with joyful charisma. Paid product endorsements are how these ppl make money. Sometimes it's a passive side income, other times it's paying the bills.

I do agree however that there should be an option for those who want to cut to the chase, and that sometimes food bloggers prattle on too much about topics and themes unrelated to the story behind the recipe.

To directly answer OP's question, a cookbook (physical or ebook) is your best bet IMO.

I remember that i cried that day. I dont remember why, my parents told me its because anday erlier my brother went to another city, and i dont want him to leave me.

There is this one girl, i dont remember her face or her name at all, i dont even know id she is still going to that church.
She comes, and she talked to me, she calm me down and pray together with me.

Im not that religious, although i still remember that moment.
Its not a big thing, she just calm down a kid, and in a way that she know and i know at the time, praying.
She isnt an adult either, i remember her being teen-like, maybe around 14-16 years old.

I dont think that person realize how much she effect my life.
We dont know when or whos life we can effect, and im sure most of the time we have no idea we did just that, over very small things. Like simply smiling to strangers, or go ask your old friend whats up.

If trying to live another day gave me just a small chance for me to do just that for someone else, im gonna try to hold into that, so maybe i can somehow lessen someone else's struggle, even when no one notice it, including me and them.

When I was completely alone at the house I went for the gun and sat down, thinking about it. In my mind at the moment, I couldn't find any reason not to do it, so I pulled the trigger. 

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"".

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren’t appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don’t we spend more time with them, why don’t we go out more, why don’t we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don’t do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven’t done it yet, I probably won’t ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,75

My ex died last August from a drug overdose in the woods. Well honestly in an empty lot next to a construction site. It was egregious and terrible and brutal for him, and not the way any human being should be photographed by police or remembered by their parents. 

Was it a drug overdose as suicide? Was it a garden variety drug overdose? I think there's a 90% chance it was overdose as suicide, his mother doesn't feel that and I would never try to change her mind. 

Regardless of the method though, even if it had been some magical peaceful method (and you know it's a cruel joke that mother nature makes damn sure it's impossible to kill ourselves peacefully) it wasn't about the photographs or what his mother had to see. 

It was the fact her child was taken from her. Adult child but still her son. The people we are put here in the world to love beyond all reason and protect and guide into the future beyond us. It breaks a person. 

She thinks about him everyday. She hurts everyday. I check in on her occasionally and we touch base. There's not going to be a day that goes by in her life that she doesn't think of her dead son. And there have been a very few days between August and today that I haven't thought about him. 

Even though I have an extremely demanding life and a child and so many responsibilities I can't get everything done.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1142

Wich means, that as game developpement progress and as resolution increase, we could maybe see more and more scopes realistically rendered in fps.

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

Moreover I also have a technical question for the devs out there : if you decide to render a second scene for the scope, does it typically don't add any load on the gpu, since it also stops rendering a similar area on the ""main"" image ?",1647347952.0,3

I grew up with COD and occasionally buy the new one when I start missing it, let me tell you the next gaming generation is going to be extremely competitive if all multiplayer games continue with the current path.

So apparently in COD Cold War people complained that snipers “scoped too fast” so ads time was increased and attachments were changed or taken away on snipers. It wasn’t too bad and you could still quick scope but that created another issue, people bitching about quick scoping in game. Apparently it’s frowned upon to quick scope in COD.

* It had the worst maps of any cod game to date. Far too big. The one remedy for large maps is ground war yet that wasn't released on the old gen consoles which most people had at the time. 

* One of BO2's best features was the introduction of League Play, a massively popular gamemode. It took IW a couple of months to put in a worse version of it into their game. 
 
* The sniping as mentioned in this thread - awful. 

* Then the worst one, removing SnD?? I understand they added it in after a month or so but that was too late. You can't just remove one of your top 3 most popular and iconic gamemodes.

Also side tangent, am I the only one who thinks that WWII Shipment actually played really well for it being a shipment recreation?

Older games typically had fairly basic lighting processes, that would light in-game objects on the spot, as they were being rendered. It was trivial to generate reflections back then, because you could afford to re-render each object along the reflection plane (the location and angle that objects are reflected at), due to how basic the lighting processes were.

Nowadays, we have far more complex lighting processes that take place well after in-game objects are rendered, across many passes. We have one pass done at half resolution to compute the ambient occlusion across the entire screen, another half resolution pass to compute an approximation of global illumination, a third full resolution pass to compute shadowing, then a fourth to combine everything and light every object on screen in one go.

Because of this, generating reflections isn't as easy as it was back then. You'd essentially need to repeat this same process again, except on the reflected geometry, potentially many times over for each reflection plane you desire. This would obviously cripple performance, so alternative methods had to be devised, and the most common is screen-space reflections.

Screen-space reflections reuse what's already been rendered to the screen, to avoid having to repeat all lighting processes. This makes generating reflections quite fast, but comes with the downside that only the things that have been rendered to the screen can be reflected, and the moment they go off screen, they stop being reflected.

Because of this, screen-space reflections need another method to fall back onto, and that's typically some form of cubemap or environment probes. Put simply, these are 360 degree renders of the game world at different locations, that have similar lighting processes to old games (to make generating them nice and quick). When screen-space reflections fail, they can instead fall back to either of these, and while they both aren't as accurate, they are convincing enough during gameplay.

Now with hardware-accelerated raytracing (ie RTX), there's a new alternative (or even fall back method) to screen-space reflections, that use a similar principle to older reflections, except they support an infinite number of reflection planes while maintaining a fixed performance cost.",1647348612.0,2

It is still pretty convincing! Plus no major performance impact like a real dual render.",1647354033.0,2

A friend of mine claims she doesn't let her kid go to the park because there are more dangerous people out there than there were thirty years ago. But honestly, I think the internet has just made people more aware of it. Child abductions are 40 percent lower today than they were in the 90s - and murders of individuals under 14 are the lowest they've ever been. The 70s-90s were way more dangerous and we just did our thing.",1647337126.0,10

I think it's just that kids today socialize differently when they're between 10-15. It IS sad from my perspective but my perspective doesnt matter to them - and it shouldnt. They experience things we never did, that will define their childhoods (Roblox, VR Chat with their friends etc) and I guess Im just not willing to play the grumpy old ""back in my day"" type. Things change and have always done so.

I have a 3 year old and honestly, his age up until say 8-10, kids play outside for sure. Basketball, pokemon Go:ing, soccer etc. Not as much as we did, but we didnt have an option. But when they get a bit older and are more into socializing with their friends beyond just playing, the internet experience is their place.

With all THAT said, I totally agree that around 1995-2005 were peak childhood time. We had technology, but not enough of it for it to totally take over.",1647340889.0,1

Good weather days were spent on bikes, skateboards or disappearing off to the park, shops or places kids probably shouldn't have been going. Bad weather days where our parents would have had to sit around reading saw us just being lost in video games and watching cartoons that were equally as groundbreaking as that industry had a renaissance of its own around that time too. There was rarely nothing to do unless you were on a long car trip without a Game Boy. You did what you did because it was fun, not because you thought it would get likes on social media and it was enough just to be one of the best in school at something.

&#x200B;

And with the economy being more fair on the working class then we kinda ""had more"" too. Half the people I associated with back then had swimming pools at their place. We didn't have one but we always had somewhere to swim in summer without having to go to a public pool. I feel like you need to be a millionaire to afford such an ""unnecessary"" luxury now.  Big backyards were common. Food and snack portions were bigger and tasted better before corporate assholery shrunk them down, switched to cheaper ingredients and jacked up the price to satisfy their lust for endlessly increasing profit margins year after year. I'll never have a 90's era Crème Egg again - today they're half the size, three times the price and aren't nearly as delicious as they used to be. Movies and music were just pumping out hits that didn't all look and sound the same - the blockbusters and chat toppers always had something for everyone and it wasn't just Disney making all the money. There was so much optimism for the future too, like our parents were the last generation to really endure any shit and sacrifice (after all they walked to school uphill both ways lol) but by the time we grew up we were going to enter a utopia, whereas now it feels like the world is just one more fuck-up away from ending.

WW1 ended 1918, subtract that from her current age and she is literally the original (and likely oldest) WW1 baby boomer alive.

My own cooking is something I've developed over the years and was mostly self taught.

I'm sure it would be great to have an Italian nonna who is an amazing cook but I never did so it's what it is. But when I'm with my parents (who live interstate) I'm still happy for them to do most of the cooking because it gives me a break from cooking for myself all the time.",1647332486.0,24

So I to the fridge and there was two 40's of Mickey's Ice, two tall boys of Natty Ice, like a single can of really good local IPA, and a bottle of radioactive pink Mad Dog 20/20. I asked my uncle ""Are we sure he doesn't drink? This is the fridge of a broke alcoholic, not like a selection for guests"". But apparently when his nurse came to take him to the store once a week he would just go to the gas station and pick up beers/ wine coolers if he knew he was having guests. He didn't get visitors that often. So when I moved to the same city he was in, I would go over there and watch baseball games with him, order pizza for us, and drink 40's of Mickey's Ice, lol.

There's a reason why Shania Twain and Clay Aiken aren't still pumping out at least passable good music, but Madonna is. Madonna works with the best. Always. Fresh, new, new sounds, beautiful tracks. It's possible for Dolly, and even a Britney Spears, if they get a fresh new crew. Honestly, I'd only trust Madonna to manage teams for older stars, as odd as that is to say. She's has the best track record and longevity and an uncanny ear for the next new sound under her belt. She can hear or see something totally new and just know how it will work.

Dolly re-did Old Flames beautifully with Keshsa on her ""I'm a real artist"" album. Jack White blew his pud on Loretta Lynn. I would suggest someone who still has a fight in their belly. A great writer and lover of Dolly. The writer would have to know her, and still have a fight. As risky as this sounds, I'd hire Diane Warren to co-write, and Madonna to produce. Diane has such an ear, and so does Madonna. Plus neither put out crap. It would cost a fortune, but it would be gorgeous.",1647324867.0,5

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that. Duplantier's ability to shift from growls to clean vocals offers interesting interplay with Parton's high, gentle voice and his solid groove in his rhythm playing would provide a great drive.",1647314465.0,2

Subsequently, the memorabilia, including the jockstrap, were **donated to the last operating Alaskan Blockbuster Video store in Anchorage**.[4][10] The jockstrap remained there in a glass case along with other items from the Crowe auction and became a local attraction.[10] However, the items failed to prevent the store from closing in July 2018.[11] Afterwards, the owners of the Alaska store **sent all their memorabilia to** the last remaining Blockbuster Video store in the United States, located in **Bend, Oregon**.[12] However, **Crowe's jockstrap was missing** from the items sent to this store, with Oliver claiming in September 2018 that he **did not know its location**.""

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

5446,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,648,16150,0.94,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

I'm appalled at the effects of Russian money in our elections and political campaigns. Sadly, we can't call the police to do anything about it now, we don't have that option.

Did Deripaska use the normal process for removing a squatter?

> The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

> After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

> * leave your property within 24 hours  
> * stay away from your property for 12 months

> To get final possession of the property, you must make a claim for possession.

No, they broke the door open and arrested them for trespass. So, actually, I'm more appalled that Russian Oligarchs who are sanctioned get more favourable treatment than British home-owners, who have to get a court IPO to have squatters removed.

So then Reddit is happy when refugees take the property of the rich? Most Americans are considered exorbitantly rich compared to the average citizen of India or Honduras. If your best friend had a vacation house in Greece, would you rejoice if Greek activists broke into it to house Syrian refugees, and the police seemed to be supporting them, and that it is justified because your friend is considered rich and it's his government's fault there is war?

If you say, ""This guy is rich so he can handle it,"" you could probably handle it if someone stole $100 from you, but how would you feel if they did?

What I see is that the happiness in the comments is either racist ""fuck this guy who is Russian because his government did something bad"" or (more likely I think) hypocritical jealousy ""fuck this guy who has more than I do.""

The report also states that Manafort was sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, though investigators couldn't determine why. The report outlines Kilimnik in contact with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, trying to resolve an issue involving Manafort owing a debt to Deripaska. The report goes on to state that the Russian oligarch wanted Manafort to advance Deripaska's interests in the event that Trump won the election. It should also be noted that following the election President Trump dropped sanctions on certain companies that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska's bottom line, though no direct link was established in the Mueller Report.**


*Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[1]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)*


>The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort **[redacted]** did not see a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

>...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, **[redacted].** Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 

>Gate's account about polling data is consistent **[redacted]** with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, **[redacted].**

>The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:

>> *I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.*

>> *Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]*

>Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.

**Furthermore, after being elected the Trump administration removed sanctions from Russian entities that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)**

>The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.

>...The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from stray dog rescue to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.

>The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal’s biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.

>And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.

>In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them — in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.

>Notably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.

>...The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.

>Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.

>...Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.

>“Score that a win for Putin,” tweeted Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.

Btw, sorry to interrupt, there's a rumor circulating (in the fog of war i'm not sure rn) that zelenskyy wanted to cancel all taxes in ukraine in the war economy; still while it makes sense it's hard to check now have they checked whether their budget close ? :x Not sure it does; and they still need to pay their men (and pensions, emergencies, foreign deliveries etc) and basic services to keep society running on its footing. And prolly the billionaires and ultrawealthy should be put to contribution to some degree :/ in french they say that money is the nerve of war (or can the EU prop up a bit their funding?)

edit i'd probably add a provision in the martial law too that fighters/soldiers can't be foreclosed/evicted (loose their home) due to unpaid/unpayble bills too right now :x

edit i'm concerned some oligarchs are trying to loot the state budget in the middle of the war, and are helped by some equally questionable republicans

Virtually anyone who uses a computer can access western news, if by ""actual"" you imply pluralism.

Your notion of ""mouth to mouth"" makes it seem like you view Russia as some stone-age country without civil telecom, but it's not. Despite ""western"" internet-services massively banning Russian users, internet is still acessable. And there are thousands of ""publics"" that report and aggregate global and domestic news.

> do they actually really dont know anything or do many of them know full well but dont really care or do anything against it

We know enough. Even more than what gets reported in ""western"" news. But what of it? There is a wierd sentiment that I see in the western part of the internet which is that people expect Russians to do some kind of miracle, that even Americans were not capable of regarding the US invasion of Iraq in their supposedly free and democratic society.

Like, how is this even supposed to work, that you show Russians videos of ""army shelling cities"" (some of which are actually recycled older videos from Donetsk, that were already presented to Russian audience as ""evidence of Ukrainian agression in Donbas"" few years ago), and they will wave their magic wand, and all the war, strife, hunger and famine suddenly disappear?

Wrong:

>However, since many live events became available via social media in the late 2000s, tape delays have become increasingly irrelevant because of live television's resurgence as a broadcast format. **Since the mid-2010s, several high-profile entertainment programs with huge live global audiences** like the Academy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Grammy Awards, yearly specials like the Miss Universe and Miss World pageants, and major sporting events like the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and the National Football League's Super Bowl, **air to totality live on both television and the internet virtually all across the world's time zones** in and out of their countries of origin, with mandated prime time rebroadcasts (featuring edits as desired by broadcasters) for regions that previously and solely relied on delayed telecasts on prime time among these otherwise live events.

 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

I was a college kid. Not even a political science major. Was just simply interested in the way government really worked. WAsn't doing it for the reference letter or any big future connection (since I had no ambition to work in politics at all). 

I just wanted to see American government for myself. 

And holy SHIT.

What a bunch of shitbags.

I worked 100 feet from Newt Gingrich. (This was in the 90s; I was in Rayburn.) I went to the Congressional dining room all the time. Gave tours of the Capitol. Did all that shit. And every second of it was like bathing in oil and spit. 

One fun thing I got to do:

I'd never worked an office phone before. Or a fax. And I kept fuckign them up. 

One day Jack Kemp called for my boss. 

""Yes, sir, Mr. Kemp,"" I said. ""I'll put you right through.""

And then I pushed---or thought I pushed---the connect-call button. But somehow I fucked it up.

And hung up on him.

I hung up on Jack Kemp.

He called back.

""So sorry, sir,"" I said. ""We've been having trouble with these phones all week. I'll put you right through.""

Then I did it again.

He called back again.

I gave him some line again.

Tried again. 

Hung up on him again.

THRICE I hung up on Jack Kemp. 

Finally, almost in tears, I had to beg another intern---one who hated me---to do it for me. 

Because I was too stupid.

the issue is you dont know what other lies the officers / leaders of the russian army tells the badly trained and probably just conscripted people.

I mean so far they claimed ukraine are nazis , then they claimed they want to nuke their Power plant , then they claimed they have found bio weapons in ukraine... and what not what i probably missed a few more lies ah yeah i forgot that the ukrainian russians want to be Liberated ( a secret tip no they dont want to and they also get killed by russia in the bombings and more ).

meanwhile  we know of tons of lies wouldnt it be so far off if they get told the ""nazi / Bio / Nuclear terrorist""  or whatever other lie they spring out next Regime of ukraine would use civil suicide cars or whatever? + if badly trained people panic stuff happens.

&#x200B;

so it could be just a command to kill civilians true i absolutely also heard these reports from russia.

&#x200B;

Dont forget from what we ""know"" ( as far as we random people can speak about knowing ) by refugee reports and soldiers calling their moms most russian soldiers or atleast a sizeable part **doesnt want this shit show either.**

Now we heard reports that russia also uses kill squads again ( Kommisar ) which will kill traitors on the spot.

Now imagine you are a young dude getting conscripted suddenly or just being one badly trained thrown under lies and no expection into a war you dont want probably hear whats going on at home with the arrests and issues and then probably seeing also Kommisars literarily threatening you with death from your own country?

**Just stop typing or imagining a angry comment under this of mine and just ""imagine"" this for a few seconds try to be a conscript right now of russia what way out would you see ?** its not like you can call russia and say you dont want to fight but theres also no easy way to just go through the frontline and surrender or call ukraine because they even took their phones and stuff i heard.

we also heard from a Captured russian Pilot that he got told its military targets  but when he saw its civilians he doubted it but fired anyway yes its bad but what other choice did he have ? casually flying over to a ukraine air port ? really doubt that , not firing ? and ending up in jail or torture ? probably even his family?

&#x200B;

Theres more than just ""Soldier bad"" going on

**the leadership and officials are 100% at fault the average soldier ? ""maybe"" but not 100%**

i know  there are also diehard russia and putin fans in the army of russia but dont forget the plenty that dont want it.

war is ugly and it simply needs to stop somehow **its easy to condemn the simple ""pawns"" in a war from outside but its really shitty overall.**

I wrote a response but it seems the comment was deleted. I'll leave it here just in case anyone else is genuinely wondering:


Several factors lead to their issues, from what we can tell.

Firstly, ahead of the invasion there were reports of Russian soldiers selling off the extra fuel and supplies they were given for what they thought would be training exercises in Belarus. The story is they weren't told long enough in advance that the extra supplies would actually be needed for going to war, so when the time came to invade it was too late for  many of their soldiers / vehicle operators who'd decided to make a quick buck by selling the extra fuel and food they'd been given to the locals they were camped near. 


Secondly, Russia couldn't have expected the conflict to last as long as it has, as even before the invasion they didn't have the logistics capacity needed to keep their army supplied in the field. Inside their borders isn't a problem as they make great use of their extensive railway system to move units and supplies around quickly, however, Russia simply never had the number of supply and fuel trucks necessary to keep their army fully fed, fueled and armed in the field. Between food, fuel, and munitions, something has to take priority, meaning something else invariably gets neglected. When soldiers have no food they start looting homes and stores or begging from locals, and when they have no fuel or ammunition they simply abandon their equipment and either surrender or hitch a ride back to their lines. 


Thirdly, Ukrainian forces have done an excellent job of exploiting and exacerbating Russia's logistics issues by targeting supply convoys mercilessly. They've been so effective that Russia's been forced to use civilian trucks to replace losses, which isn't ideal as you can imagine.


Basically, what it boils down to, is even if they do have all the fuel and supplies necessary to achieve their objectives, they simply can't get it to their forward-most troops fast enough to replace their losses.",1647354350.0,1

 >Denazification (German: Entnazifizierung) was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the Nazi ideology following the Second World War. It was carried out by removing those who had been Nazi Party or SS members from positions of power and influence and by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with Nazism. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the war and was solidified by the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn’t be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie. Sometimes I think my laughter just became so infectious because it was so cathartic and uproariously uncontainable. The movie would not be denied, I hadn’t laughed that hard for eons and when “you’re not supposed to”, that made it even funnier and more taboo - and even funnier. Damn it, that little film was so clever and raw and manic and goofy and terrifying it will always hold a special place in my heart.   
  
( I always believed that Raimi and Co. should have definitely went with their first choice in the Evil Dead II’s sequel’s name, *Medieval Dead* as that’s what and where it ended up…and was as inspired n’ whacky as the franchise. )",1647329012.0,4

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

He was however, allowed to make a sequel. He elected to go ahead and film Evil Dead II as a remake and then tack 10 minutes of exposition on at the beginning to technically make it a sequel - so your method is pretty spot on for how it was intended to be watched.

Those ten minutes are the part he compromised to get it greenlit, everything else was all him. 

People tend to talk down Evil Dead but I think both are excellent, just different vibes. You can't deny that Evil Dead is fucking crazy impressive for how it was produced and the history, and Evil Dead II is the payoff where those crazy kids got to come back to their baby and do it with some budget and some actual understanding of how films are made lol.",1647344555.0,1

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90’s.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

And just look at The Fellowship of the Ring! That is a gory ass movie. Had the Orcs and Goblins been humans it would've been a hard R, but because they're fantasy creatures that bleed black it could be PG-13.",1647311622.0,96

There’s horror all over the series. The books are very scary. Mordor and Sauron’s primary power is literal terror. 

What other kind of director can showcase an “inanimate object” negatively affecting everyone and everything around it? To give you a sense of fear and dread up front of what it would mean to the world if this power was unleashed. 

There are so many epic heroic moments. They all stand on the foundation of confronting and facing the terror. To be a literal little person in a big world and stand up to the evil.

Last year my brother and I watched the same movie in the same theater.  Everyone was super tense and quiet.  A girl and her date noped out at the beginning of the second act right about the time the sister starts calling out the cards.

This time, the crowd was way more into the comedic timing of it and was laughing at how serious the characters were treating the over the top absurdity of it.

It’s beautifully animated, but the story is weak and kind of nonsensical. The music is alright, most of the songs are pretty catchy (“We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is overrated AF, and the best song is the one She-Hulk sings), but mostly sound like generic pop music with a radio-friendly structure and sound rather than a theatrical/movie musical structure and sound. The lyrics can get clumsily busy, and I really wanted to hear a soundtrack/score that sounds more Latin American than what was ultimately offered. There’s only a few hints of Latin Jazz, Cumbia, and Habanera here and there. The music just comes across as generic and easily replaced, most of it doesn’t feel like it’s part of the movie. 

   There’s also so many characters in this movie with the writers trying to fully flesh out each one, but it falls flat in a movie made for the attention span of children.  Seriously, there are so many characters it’s impossible to remember all their names unless you’ve seen the movie multiple times. The only name I can remember is Bruno, and only because his name is in a song title. Had to come up with nicknames for them that either describe their powers or their relationships to other characters, like Animal Boy, Brown Poison Ivy, Batgirl, ADHD Nightcrawler, the aforementioned She-Hulk, Narcissistic Grandma, Main Girl, Animal Boy’s Dad, etc. The only character you can remember the name of is the one we’re not allowed to say. 

I know Encanto is a strictly Disney Film and not a Disney Pixar film like Coco, but Coco is far superior  (faaaaaaarrrrrrrrr superior) when it comes to a movie about Latin America, the people who live there, and the importance of family. The plot isn’t muddled and anti-climactic, the music actually feels like it belongs in the movie, and there’s still a large cast of characters, but they’re handled appropriately: you can remember the names of all the characters important to driving the plot, and the rest of the cast is mostly there for support, comic levity, and variety of voices delivering incidental lines.

Also Coco made me cry and want to see it again, and I finished Encanto feeling neutral and uninterested.",1647334879.0,4

The characters go through significant change, potentially some of the most I have seen in a family friendly movie. 

The whole point of the movie is that the grandmother's expectations and desires for the family has been ruining most of their lives. And that demanding outward perfection and hiding problems is harmful. The grandmother learns to see her family for who they are and not who she wants them to be.

For instance you have the aunt who alters the weather when she is upset. But she is told to calm down so she doesn't alter the weather. Rather than anyone wondering why she is upset. Or that Luisa feels inadequate despite constantly helping.",1647343330.0,3

7731,movies,"Disney+ to Release Sing-Along Versions of Animated Classics, Starting with ‘Encanto’",MarvelsGrantMan136,1647294453.0,380,3314,0.9,"I'll just say... the billboard Top 100 is not a consistent metric of determining popularity.  It's not like it is rated just on sales.

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,31

**Another argument against Latinx is that ""it erases feminist movements in the 1970s"" that fought for use of the word Latina to represent women, according to George Cadava, Director of the Latina and Latino Studies program at Northwestern University.[34]

Senior editor of Latino Rebels Hector Luis Alamo describes the term as a ""bulldozing of Spanish"".[10] In a 2015 article, Alamo wrote: ""If we dump Latino for Latinx because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive.""[58]

Wayne State University professor Nicole Trujillo-Pagán has argued that patriarchal bias is reproduced in ostensibly ""gender neutral"" language[59][60][61] and stated, ""Less clear in the debate (as it has developed since then) is how the replacement silences and erases long-standing struggles to recognize the significance of gender difference and sexual violence.""[62]

A 2019 National Survey of Latinos found that only 3% of Hispanic-Latinos have ever used ""Latinx"" to describe themselves.[63]**

If you're expecting politicians to be good sources of information on matters of vaccine science, I can't help you there.

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

>Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property. ""I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist.

This works so so damn well.

[Check this paper. It shows less mobility in the States than in europe. But the perception is its the reverse.](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/02_economic_mobility_sawhill_ch3.pdf)

Its amazing how the propaganda works so well. They get sold the narrative of ""less taxes for the rich"" cause they imagine it opens the way for them as well.

WRONG...

EDIT:

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

Hard work paying off is literally just RNG. My parents worked hard, my relatives, my peers’ parents? All hard workers. Who was the only one who made it out of poverty? My parents. 

They didn’t work harder than my uncles though. I doubt they worked harder than my friends in college or their parents. 

I had class privilege growing up so I was ignorant for a while but in college I got to meet a lot more people and finally started listening to them. 

Being poor is expensive. 

If you start with 3 apples and you’re consistently spending those 3 apples and also bringing in 3 apples, how is it possible for there to be upward mobility? 
And say they cut expenses. Okay cool. But it reaches a point where you really cannot cut down any more. Now you got 1 apple to spare. 

And this is when “life happens” tend to happen. If you own a car, something broke down. An emergency came up. You need new shoes for work cuz your current one is falling apart. Everything you saved up just got wiped.

Not only that, but the shoe example: They can’t splurge on better quality shoes either cuz they can only afford the cheapest ones. And guess what happens? It gets ruined in the future and it repeats. You’re cycling through the same amount of apples no matter what you do. 

As i said there’s only so much you can cut in an effort to save without sacrificing other aspects like your mental health. And even when saving, there are a whole bucket of obstacles that ppl don’t consider: time. 

If you’re born into poverty, chances are, you live further from your work than someone who lives closer to where most work would be. If you live in the suburbs you NEED a car. But regardless if you drive or bus, chances are you are working with a much smaller time frame to do things in your life than the person living in the more expensive place. 

Nothing I said implies that climbing out of poverty isn’t possible. It’s definitely possible. My parents are perfect examples. But with the given information and just looking around, I HIGHLY doubt my parents somehow worked 10x harder than my other relatives or my peers. 

You need hard work AND luck to move up.

Yet, despite this, there appears to be overall very little upward mobility happening and we're currently living through a period of time with economic inequality in the United States bordering on, if not surpassing, the incredible inequality that preceded the French Revolution.

So... what are we supposed to make of this? We can't be lazy and pull a hand wavy ""well nobody wants to work hard!"" because that's nonsense. The only reasonable answer is that upward mobility is not as accessible as we've been led to believe it is. If upward mobility was simply just a day's hard work away, every maid and lineman in America would be moving to Beverly Hills.

And on a personal note, your last sentence really struck me. A million bucks isn't what it used to be and if you can't trade a whole lifetime of labor and investing for a few million bucks these days then maybe you need to revisit what you think upwardly mobile really looks like.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,82

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

>Values have been adjusted for **purchasing power parity** and take into account both the payment of **taxes and social contributions**, and transfers in kind received by households (such **health** or **education** provided for free or at reduced prices by government).

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems?

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,7

The process is called 'priming.' People are more likely to pick something they feel they are familiar with even if they don't remember how or why they became familiar with it in the first place. It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high.

The other study was modern data and you dismissed that.

The other study sucked, for obvious reasons which I explained at length. It's not my fault that the first study was so poorly done, nor that the second study is over two decades old. That's historical data at this point, not a current representation of either the US or Germany's status in 2022.

This last article you linked to (Stockhausen) is the only decent one among the three. It seems to analyze relevant data, although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. It's not nothing, but it's also not very much in absolute terms.

Oddly, the abstract claims that, ""while the majority of German males has been able to share in the country’s rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground."" However, this is directly contradicted by the results themselves, which clearly indicate that well over half of American men earn more than their fathers. The majority of both American and German men are doing better than their fathers.

 Notably, this study does not evaluate the amount of improvement per individual (i.e. only the number of people who earn more, not how much more they earn), nor does it address the downward mobility included in the original study which started this thread.

It didn’t. Your reasons were bad.

Income mobility is, by definition, a measure of parent to child. It must, therefore, span many decades. Generally at least 5 decades, often 6- enough time for the parents earnings to be captured over time, to start. Then for the child to become an adult, and then that adult child to now have a long period of adult earnings to be averaged over time and compared to the averaged over time earnings of the parent.

And it must have good data about both parent, and child, and they must be comparable.

Can you think of Any reason, any at all, why they would predominant use the data of fathers… from 50-60 years ago?

And not mothers? In the 60’s and 70’s? Any reason at all that data about women’s the earnings, in the 60’s and 70’s, might not be great for analysis of societal income mobility?


>nor that the second study is over two decades old. 

Again, these studies must, by definition, span close to half a century. There is no evidence that these types of massive country level trends change quickly.

>although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). 

Does it?

Really?

Give this a good think.

>The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. 

That’s a huge difference.

That also means 40% earn less. Vs 33%.

Swinging 7% of the population from going down to going up means that the amount of income from that 7% is ripped from the hands of the Very top tiers- it can come from nowhere else- and redistributed to the working class.

That’s an enormous amount of overall income / GDP that is more evenly distributed to citizens.

If you think it’s so little, then let’s have the US copy Germany’s much higher taxes and social welfare policies, to drive exactly that outcome.

I took community college classes while in high school. The cost for 1 year worth of classes was like $1000. I think it's up to $2000 right now but you get a fee waiver if you're poor. 

Most of the cost is if you're middle class or rich and want to go to a private school. 

If a German wants to go to Harvard, they pay the same price as an American (actually more) so that's not exactly the right comparison either. 

The right metric really should be cost of education (after scholarships, grants, government subsidies, etc.) vs future income. 

It's about 1.5% of future income. 

And again, the college educated in the US tend to make A LOT more than the college educated in a country like Germany. A LOT MORE. 1.5% is nothing in that comparison.",1647304431.0,3

But put that aside for a second, here are some samples of tuition of public university's in state tuition.

State University of New York - $7070/year  [https://www.suny.edu/smarttrack/tuition-and-fees/](https://www.suny.edu/smarttrack/tuition-and-fees/)

University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA) : $13804 / year [https://admission.ucla.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees](https://admission.ucla.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees)

University of Texas at Austin :  [https://onestop.utexas.edu/managing-costs/cost-tuition-rates/.   ](https://onestop.utexas.edu/managing-costs/cost-tuition-rates/)  $13576/year ($6788/semester)

Even if say, all said and done, your education cost you $50,000 extra in the US compare to in Germany. If the pay in the US is higher by $10,000/year, it will only take 5 years to break even. And in many professional jobs, US wages is significantly higher.

Tech being the biggest example: Median wages for a Software Engineer in Germany  : \~55,000 EUR (61,000 USD) to \~65,000 EUR (71,200 USD) / year ;

Median Software Engineer in the US - \~110,000 USD/ year;

A Nurse in Germany \~33,000 EUR / year (36,100 USD) ; A Nurse in US \~ $75,000 / year

And if so, why does denmark enroll less than half of its citizens in college that America does?

All of this is accounted for, because we are talking about per-capita college enrollment between nations.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

In electronic warfare. The pilot needs the AA battery to turn their RF systems on (like radar and RF guidance for missiles) to geolocate their position, submit it to the rest of the forces, then counter attack *likely before the AA battery even fires*

Their motto is ""YGBSM"" or ""You Gotta Be Sh*ttin' Me"".",DoomGoober,1647306574.0,542,17919,0.95,"This is mainly due to the fact that NATO had a material need for a much more extensive SEAD net to combat the WP, as the WP's doctrine did not count on having air dominance. This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular. After all, NATO, the side with all this hyped-up 'dedicated platforms', still had a hell of a time avoiding losses to obsolete Soviet SAM systems over Yugoslavia",1647343051.0,1

My favorite use of your version of this tactic is in operation desert storm, by BG Larry Henry (call sign Poobah).

He flew un-manned drones towards these sites, and the Iraqis, thinking they were American f-15s and 16s, turned on their radars and fired.

They even triumphantly reported kills!

Meanwhile the AGM-88 HARMs were already en-route.

US and NATO pilots tend to have an average of 200 flight hours per year, while Russian pilots only get somewhere between 60-100. The US and NATO pilots use that extra flight time to train on stuff like SEAD.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week. That is simply not enough to compete with NATO's level of training and barely enough to keep their pilots proficient. NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova. Even as their ground force advanced they would get pinched off and isolated by the time they got anywhere near Germany. If I were a Russian I would be much more concerned about NATO at my doorstep than I would be Russia if I still lived in Germany.",1647337373.0,2

Their jets are not flying with the targeting pods required for SEAD missions, supposedly because they don't have enough of them. And they have a huge shortage in guided munitions, defaulting to ineffective dumb bombs. And they haven't really been using their anti-radiation missiles much. Their operations in Syria mostly relied on unguided munitions. A lot of us assumed that it was just Russia not giving a shit. But looking at Ukraine it becomes obvious that when fighting someone with the right equipment, guided munitions is the difference between a successful strike from a jet at high altitude and missing your target with unguided bombs dropped from a low altitude, exposing you to both enemy fighters and MANPADs.

It's showing us that Russia has never really changed from the Soviet era. Most of their power comes from propaganda. They had the world convinced that Russia had near peer capabilities and tech. In reality their most recent hardware/tech is completely absent in a disastrous war that they're losing. And their military tactics echo early Cold War era tactics and are completely useless against today's technology. It's the equivalent of leading an infantry charge into trenches full of machine guns.

As for why they haven’t equipped drones with HARMs, I’m not actually sure — Israel, India, and Turkey use the IAI Harop/Harpy 2 which is a loitering SEAD platform, so it stands to reason it’s well within US capabilities.

Russia tends to use much cheaper fixed radar arrays because they are cheaper for the effect. However, the USA uses directional radar arrays. These can be steered so that you can search for targets at all times or halted to focus on one key area. They are more expensive but also better as a result.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.

So, essentially as it moves away from the center of gravity (in this instance, think of it as the center of the star although it's a little bit off), it arcs quite slowly, but as it approaches the star it whips around.

Think of this orbit as kind of like a baseball field.  When you're going around the outfield, you're not turning that much in any one step, but as you come around home plate each step has a huge amount of arc in it.

If you draw a line through the middle of home plate, each side has 180 degrees. When you're near home plate, you can walk from one side around to the other in 2 or 3 steps. You've covered those 180 degrees in 2 or 3 seconds. 

Walking the same speed, it will take you what, 10 minutes? 20 minutes? to walk around down to third base, around the outfield, back down to first base, and back to home plate, completing the other 180 degrees and get back to where you started.

The end result of this is that for each degree of bend, when the object is in the outfield, it has many more steps to get across that degree, and so gravity out there, despite being weaker, has more time to act upon it.

Everything is affected by everything.

The thing is, we just take it that something 'escapes' an orbit, but the assumption there is that gravity affects it by such a small amount that it's negligible. And of course, other larger objects affect a far away body much more.

But let's say there is only an earth and a moon in the universe, and the moon is flying away from Earth in an orbit that it's escaping. Given enough time, the moon will come back to earth.",1647354426.0,1

With gravitational interactions there are 3 options, collision, escape, and orbit. If an object's speed is below the escape velocity at that distance then it will either collide with the larger body e.g. you on Earth's surface or it will orbit e.g planets/moons/satellites. Sedna is very far away so it must move relatively very slowly at that distance.

[Conversations with Brando](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/309025.Conversations_With_Brando) is a fun read if you're a fan, or just morbidly curious. I found it to be a pretty interesting look into his persona. Just a snippet:

 ""Bob Hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station in Anaheim, providing they have a camera there and three people. He'll go to the opening of a market to receive an award. He'd get an award from Thom McCan for wearing their shoes. It's pathetic. It's a bottomless pit. A barrel that has no floor. He must be a man who has an ever-crumbling estimation of himself. He's constantly filling himself up. He's like a junkie – an applause junkie. What happens to those people when they can't get up and do their shtick, God only knows. Bob Hope, Christ, instead of growing old gracefully or doing something with his money, be helpful, all he does is he has an anniversary with the President looking on. It's sad. He gets on an airplane every two minutes always going someplace. It didn't bother him at all to work the Vietnam War. Oh, he took that in his stride. He did his World War II and Korean War act. ""Our boys"" and all that. He’s a pathetic guy.“",1647306298.0,8

Worked for AOL for a brief time in the late '90s (it was terrible, the company had no ethics at all, but that's not the story here).

Accounts would get TOS violations, and sent to CAT (the Community Action Team) for a strike or block, which was either education, if it was a first or infrequent issue, up to account termination if it was egregious or frequent. 

However with celebrity accounts, even when they'd get a CAT strike or block, they wouldn't deal with CAT, but could still call the VIP team and get the block or strike removed, basically no questions asked.

The entire premise of what you are trying to say is completely incorrect. The rise of Boomer's also coincides with the rise of the counterculture and the backlash against conservative figures. Boomers are the reason why art from the mid 60s to early 70s is still held in such high regard, because things that were more risky and broke social conventions were particularly marketable and popular amongst young people. 

Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, John Wayne and so on are all figures that are really held up by the generation before. I know you said (when boomers were growing up) but Boomer culture hadn't come into it's own at this point and these figures weren't being marketed towards boomers, so they weren't for boomers.

I might point you towards the biggest figures amongst Boomers who were absolutely not fascist pricks and are still some of the most respected figures in all of art/society. Bob Dylan, McCartney, Lennon, Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Jim Morrison are really their most famous musicians and very much not fascists. Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood (yeah I know but he's a moderate Republican), Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep and so on are amongst the most popular actors amongst Boomers, and very much not fascist. The big sporting figures, Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Willie Mays, Bill Russell, very much not fascists. 

I'm Gen Z, but the point you are trying to say is literally the opposite of reality. These actors weren't most popular with boomers, and there is a line in history (somewhere between 63-65) where Western media diverges from the more traditional conservative sort of things and pushes in the opposite direction to attract boomers, and it's very obvious looking at the changes in fashion, music, the way people talked, spiritual and political beliefs and that sort of thing. It's fucken stupid how boomers get characterised as a conservative generation when their youth was far more extreme than the youth of today. Mainstream music, film and magazines are a lot more mainstream and less experimental, fashion is a lot plainer and more conservative in some ways and celebrities now are a lot, lot more commercial and conservative than the ones that the boomers idolised.",1647331624.0,4

I went to Brando's house once with Anita's son to fix a ""Kiva lamp"",  it was just a fluorescent lamp, I replaced the ballast.   Mr. Brando was  a crackup.

But still, not great when you’re paying the bills and have dealt with so much shit already and then this guy you spent so much on *isnt even ready!*

Also, apparently on the set of *The Score*, Brando wouldn’t speak directly to Frank Oz, the director. Instead he would only refer to him as Miss Piggy. Which seems like an incredibly shitty thing to do, but also pretty hilarious!",1647307870.0,4
