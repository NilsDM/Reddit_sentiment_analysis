303,funny,Dolphin trolls a seagull!,Ltcommander83,1647353576.0,508,27467,0.97,"The two instances of dolphin intelligence that stuck with me the most:

1) [The Dolphin fishermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwWfYLKFw0) in Brazil. Basically *the dolphins* figured out they can catch more fish if they work with us, so they purposefully chase schools of fish into our nets. This plan was concocted by the dolphins, ***NOT*** by the local fishermen, and the dolphins call the shots for all the fishing jobs. They signal, they choose where to fish, they choose when to fish, they're clearly in charge and the brains of the operation. All we did was recognize the value and play along.

2) Wish I had kept the vid of this but didn't wanna watch it again when I first found it: it was in Japan. A bunch of fishermen cornered a dolphin in a cove (is that the right word? Rock formation along the coast where you could block off one part and trap anything in the water) and it being Japan, of course the goal was to catch it and eat it. The dolphin was distressed and trying to escape, but couldn't. The dolphin's last ditch escape attempt...? It lept out of the water and onto the rocks, leaping towards one white, blonde tourist duo in a group of otherwise japanese fishermen. It was like the dolphin could recognize the dangerous ones and the *only* duo present that might help the dolphin, so the dolphin lept to them for help. That was....painful to watch. Whether the dolphin could recognize the difference due to the languages being spoken, the different physical features, the clothing or what have you...it doesn't matter. If they're smart enough to recognize such a difference and use that to make a logical conclusion, then we probably have no business killing and eating the damned things.",1647366909.0,1

So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide. In my experience, the access to readership that WebToon offers (specifically after you bust past that 1000 subscriber/40,000 monthly pageview threshold, before which WebToon does very little to help you get views) is well worth it.",1647362430.0,6

Yet Another Edit!:  Per advice in comments: If it has a ""tarry, sticky"" consistency and is black, get it checked out ASAP, this is a more telltale sign of internal bleeding than the black coloration alone.

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting - this is not unlike when you get a Check Engine light over something that‚Äôs not related to the engine 

It is called ‚ÄúReferred Pain.‚Äù  It goes against everything we understand about how pain signals work.  This is also why your left arm can hurt during a heart attack, but not many people are aware that other organs are innervated by the same exact nerve",1647349236.0,51

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back *(Edit: pushed back mostly using my legs, as I was in a crouched position)* and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind‚Äôs rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, ‚ÄúWell, now you‚Äôre just like the rest of us,‚Äù meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

Couple of MRIs, exams and tests later, and the neurologist told me the ER doctor is an idiot and that I just had a complex migraine. I spent weeks thinking I might get another stroke at any moment. Many months later, and I still get anxious if I stutter, or go into a room and forget why I went into it.

EDIT: There are a lot of replies about the ER doctor being called an idiot, so let me clarify. Firstly, the Neurologist called him an idiot, not me. I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests. He was named an idiot, again by the Neurologist, for causing undue psychological harm when there was clear evidence of an alternate explanation.",1647334811.0,698

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

IF coffee ground emesis is blood (often there is none), the blood may have been sitting in the stomach longer. Red blood speaks to the briskness of the bleeding. The same holds at the other end. Pooping black usually means blood from the stomach, but a brisk upper GI bleed can put out red blood per rectum. 

One thing to know about medicine, the typical presentation is not always the most likely. But the laws of physics still apply. Black stool can be from the colon, sure. But you‚Äôd never throw up blood from the colon. 

Getting a good history and exam on your patient, assessing the vitals, and triaging are key. Labs are helpful but the change in blood count lags far behind blood loss.

About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Didn‚Äôt need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn‚Äôt focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn‚Äôt remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I‚Äôve described seek medical attention.

It‚Äôs been two years almost now since that event and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight.

They're especially great for less mobile people like the elderly, disabled, pregnant people, small kids dragged on a long walk by their parents, etc. They encourage and facilitate use of the outdoors by everyone and thus promote public health.

All this by basically sticking 2 plancks into the ground.

My work had to create a plan where the building would go on lockdown should he show up as he was threatening that too. The final straw was when my brother left his phone out and my ex was non-stop calling it.... I picked up and lost my absolute shit.
 I found a place to rent, told nobody (not even family as my dad thought I was being dramatic and should forgive my because he's a good guy on paper; yeah that man can be another post), and somehow made out all right but drank a bit in this time. My mom sent me a picture one day of my dog in her house, I hauled ass to her house. She will never admit to it but I think she paid him money so I could have her as she was important to me.

Then she got her friend (yes the same one) to hook up with my buddy, who then convinced him to invite her to a party at his house I went to. I went into the bathroom and when I opened the door she was standing there. Freaked me the fuck out. I said ‚Äúhi, excuse me, I‚Äôm about to leave this house‚Äù when she pushed me as hard as she could back into the bathroom and came in and locked the door. At this point I freaked out and just started yelling for help. My buddy and a few others came and unlocked the door and pulled her out and I was able to get out of the bathroom. I started walking upstairs to head to the door and get in my truck to leave, when she flies out the door, and runs to my truck. She stands there while I am standing there in disbelief. At this point we had been broken up for months. I walk back inside and one of her friends approached me and told me if I told her, the friend, that I never wanted to see or talk to my ex again she would let me leave. I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving. 
This all happened after she did the following.
1) called me hundreds of times from a dozen numbers to which I blocked and requested she doesn‚Äôt call
2) egged new girlfriends car
3) tried to get me to do threesome
4) tried to make me fuck buddies
5) asked a very desperate friend of mine to prom hoping to get in our group
6) followed me to work, home

Two years later, I have a new phone number and am I‚Äôm college. I get a call and answer it. It‚Äôs her. No idea how she found me. She asked if I went to the local university to which I replied yes. I did not actually go there, I went to a state college. She enrolled in that university. 

That‚Äôs the end of that story

Update: thanks for the concern, this was 19 years ago and I‚Äôm safe. I only heard from her 1 more time and that was 15 years ago. Hoping that‚Äôs the end of it.

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off ‚Äújust over a block‚Äù from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I‚Äôd been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I‚Äôd been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

Back in 2019 I was going through a nasty divorce and she invited me to come live with her (with my 14 year old daughter) until the divorce was finalized (ex was unstable at this point).

On top of that, she was in the process of being evicted and she wanted me to give her $8k to lease a new home‚Ä¶in addition to spending every waking moment cleaning up her hoard. Her two daughters (21 and 19) were still living at home and they began telling me the rest of the story‚Ä¶how she had mountains of debt, how she planned to fleece me to get a new place to live‚Ä¶what‚Äôs worse was what they told me about what they had been through.

I had took her home to meet the family and even attend a wedding together. After that, we decided we should move in together. So I left my apartment. I loved that apartment. I moved on November 24th. Things weren't working out. She wanted to fight all the time, and I found out the secret extra room she had was to practice her hoarding. Busy season at work started and we got into many fights.

The best one was when she called my older sister at 2 in the morning trying to ""tell on me"" what I did and that I was ""acting crazy and mad"" and my sister said ""What did you do to my brother? I know my brother and he doesn't get mad unless somebody's constantly fucking with him to stir him up.""

I made plans to move in with a platonic girl friend of mind to get me out of there and help her out with the rent until I busy season was over and I could do the whole apartment search thing properly. I was doing 14+hour days through all of this. I said ""this isn't working so Imma leave and I'm breaking up with you and Ill be gone by the end of today.""

MY phone started acting funny so I took it to t-mobile to get a new chip. That is when I found out she had been snooping my phone the whole time.

While I was at mobile

1. she called the girl I was going to move in with (just a friend) and threatened her and said all kinds of crazy shit.  Now my friend said I couldn't move in with her because she didn't want that crazy bitch around.
2. She called her friends and family and told them some story - probably of me abusing her, and they rushed over and hid in the house and packed my stuff and got prepared to ambush me.
3. I parked outside and I just wouldn't go in. My sixth sense wouldn't let me go in after her. I called my friend and asked for moving help.
4. MY friend showed up, we opened the garage and started grabbing my couch.

Just then the cops showed up, they had been called on ""domestic violence""

If my buddy and I weren't both holding each end of the same couch and looking totally confused, we would have went to jail.

Then her and her family sprung out of the house and started making all these allegations and veiled threats and I just said ""I'm leaving""

She ran over to me and started fake crying and saying ""we can work this out""

I was like ""no thanks"" and I thanked the officers for being there to protect me from whatever those people were planning.

The cop said It was the calmest domestic violence he had ever seen.

I wasn't home, but she convinced the landlord (who knew us) to let her in. I had told the propery management specifically to NOT let her in. Anyway, I came home and my house was completely empty outside of my dog and an empty fish tank. I'm not exaggerating the empty. She took everything that wasn't nailed down. Food from the fridge, cupboards, pantry, etc. She took the SHOWER CURTAINs. We had two irons, she took both of them. Took my furniture, TVs, game systems plus games. This bitch even took the light bulbs out of the light fixtures. And not just the easy to access ones. The ones that are above those apartment panels everyone knows about.

I called the police and told them I had been robbed. When they got there the landlord said he let her in. Her name is not on the lease. They told me it was a civil matter and they couldn't do anything about it. I was obviously upset and being loud. My ex-army buddy was with me. The cops threatened to bash my head into the wall, called me a mutt (I'm mixed) and then left.

Editing because this comment kinda blew up:

We tried going after the property management. Unfortunately, their excuse was there was nothing in writing and the property management ""didn't recall"" me telling them not to let her in. She had already established domicile unfortunately, so she has the same ""rights"" that I do as a tenant. I would have had to evict her or prove that she somehow posed a threat to my life.

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

Elden ring reminds me so much the classics like Donkey Kong or Mario from the SNES era. A simple story with different biomes and unique enemies and bosses.

But sadly I fear that companies will look at the formula and miss interpret everything.

Like the lack of a quest track, or how devoided of orientation the game is to make navigating the world and finding things as rewarding as possible. I fear this will be subverted to thinking that games with bad uis should be the norm, or that lack of content = having to explore to find quests.

To me what makes ER great is how nothing is given to you for free. And you can play the game and miss a lot of amazing stuff, but the devs don't put an arrow trying to direct players to that amazing piece if content they threw in hundreds of hours creating. Instead if you find it then it just makes it even more amazing that you actually found that amazing moment or item.

I feel like ER invoque a sense of high punishment but also high reward in the sense that you need to try to get the best out of the game, and if you chose to not devote yourself to it, then it won't give everything back at you. It gives in equal proportion to what you are willing to invest I exploration, time and paying attention to what the devs created.

I might be a bit enamored with the game right now, but I honestly feel like few games have the guts to throw a player into a gigantic world full of content but hide the best away and force you to work for it.

That sense of awe and discovery is still pervasive, even over 100hrs in. And I have no signs of slowing down or fatigue.. I actually want to explore more. No other game has given me quite this same freedom or feeling. Witcher 3 was the closest example I can think of, but I think the entire map would fit in Limgrave? lol.

If you mean recycle boss fights of dungeons did feel repetitive but I liked exploring more the dungeons than just the boss fight, also like the payout of runes of the enemies in the dungeon plus boss fight.",1647365774.0,-1

Without spoiling anything for others who don't have as much progress, there is a huge problem with quest lines in the game. One quest line gets locked if you complete an optional dungeon too early.  Too early doesn't mean you do some speed run skips or warps, it literally is just arbitrary. You can progress and most people who don't look at guides will just follow the path thats open to them and accidentally lock themselves out of it. 

Did I also mention this questline has a bunch of items(weapons and armor) locked behind it? It does and it frustrates me that you can lock yourself out of it. I'm fine with this style of thing if it was a choice(x or y questline for dungeon), but you can literally do everything if you hold off on x until y is done. Its not a choice, its bad design. 

Not to mention, some npcs early in the quest tell you that the quest isn't morally good. Most people might shrug that off since its a Soulsborne, but new players might think ""Hey, I should do this quest line after the other one since it might have permanent negative effects"". It doesn't.

I get that you don't need every item to have fun in the game, but that should be up to player choice, not player knowledge. FF12 had a more extreme version, if you opened any of a certain amount of fake chests, you literally couldn't get the best spear in the game. These chests were randomly dispersed throughout the game and the game didn't telegraph and say ""Hey if you open certain chests, you might not be able to get x item"". This isn't nearly as bad as that, but it shares the same element of frustration due to a player not googling everything. I'm lucky I became obsessed with the game early in my playtime and came by this fact. Otherwise, I might have locked myself out.

So whats the solution? Either don't make the questlines you are locked out of lock you out of items(for example, you could have an alternative way of obtaining the items), make it a clearly telegraphed choice, or make the questline not dependent on arbitrary completion. You can easily make another npc offer a similar questline if for some reason the choice makes the original quest giver angry at you.

For anyone early on that might be deterred from playing blind by this, maybe I can give a bit of info to help. If you are doing an optional dungeon(or at least one that you aren't sure of), make sure you complete any quests you want before the final boss of that dungeon.",1647369538.0,1

1. Balance. It's pretty poor thanks to the open world both in upgrading and natural progression.
2. The final third. It's absurdly difficult in bad ways, not ""fair"" ways.
3. Reused assets. Much like all open world games, if you need to reuse that many assets, shorten the game instead of doing the opposite and padding it.
4. Boss design. The movements themselves and the difficulty feel worse than before. My #1 complaint is the lack of ability to punish, mostly with the main story bosses. I think BB, DS3, and Sekiro blow ER out of the water with boss design. There's zero flow and some of the actual choices are baffling. Shit like Radahn and Malenia don't even seem to have been playtested. Then add shit like how about midway through the game, the game gets lazy as fuck and just starts spamming gank fights with previous used enemies.
5. The open world. It's empty. I'm kinda baffled people are claiming it's dense. It has no more weapons or enemy variety than something like DS3 which is obvious much less smaller. Exploration isn't really worth it if you like your current weapons and/or ashes. Like I don't miss collecting BS collectibles just for  shit achievement, but the world is quite barren. It doesn't feel lived in at all.
6. Side content. I know this is FromSoft's thing but if you're gonna have a 100+ hour game, you need something other than combat. There's nothing other than combat.  Other open worlds like Witcher, Horizon, Oblivion, etc. don't add random content like side mission, parkour challenges, mini games, puzzles, etc. because they're padding the game. They know that if you're gonna spend a long time on something, it's nice to break the flow. That doesn't exist in ER. The exclusive thing to break flow is exploration, exploration that leads to more combat.
7. Side missions. Keeping the same side quest style as Souls/BB/Sekiro is just dumb. You can't be as obtuse when you're switching from 20/30 hours to 100. They don't even have a log.",1647369020.0,2

Yea the final part has been hard but I also had low vigor so I just invested in Health and I was good to go there's plenty of ways to get tons of runes for leveling. Compared to many other open world games I've played this game doesn't reuse nearly as much. Sure it's less exciting when you fight the same enemy or boss again but one the reused bosses are pretty much all optional meaning your expectations aren't as high and two there's so much unique locations and enemies that the reused stuff isnt as bad. I can't think of another open world game with this much distinct visual variety and enemy variety. That boss point is super subjective and for me and many others it's just learning attacks or using the right tools no boss has really seemed unfair just some take longer to learn than others. I don't understand how you think the world is enemy there's so much stuff all over the place and the lack of objective markers makes it better to explore it isn't that stupid checklist style of open world. If you're not willing to experiment and try new load outs than it's your fault the rewards are boring for you. Respecing is easier than ever and you can't blame the game when you're refusing to change how you play and try something new.  It's a souls game and you're surprised it has souls gameplay im for one glad they don't just add a bunch of open world bs and stick with what they do best and do that one thing well. Yea there's no quest log and it's a bit annoying but the side quests I do solve on my own are super satisfying.

Wich means, that as game developpement progress and as resolution increase, we could maybe see more and more scopes realistically rendered in fps.

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

Moreover I also have a technical question for the devs out there : if you decide to render a second scene for the scope, does it typically don't add any load on the gpu, since it also stops rendering a similar area on the ""main"" image ?",1647347952.0,4

It‚Äôs from a smaller studio so it doesn‚Äôt have the graphical polish or menu crispness of a COD.  But, it‚Äôs one level more realistic than COD and Battlefield, and I‚Äôm in love.  

It‚Äôs a little slower, one or two bullets kill, no future sci fi gadgets, can‚Äôt shoot whilst going prone or jumping (get the COD babies outta here! Lol), etc. It‚Äôs all about strategy and long term communication.  

I‚Äôm not going to sit here and pretend that every game is full of team communicators.  But, everything in this regard is better than COD.  If you create what you want - communication, teamwork, call outs - you‚Äôll get it here in return more than any other FPS I‚Äôve played.

Edit: referring to Insurgency Sandstorm, the game in the original post.  I play on PS5 and from the games subs I hear the player base is a little better here than on PC.  Maybe because it‚Äôs only six months old here.

the ""warzone"" files are just the mw19 files. basically, there is no space for you to save, so dont feel bad.

mw19 came first. they built warzone as a mode that could also be downloaded. because of that, warzone requires the full files of mw. but that's just it, they're the same thing.

whereas campaign & spec ops? you can uninstall those all day. but warzone is just a game mode basically, if you didnt want the warzone files...you wouldnt have the mp files, then!

so you arent missing out on space, mw is just THIQQ.

You see examples of these principles being used across mediums (movies, tv, photography, graphic design, etc.) so why everyone in this thread is having such a hard time believing experienced video game designers would be employing them too is baffling to me.  


Sure, there is more that goes into level design than just this, that's not what OP was saying.

Ignoring that I flat out just don‚Äôt think a lot of this is true (green arrows really feel like a stretch).

If it were, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good design for the average gamer due to what you SHOULD be doing.

Going to the castle right away, for most gamers new to this series, is an absolute death wish. While I agree the castle should be the ultimate first major goal, it‚Äôs way too close to where you start.

Better design would have been placing your spawn in an area where your only choice was to do a lot of exploring before you hit the castle and with nothing really behind you.

It‚Äôs really weird that there is an entire island behind you with arguably easier enemies and dungeons that‚Äôs really out of the way compared to the one you start in.

Not that it‚Äôs a bad game (love it and most enjoyable platinum I‚Äôve gotten in awhile) but I think people go into this as Souls fans and veterans.

But, let‚Äôs say a player follows the gold pixie dust aka ‚Äúthe main quest‚Äù right. And they follow it religiously.

That ‚Äúfunnels‚Äù you north to the Church of Elleh, then then cliffs ease you into the Gatefront Ruins, up the valley to the Stormhill Shack all leading you to, and then through, Stormveil Castle right?

Ok, so say you manage to plug away and beat Stormveil without thinking, ‚Äúfuck it this is hard, I‚Äôm going to explore‚Äù. Then you‚Äôd beat Godrick and then it‚Äôd organically funnel you through the back into Liurnia. Not Limgrave East or the Weeping Peninsula, and definitely not Caelid.

But eventually, you‚Äôll hit a roadblock at the Grand Lift of Dectus. Essentially a ‚Äúzone portal‚Äù that‚Äôs inaccessible until you‚Äôve retrieved the 2 halves of this token that activates the Grand Lift.

Now this is where it gets brilliant. Those 2 halves are located in Limgrave East, and Caelid.

So the game will ‚Äúflow‚Äù you to explore most of the southern expanse of the map.

But, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre an explorationist like me. Well then you might go and explore and earn the two halves of the medallion far before ever reaching the Grand Lift itself. 

So an example of what makes this game great, is how, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for exploring. Some games might make you double back to the spots to get the medallion pieces, because until you‚Äôve interacted with the Grand Lift (to use this Elden Ring as a wider example); those medallion pieces aren‚Äôt attainable.

Now of course that‚Äôs really poor design, but yeah, just to highlight another ‚Äúflow‚Äù pattern this game has in the first half-ish of the game",1647369956.0,1

You summed things up well at the bottom of your post but for some reason feel the need to be nitpicky.
 
Its not literally every line and only those lines:
this would look silly and artificial, of course there are some lines not aligned with the focus of attention its supposed to look like an open organic world.   But if you were to draw an arrow over every single visual element the length and numbers of the lines radiating from/to the church would noticeably stand out.  

There also doesn't need to be an actual arrow type end indicating direction : if the majority of lines focus on a single point it naturally draws attention there. the other end of the lines have no focus because they go every other direction and don't add to anything


Besides even your examples of the ruins and bridge and towers do actually support drawing focus to the church. they create a horizontal cut off to frame the church between the bridge/castle line and matching line of the stone floor at the bottom of the image.  

They aren't leading lines for the church but they are for the ""where you're going"" part of the image - a secondary focus. 

And while the player doesn't know or need to know the story purpose of each visual element - its not over analyzing to point out this was likely a deliberate design choice to feature them all in one view.   

 Also a giant glowing tree is definitely not ""just a skybox""  every new player I've seen looks at it and goes ""whoa"".",1647369383.0,1

So many games do this when you exit a tutorial or when you discover a new area. It's just good game design.  
Fallout 3 for example. Exit the vault and you are presented with 3 options and an attention grabber.  
A sign points out a place called ""megaton"" exists and is nearby.  
The road to the left looks inviting and has immediate likely loot locations,  in this direction lies the main quest. The road right goes over a hill that is closer to you then the loot locations to the left. The unbeaten path beckons. This path leads to immediate adventure and random encounters.

The NPC literally says to go down for a tutorial before going through the doors. There is even an item up on a ledge implying there is a way to possibly get to it if you go down.

That being said Elden Ring has a lot more deliberate design put into its world structure to guide players. Even the locations of the map fragments for each area and what parts of the map they uncover are meant to guide you towards a certain path (i.e. the very first map fragment when you enter the lake in Liurnia reveals the eastern coast of the lake, not the lake center itself, and not the west coast, that's very intentional). They put the guidance of grace markers for people who have gotten off the main story path to make it easier to figure out where to go next.

in ER there isn't necessarily a ""wrong"" way to go but there is definitely a loose path clearly intended by From. It's evident by things like map fragment locations, NPC locations and the progression through their quests (Hyetta is a big one that people say is hard to find, yet if you follow the way the map reveals you find her at every one of her locations really easily), item placement in different locations that look inaccessible, placing obvious easy to spot enemies like jellyfish around hidden entrances, large markers that stand out on the horizon from vantage points, as well as simple enemy scaling (you just got teleported to the crystal tunnels in caelid, you can't kill shit and get instantly wiped, maybe this is an area for later, just like the skeletons in DS1).

‚ÄúTenga‚Äù is the wrong form of ‚Äútener‚Äù to use in this case. Guy in the video said it twice, knew it didn‚Äôt sound right, and corrected himself the third time.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying ‚Äútengas‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you‚Äôre misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. ‚Äú¬øNo tengas?‚Äù is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are ‚Äúno tengas miedo‚Äù (don‚Äôt be afraid), ‚Äúespero que tengas dinero‚Äù (I expect that you‚Äôll have money), and ‚Äúojal√° que tengas mam√°‚Äù (I hope you have a mom).

4679,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,865,57950,0.96,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mam√°"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mam√°?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -„Äã ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mam√°) es triste"" -„Äã ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mam√°"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,3

""Where is mom?""
When he should've asked:
>""¬øD√≥nde est√° tu mam√°?""

""Where is your mom?""

Then he says:
>""¬øD√≥nde tu mam√°?""

""Where your mom?"", missing the verb 'est√°' (is)

Finally, as others have pointed out:
>""¬øNo tengas?""

You don't have? (present subjunctive)

Should be, and he corrects himself:
> ""¬øNo tienes?""

""You don't have [a mom]?"" (present indicative)

Finally, the tone and cadence with which he says:
>""Lo siento pobrecito""

Makes it sound like he's nicknamed this little one 'Poorfella' instead of the exclamation he seems to want to express, ""I'm sorry. Poor little guy.""

But then he says ""Donde Tu Mama"" which should be ""Donde esta Tu Mama"", the way he said it would sound like ""Where you Mom"" in english. Thirdly the way he pronounces Mama is clearly his english accent as there would be a different inflection on both syllables in Spanish. Then he seems to struggle at the end when he says ""No Tiengas... No Tengas... No Tienes?"" He's mixing up the conjugation on the verb 'tener' which is to Have. ""No Tienes"" is not technically wrong but He should  have said ""No Tenes?"" In this instance due to familiarity with the Deer.",1647361757.0,1

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too.

It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyonc√© with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded.

So that's ignoring MTV, tv appearances, radio, advertisements everywhere... The funny thing is, it was easier in some ways to have mega popular stuff. Even with the internet, it wasn't like today until everyone had smart phones. Hit tv shows were watched weekly and people had that to talk about, whereas now because of streaming, one person may be watching MASH, another Friends, and someone else just binged Breaking Bad. What's there to talk about between those? Few shows today get weekly followers like they used to, especially kids shows. 

But anyways back to the point - every other song on the radio was either Michael Jackson or Madonna at the time. You'd have a lot of stuff mixed in, from Billy Idol to Journey, but then always back to MJ and Madonna. For years.

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn‚Äôt listen or watch the video because of ‚Äúsatan‚Äù. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church ‚Äúdances‚Äô.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20‚Äôs at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that‚Äôs come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn‚Äôt miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ‚Äôs life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That‚Äôs fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you‚Äôll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince‚Äôs unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It‚Äôs like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn‚Äôt exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don‚Äôt really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

The technical internet as we know it may have started in 1983, but it was nothing like it was between 1994 - 1996. BBS dialup was NOT readily accessible to most people outside of a rare few entitled and wealthy kids who could not only afford the seemingly impossibly priced hardware and modems, but the M-----F---ing AT&T charges for a long distance call to said BBS systems. It was ALLL dialup, no one could afford a Digital Subscriber Line, and the load time for BBS was crazy. The invention of better, inexpensive IBM clone hardware combined with improved GUIs and browsers changed everything, and that was the mid-90s. I assure you no one was getting their music info from online but the top 1% of the 1%.

The bulk of cultural impact was measured in TV ratings, *pulp magazine sales,* newspapers sold, and radio airtime. Magazines played a much larger role in music and pop culture than at any previous point in history, because the news stand basically was the internet before the internet, which is why the magazine racks are a shell of their former selves and news print media is damn near extinct since the birth of the real internet in the mid-to-late 1990s.",1647361714.0,3

People got their music from the Radio, TV/ MTV (when they actually played music), or a Record/ Cassette that someone had purchased. That was basically it for the normal person.

Subsequently, the memorabilia, including the jockstrap, were **donated to the last operating Alaskan Blockbuster Video store in Anchorage**.[4][10] The jockstrap remained there in a glass case along with other items from the Crowe auction and became a local attraction.[10] However, the items failed to prevent the store from closing in July 2018.[11] Afterwards, the owners of the Alaska store **sent all their memorabilia to** the last remaining Blockbuster Video store in the United States, located in **Bend, Oregon**.[12] However, **Crowe's jockstrap was missing** from the items sent to this store, with Oliver claiming in September 2018 that he **did not know its location**.""

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

6386,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,710,17610,0.94,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

I visited a year ago and had a blast - it is one of 4 cities to have a volcano (extinct) within its city boundaries, and there's a cindercone butte in the middle of town that you can climb up for some decent views. On a clear day you can see Mt. Hood. There's also some lava tubes near town if you're into exploring caves - theyre quite linear so you dont have to fear getting lost. Just a bit south of town is the newberry volcano and Paulina lake; the lake is as normal a lake as any other, but if you dig a hole on the beach and let it fill with water, the volcanic activity below the ground heats it up to hot tub temperature (or hotter/cooler, there was some variation). People have dug their own hot tubs all along the beach side. And just a \~2 hour drive away from Bend is one of my favorite national parks - Crater Lake.

Trump claims to be 6'3"" and 239 lbs. This height is clearly exaggerated and the real number is closer to 6'0"" or 6'1"". The weight is also closer to 250 or 260 based on pictures. 

I don't think that Putin's knee can support Trumps fat ass. Things are going to fall apart, kinda like Russian logistics are.

Edit: [Source for Trumps clearly incorrect weight](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/16/doctor-says-trump-is-6-3-239-pounds-and-the-internet-has-so-many-athlete-comparisons/). I put my estimate for Trumps weight based on a BMI visualizer. I think the visualizer assumes little to no muscular definition. More muscle will make a person look thinner than they are so at 300 you may look the same as someone who is 260 if you lift weights.

I'm appalled at the effects of Russian money in our elections and political campaigns. Sadly, we can't call the police to do anything about it now, we don't have that option.

Did Deripaska use the normal process for removing a squatter?

> The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

> After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

> * leave your property within 24 hours  
> * stay away from your property for 12 months

> To get final possession of the property, you must make a claim for possession.

No, they broke the door open and arrested them for trespass. So, actually, I'm more appalled that Russian Oligarchs who are sanctioned get more favourable treatment than British home-owners, who have to get a court IPO to have squatters removed.

The report also states that Manafort was sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, though investigators couldn't determine why. The report outlines Kilimnik in contact with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, trying to resolve an issue involving Manafort owing a debt to Deripaska. The report goes on to state that the Russian oligarch wanted Manafort to advance Deripaska's interests in the event that Trump won the election. It should also be noted that following the election President Trump dropped sanctions on certain companies that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska's bottom line, though no direct link was established in the Mueller Report.**


*Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[1]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)*


>The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort **[redacted]** did not see a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

>...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, **[redacted].** Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 

>Gate's account about polling data is consistent **[redacted]** with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, **[redacted].**

>The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:

>> *I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.*

>> *Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]*

>Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.

**Furthermore, after being elected the Trump administration removed sanctions from Russian entities that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)**

>The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.

>...The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from¬†stray dog rescue¬†to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.

>The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal‚Äôs biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.

>And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.

>In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them ‚Äî in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.

>Notably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.

>...The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.

>Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.

>...Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.

>‚ÄúScore that a win for Putin,‚Äù¬†tweeted¬†Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.

You can only apply for an IPO if it‚Äôs been 28 days or less since you found out your property‚Äôs been squatted.

>Fill in an application for an IPO and send it to your local county court.

>The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

>After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

>leave your property within 24 hours
stay away from your property for 12 months

Except does that make any sense at all? Why on earth would Ukraine **want** to draw Belarus into attacking them? Ukraine isn't on the offensive here, they're fighting a purely defensive war, the **last** thing they want is to draw in a new attacker while also jeopardizing their global good will by committing an act of aggression. If they HAD long range missile capable of an attack like that, what possible reason would Ukraine have for launching them at Belarus, and not Russia, or the occupying Russian forces?

It does, however, make sense for *Russia* to have secretly fired that missile, especially if done from Ukrainian territory. Then, they can say they that not only are they such good allies of Belarus for helping stop this one missile, but that obviously Ukraine is a threat and they must join forces to stop them.

It's a classic False Flag attack, one of many we're likely to see from Russia as their position gets more and more tenuous.

> The Ukrainian air defence system shot down a missile fired from the territory of Belarus in Kyiv.

 >Human mortality from H5N1 or the human fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 refer to the ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern due to the global spread of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia.

While I do think there are some animated movies that don't need a remaster (mainly most Disney movies from the golden era) I do think some deserve that treatment. Shrek is one of them. Even if you look at Shrek 2, it looks way better than the first.

Some classics were dealt rough hands, As you mentioned Toy Story, When the 3rd movie came out and it ""ended"" I thought it would be great if they remastered the 1st in the style of the 3rd. 

We've seen it in games, a remaster of an old classic with a modern update. Some movies deserve that treatment.

Everyone here is writing other factors that may contribute to depression. But COVID-triggered depression is weird or, better stated, different on it own. I have had depression from external and internal factors, and fighting to not go any further with my new covid-triggered depression. The big difference between both is that, and this is anecdotal, the first one, it‚Äôs kinda just degenerating state over time that you can back track from traumatic events, but covid-triggered is way different it is like you are one person and then just like that you are grey (to me it took just about 1 week to descend into a depressed state) it just happens. 

I had a not severe, mostly asymptomatic case. But one of my doctor‚Äôs colleagues committed suicide after a two week severe case, recovering and months of treatment for depression (at the moment diagnosed as PTSD). It is very difficult to relate covid with depression because there are many contributing factors, but I think there is a difference between PTSD after this whole mess and Covid-triggered depression.",1647368876.0,1

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.  

ICU delirium significantly contributes to injuries in the hospital setting and increased length of hospitalization and can result in PTSD, depression, and personality and/or memory changes that persist after the hospitalization is over and delirium has resolved.",1647360852.0,25

Say what you will about some of the terminology used in this description of the ""pain body"" which really resonates with me, but in my experience, this has been useful.

A tl;dr version could be: hurt people hurt people (including themselves)

Or: misery loves company.

""
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, ‚Äúbecome you,‚Äù and live through you. It needs to get its ‚Äúfood‚Äù through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. 

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn‚Äôt really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane. 

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don‚Äôt face it, if you don‚Äôt bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn‚Äôt make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth ‚Äî that is, make it real in your own experience. 

So the pain-body doesn‚Äôt want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength.""",1647367015.0,2

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,10

I can't find the link (lots of other stuff comes up) but researchers did MRIs during sex and found that the penis doesn't go in a vagina and stay straight, it bends about 60-90 degrees (upward in missionary).  That's why bendy dildos sell better, and why rigid-object insertion can be so dangerous to a vag.

I never watched romcoms as a young teen because I didn‚Äôt like the plots. Now as an adult, I understand why I didn‚Äôt like the plots. 

Raunchy comedy has the same issue. Superbad literally pioneered consent in film. I remember Comedy Central playing a comedy where a man was raped while sleeping by a woman and his girlfriend walks in, and assumes he‚Äôs cheating on her. He was literally blacked out drunk and was raped on screen and this was ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù. No wonder so many millennial men hate women and can‚Äôt figure out how to date them, when their formative teenage years was filled with this trash or anime. Neither of which are particularly great at displaying that women are humans.

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape. I can‚Äôt help but wonder why this is even an option when someone reports sexual assault, in the same way I wonder why so many men think stalking is a way to win a woman back.

In an era in which action against collective entities was discouraged among the general populace (e.g. a few hundred years ago), but action against individuals was encouraged (e.g. physical fights and duelings seen as legal), this might reverse.

Heck, it might even reverse in the USA less then 100 years ago when lynchings were de facto legal and unionization efforts scorned as communistic or otherwise un-American.

A good point brought up below was social media, which could be a societal reversion to a more balanced ability to act against both collective entities and individuals. OTOH social media also makes it easier for others to act against you, which might create a counter-balance away from individual enmity, as being hostile to an individual psychologically increases the thought that people will be hostile towards you.

‚ÄúThe future of man is surrounded with perplexing question marks and tragic conflicts. The process of evolution and natural selection may not allow for harmonization. Man may be at the crossroads. He may be forced to live and survive in two different environments: one, the natural environment in which his freedom as a biological being, the function of the creator, is the most supreme criterion; and the other, a technological automatic, or better said, a conserved and conserving environment in which his freedom and his creative function are restrained and forced to flow between the bedrock of mechanical evolution. Races of men fit for the one may be unfit for the other. The criteria of unfitness are different in both environments. One line of evolution may lead inescapably to societies of men similar to societies of insects, harmonious and 100 percent efficient but unindividualistic. The other line of evolution may lead inescapably to a new race of men who tacitly will follow the direction of their ascendance up to date, modified and enhanced by the triumph over the robot (p. 345)‚Äù

 screens prior to its premiere. Fox was promoting the hell out of Brisco  
 County. 

 It's first Friday night was a 2-hour episode, the next Friday   
night, there was a ""UFO special"" on Fox after Brisco County, the third   
Friday night, Sept. 10, 1993, The X-Files started its run.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

  
 I used to work at a graphic arts company and our shift was 2p-10p m-f.    
Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick

Half the character's charm is that he scarcely ever gives a shit and is game for hijinks basically whenever, but a lead character has to be more invested than that.

Sam Axe has a constant ""I just wanna' go home"" energy whenever he's the focus of the plot, which is fantastic in short bursts, but wouldn't hold up to scrutiny in a spinoff where he's the perpetual focus. Character would have to change a lot to support it.",1647362283.0,7

The network also pushed for more interpersonal conflict and the cromags as a 'big bad guy'. They drove the professor out & replaced him with a playboy playmate.

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?

Also there was extensive RADAR jamming by US/coalition forces which lead to the famous video images of tracer fire lighting up the sky but not aimed at anything in particular in response by Iraq forces.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

The guy dodges all but one missile with flares and wild manouevres, basically like a nagging super fast mosquito and then out of view being hit (it looked like that) but not bad enough to take him down.

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular.

At least some of the torpedo bombers had air cover. The problem was that the technique the USN was using at the time sucked.  
Some examples:   
The Enterprises fighter squadron VF-6 was providing cover for Hornets torpedo squadron VT-8 (VF-6 had lost the group of planes it was intended to cover and had basically 'latched' onto VF-8 instead). The issue was that the USN plan was to fly ""high cover"", so the USN fighters were high and the bombers were low, and as a result the USN fighters didn't do much (anything?) to interfere with the Zeros.  
When Enterprises torpedo squadron came in while VF-6 was still in the air and still ineffective.  
Yorktown's strike actually came in together, with the fighters (VF-3), bombers (VB-3) and torpedo aircraft (VT-3) arriving together. They went in as a single strike but one of the ways Japan had of dealing with their CAP being drawn away was keeping 'ready' aircraft on the decks which could be launched to respond to new threats, so by the time they came in the USN fighters were massively overmatched in number (6 USN fighters vs 40+ IJN fighters). VT-3 was also screwed in that they ran headfirst into the fighters chasing down the departing survivors of VT-6. 
  
> The Devastators drew the carrier's Zero cover downwards and they didn't have time to regain altitude when the other bombers arrived.  
  
VT-6 was also the only squadron that really had any effect at drawing the cover downwards, as they actually went in with other attacks. The other torpedo attacks were so early that there was plenty of time for the Japanese CAP to return to altitude. The idea of VT-8 (or VT-6) bravely sacrificing themselves to draw the CAP down is a myth that was created to try and pin a purpose to the slaughter of the torpedo squadron.",1647360789.0,2

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week. That is simply not enough to compete with NATO's level of training and barely enough to keep their pilots proficient. NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

SFOD-A: A Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or ""A-Teams""). Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO, high altitude low opening), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.).

The movie [12 Strong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong) which is based on reporting by [Gary Schroen depicts their role either as forward observers, trainers, or other operational activities.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Schroen)

The CIA needed ODA teams on the ground to direct airstrikes. 12 strong illustrates roughly how that was done, including coordination with the CIA to bribe local warlords and removing MANPADS with large amounts of cash from Afghanistan.

SFOD-B: The ODB, or ""B-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11‚Äì13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field.

Note: Any time you read ""direct"", picture in your head shooting at the enemy. Direct fire = point and shoot. Indirect fire = artillery, mortars, fire from an unseen adversary.

SFOD-C: The SFODC, or ""C-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals, and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies.

SFOD-D: SFOD-D, or Delta Force is comprised of soldiers recruited from within the US Army's 75th Ranger's Regiment and the other occupational detachments. Strong focus on counter terrorism, clandestine operations. Generally works closely with the CIA's SAC/SOG.

Suffice it to say, Delta force are usually made up of former Green Berets. Functionally, due to the expected clandestine nature of their role they are separate but SFOD-A/B/C/D are all still under the command of JSOC and USSOCOM.

These can be steered so that you can search for targets at all times or halted to focus on one key area. They are more expensive but also better as a result.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this. It has a much better system for target indentification and radar so the plan is to feed information from it to other systems so that the F-35 does all of the guidance and the actual missile systems and aircraft never really show up to the enemy.",1647333355.0,17

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.  I was reading a few days back a thread of people who'd tracked cruise-missile launches by planespotting the rockets from cellphone cameras and CCTV back to the launch corridor within minutes.
