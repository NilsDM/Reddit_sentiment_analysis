296,funny,Dolphin trolls a seagull!,Ltcommander83,1647353576.0,714,42653,0.95,"The two instances of dolphin intelligence that stuck with me the most:

1) [The Dolphin fishermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwWfYLKFw0) in Brazil. Basically *the dolphins* figured out they can catch more fish if they work with us, so they purposefully chase schools of fish into our nets. This plan was concocted by the dolphins, ***NOT*** by the local fishermen, and the dolphins call the shots for all the fishing jobs. They signal, they choose where to fish, they choose when to fish, they're clearly in charge and the brains of the operation. All we did was recognize the value and play along.

2) Wish I had kept the vid of this but didn't wanna watch it again when I first found it: it was in Japan. A bunch of fishermen cornered a dolphin in a cove (is that the right word? Rock formation along the coast where you could block off one part and trap anything in the water) and it being Japan, of course the goal was to catch it and eat it. The dolphin was distressed and trying to escape, but couldn't. The dolphin's last ditch escape attempt...? It lept out of the water and onto the rocks, leaping towards one white, blonde tourist duo in a group of otherwise japanese fishermen. It was like the dolphin could recognize the dangerous ones and the *only* duo present that might help the dolphin, so the dolphin lept to them for help. That was....painful to watch. Whether the dolphin could recognize the difference due to the languages being spoken, the different physical features, the clothing or what have you...it doesn't matter. If they're smart enough to recognize such a difference and use that to make a logical conclusion, then we probably have no business killing and eating the damned things.",1647366909.0,1

So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide.

2) I like a freer market, generally-speaking, but obviously corporations can't always be trusted to act in the best interests of their societies. Sometimes they do, like various companies currently withdrawing business from Russia. And sometimes they're like Nestle and they do shady shit. There should be some regulations.

It was about how the American Medical Association put out a guide to ""inclusive language"" for doctors and other healthcare workers.

For example, it recommends avoiding the term ""vulnerable"" to describe a group at-risk for a disease and to instead use ""oppressed"" even though that makes no sense in many contexts.

And it advocated avoiding the term ""combat"" (as in ""combat disease"") because of ""violent connotations.""

The NYT article made the very good point that the language guide claims to advance ""equity"" yet makes no mention of universal healthcare, which the AMA opposes, or abortion rights.

So how interested in ""equity"" are they really?

It's often why churches in Black communities have an outsized influence--if you're raised in an environment where your family isn't there to support you, places like churches will. 

For example--say you have a job interview. But you need a ride? Can you get one? If you have social capital, it would be nothing for you to call up your parents or a nearby friend to make it work. But if your ""social capital"" is small or nonexistent--what are you going to do? There are alternatives, but they're often expensive and/or hard to arrange. 

It's also one of the ways in which the decline of things like churches, fraternal orders, etc, can have a negative impact, because the internet's not going to help in this sense. If all the friends you have live across the country, they can't help babysit your kid. It used to be if you needed advice--""Hey, anyone know a plumber?"" you could ask that after church and get a good recommendation. Today? Hope your plumber has a great SEO!

And this isn't a government thing.

I'm worried about the erosion of female identity by removing all references to ""women"" in women's spaces.

I think society needs to do a much better job of recognizing when each applies, and whether they should be either stated or assumed.

Okay, I went and read the argument against it, and the claims are that ""breastfeeding"" is a gendered term. But like, how? Men have breasts do we not? If we are lactating through them (I have no idea if this is possible or not with hormone therapy, it would be awesome if it is possible though!), are we not still breastfeeding then? I am thoroughly confused. 

Also, apparently breastmilk is a bad term now as well? Again, because its apparently gendered. Again, how is this the case? Men have breasts (I though I was going crazy so actually looked up whether they are medically called breasts for men, and men do in fact medically have breast tissue) so if they produce milk from them is it still not breast milk?

My friend who is a gym goer still does not compare to her 24/7 PC gamer skinny ass brother. Hell, I lost a stair climbing battle with my overweight ex-smoker father who is the most lazy man you could meet!

It‚Äôs upsetting that I see women who talk about how this doesn‚Äôt sit right with them, and people will say things like ‚Äúsounds like someone who lost to a trans person‚Äù. When Pistorius was going to run, they did many tests to make sure the legs designed for him to run didn‚Äôt give him an advantage against other runners. They test athletes for performance enhancement drugs and testosterone to make sure it‚Äôs all fair game. Ignoring the fact that certain biological things could give someone an advantage is just unfair to those that have no control over these things. The more it is ignored, the more traction TERFs have, and perhaps the more that other competitors will be pushed over to that side. 

Trans people of course have a space within sports! If it‚Äôs not competitive, there‚Äôs really no point in making this an issue.

Here's a prime example, and I can almost guarantee it will offend everyone at first glance: It's is factual that the happiest countries with the highest standards of living are the least ethnically diverse. 

What many, if not most, fail to appreciate about this statement is that it is not an observation that the enemy of prosperity is X or Y subset of individuals, but diversity of any kind. And rationally, this makes perfect sense, and is not taboo to admit. The less difference between the ideals of any two individuals in a group, the less turmoil. A collection of ideals can only be as prosperous as the greatest disparity between subset ideals will allow. 

What's important to note about all of this is that it's a morally agnostic fact. If I like chocolate ice cream, and you like vanilla, but we must agree to the ice cream we must consume every day, what's the ""morally correct"" answer? What about that guy over there who hates both and demands spumoni? And that other person whose lactose intolerant? The more facets to the disparities, the more difficult it becomes to manage a compromise, until a critical mass is reached where everyone is equally upset and unserved.

I'm downgrading this from ""Immediately Go to the Hospital"" to ""Check with your Doctor if This Shit Doesn't Stop.""  Sorry for anyone that I unintentionally scared.  That said, when it happened to me, it turned out to be quite serious.

Yet Another Edit!:  Per advice in comments: If it has a ""tarry, sticky"" consistency and is black, get it checked out ASAP, this is a more telltale sign of internal bleeding than the black coloration alone.  Also, if it accompanied by abdominal pain get it checked out ASAP as well.  In all other cases, it may still be worth it to call your doctor, describe the symptom, and tell them what you ate or drank.",1647322867.0,10107

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting. 

Basically, you don‚Äôt experience a heart attack every day, so your brain‚Äôs first interpretation of this event can be kinda wonky.  Think of it like when your check engine light comes on for something you know isn‚Äôt related to the engine 

It is called ‚ÄúReferred Pain.‚Äù  It goes against everything we understand about how pain signals work.  This is also why your left arm can hurt during a heart attack, but not many people are aware that other organs are innervated by the same exact nerve",1647349236.0,58

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back *(Edit: pushed back mostly using my legs, as I was in a crouched position)* and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

**TL;DR: Absolutely do not ever play with ""Live"" electric circuits if you can avoid it, and don't ever dismiss an electric shock as ""nothing"" just because it didn't kill you immediately.**",1647347156.0,30

1822,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,10547,26174,0.92,"""People go mad in idiosyncratic ways.

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind‚Äôs rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, ‚ÄúWell, now you‚Äôre just like the rest of us,‚Äù meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

IF coffee ground emesis is blood (often there is none), the blood may have been sitting in the stomach longer. Red blood speaks to the briskness of the bleeding. The same holds at the other end. Pooping black usually means blood from the stomach, but a brisk upper GI bleed can put out red blood per rectum. 

One thing to know about medicine, the typical presentation is not always the most likely. But the laws of physics still apply. Black stool can be from the colon, sure. But you‚Äôd never throw up blood from the colon. 

Getting a good history and exam on your patient, assessing the vitals, and triaging are key. Labs are helpful but the change in blood count lags far behind blood loss.

About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Didn‚Äôt need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn‚Äôt focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn‚Äôt remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I‚Äôve described seek medical attention.

It‚Äôs been two years almost now since that event and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight. I‚Äôm talking 80 pounds or so. I‚Äôve been through a few other medications and psychiatrists and think I‚Äôve finally found one who understands what the drug interaction did.

Brian started out as a straight-man for Peter‚Äôs hijinks. He‚Äôd just quietly observe, drink, and make off-hand common-sense observations.

Then he got flanderized (look it up), like most of the characters on the show. His general voice-of-reason attitude grew into being preachy and rude. And his vaguely left-leaning thoughts turned into this obnoxious parody of progressive Democrats. 

Point is, I think it‚Äôs wrong to suggest that move was as deliberate choice for the show-runners. It was a slow breakdown of the show and it‚Äôs characters, not a 4D chess move meant to secretly make fun of itself. All the characters went through similar arcs, as the writers noted what people responded to about them and just made those traits way larger over time.",1647365767.0,3

Many of the midgame bosses are super low level (bosses around morgott) relative to the level you‚Äôll be if you‚Äôve been actually playing the game and not just rushing the main story. The game encourages exploration and gives you a massive amount of souls, however the bosses are still given the amount of health they‚Äôd have in the progression of a normal souls game.

The game is built around exploring the world and every aspect of the game encourages exploration, however the bosses were not designed with this in mind‚Ä¶ somehow.

That said you should absolutely be in the triple digits, how you do malenia or maliketh or smth below level 100 is beyond me, and how you even get to that point below level 100 is also beyond me.

The difficulty works in these games because it's paired with two things: high lethality, and high player expression. 

Most bosses take less than 30 hits to kill, which is really quite few when you consider how fast players attack. Fights are decided quickly - it's pretty rare for a fight to be ""close"", usually either the player has mastered the boss and wipes the floor with them or the boss one shots the player at some point. The combat is lethal, enemies kill the player quickly but players can do the same to enemies. When the player one shots a mook with a backstab or burns down a tough enemy in a single R1 combo, it feels good - and when an enemy fakes you out and rips your health apart, you feel suitably humbled.

And on the other side, the player expression in the game is huge. A parrying dagger user is going to play different from someone powerstancing greatswords, will play massively different from an arcane spellcaster, will play different from a dodgeroll spamming quality build, etc. I've cut apart bosses people were stuck on for hours, and been stonewalled by bosses that most people basically shrugged off, because how I express myself in combat - the stats and buffs and consumables and gear I use - is different and gives me an advantage over some bosses and is flattened by others.

It's fitting that this joke ~~originally came from~~ is stolen from IronPineapple, because he covers a lot of games that make this mistake in his Steam Dumpster Diving series. A lot of fans of Souls-like games think that the difficulty is the defining feature. But it's really not, the games are hard but that's because they pull their punches *less* than other games (though they still heavily favor the player). But to counter this, the player gets *way* more options than most ARPG's give you that can give you the edge over your enemy *if you know how to leverage them*. You can't have one without the other, the game doesn't hold your hand but *that's because it gave you the options that an easier game would have handled for you*.",1647374205.0,6

But sadly I fear that companies will look at the formula and miss interpret everything.

Like the lack of a quest track, or how devoided of orientation the game is to make navigating the world and finding things as rewarding as possible. I fear this will be subverted to thinking that games with bad uis should be the norm, or that lack of content = having to explore to find quests.

To me what makes ER great is how nothing is given to you for free. And you can play the game and miss a lot of amazing stuff, but the devs don't put an arrow trying to direct players to that amazing piece if content they threw in hundreds of hours creating. Instead if you find it then it just makes it even more amazing that you actually found that amazing moment or item.

I feel like ER invoque a sense of high punishment but also high reward in the sense that you need to try to get the best out of the game, and if you chose to not devote yourself to it, then it won't give everything back at you. It gives in equal proportion to what you are willing to invest I exploration, time and paying attention to what the devs created.

I might be a bit enamored with the game right now, but I honestly feel like few games have the guts to throw a player into a gigantic world full of content but hide the best away and force you to work for it.

The game feels incredibly angled towards magic users, feels really unbalanced in a lot of places even when I farmed runes and leveled up EXTENSIVELY because it felt like some bosses scaled with me and a few other problems.  Also, if enemies can attack me while I'm viewing the map, why can't I open it during combat?  I get you don't want to allow fast travel, so lock that off, but sometimes I needed to look at my map to make sure I was fleeing in the right direction. 

That said there are a lot of QOL improvements such as no stamina use when not in combat, proper jumping and double-jumping, how the fast travel is pretty much always available except in combat, etc.

You need to make it rewarding, either by having some challenging and fun encounters or some form of reward that is somehow interesting. They also need to stop handholding so much when it comes to exploration, I don't need to know exactly where everything is. Not having any question marks or waypoints to where stuff is made me naturally want to explore the world.

When you see a world filled with spots of interest, it gets daunting and it feels like checking boxes. While it is not truly any different in Elden Ring, you never feel like you should go there and investigate it just so that you can make the icon on the map green, you do it because you want to see what is there. When you yourself decide that it looks like an interesting place to visit, it just feels more rewarding.

And games have to have more unique rewards, which also means a much more set in stone gear and loot system. I am so fucking done with randomized RNG loot, that never feels rewarding to me. Whenever I find a new cool weapon in Elden Ring, I may not use it, but it is usually always interesting to just try it out for a few fights, just to see if this is perhaps something I would like to play with on a different build.

And of course the best thing about Elden Ring is that the world is so intricate and just so detailed in how it is designed that you want to explore every little corner of it. So many secret paths and just naturally cool locations to explore. After a while, some of the encounters do become repetitive and sometimes you face similar bosses. But it is still enjoyable because you always get something out of it.

The biggest issues I have with Elden Ring and its design is upgrading weapon costs, it kinda defeats the purpose of creating your own build when you feel forced to stick with the first weapons you get because it just costs too much to upgrade new ones. And while it may be an unpopular opinion, I wish the story was told with more cutscenes and a bit more exposition as I still don't know what is really going on in the world. I don't need a quest log to show me where I should go next, but some form of record of people I have met and their dialogue would help a lot. I feel kind of forced to look up on the internet to see what I may have missed.

This is so far one of my favorite games of all time, if someone can make a game like this with the level of story and NPC interacting that Witcher 3 has, it would be a true masterpiece of a game.",1647373567.0,1

Dark souls feels like a card game. You want to collect all the cards then make your deck with crazy combos and interactions. In elden ring I want all the tools available so I make my crazy combos.

It's like half half, seems like half the players are completionists and the other half are experience purists. None are wrong. 

The map is really too big to spend this much effort searching for every tricky hidden dungeon.

If you *don't* want to hand hold, then you need interactions that teach you how to play the game.  This is something that From is generally very good about doing.  They teach you obvious things quickly (""you're going to die, and that's okay""), but they also teach you other things (""You just got shot by an arrow.  Here's a shield.  Try not getting shot by arrows anymore,"" ""Here's a boss that isn't putting up with your rolling around shit; learn to parry or die,"" etc).  Other developers look at From games and say, ""Okay, got it.

Most of the focus now seems to be on delayed attacks where you have to memorize the timing. Though depending on your build you can somewhat mitigate both of those by using a shield with good stability and damage absorption and be able to block most attacks where it then just becomes a matter of having good stamina management so that you don't get guard-broken while blocking. Another option would be to make a glass cannon mage build where you summon spirit ashes at the start of every fight to distract the enemy for you while you sit back and cast spells from afar.

So all things considered I don't think you'd have a huge problem with the game with slower reaction times. It may somewhat limit what kinds of play styles you'd be able to viably do but you'll always have options available to be able to reliably overcome any challenge.",1647374919.0,2

Without spoiling anything for others who don't have as much progress, there is a huge problem with quest lines in the game. One quest line gets locked if you complete an optional dungeon too early.  Too early doesn't mean you do some speed run skips or warps, it literally is just arbitrary. You can progress and most people who don't look at guides will just follow the path thats open to them and accidentally lock themselves out of it. 

Did I also mention this questline has a bunch of items(weapons and armor) locked behind it? It does and it frustrates me that you can lock yourself out of it. I'm fine with this style of thing if it was a choice(x or y questline for dungeon), but you can literally do everything if you hold off on x until y is done. Its not a choice, its bad design. 

Not to mention, some npcs early in the quest tell you that the quest isn't morally good. Most people might shrug that off since its a Soulsborne, but new players might think ""Hey, I should do this quest line after the other one since it might have permanent negative effects"". It doesn't.

I get that you don't need every item to have fun in the game, but that should be up to player choice, not player knowledge. FF12 had a more extreme version, if you opened any of a certain amount of fake chests, you literally couldn't get the best spear in the game. These chests were randomly dispersed throughout the game and the game didn't telegraph and say ""Hey if you open certain chests, you might not be able to get x item"". This isn't nearly as bad as that, but it shares the same element of frustration due to a player not googling everything. I'm lucky I became obsessed with the game early in my playtime and came by this fact. Otherwise, I might have locked myself out.

So whats the solution? Either don't make the questlines you are locked out of lock you out of items(for example, you could have an alternative way of obtaining the items), make it a clearly telegraphed choice, or make the questline not dependent on arbitrary completion. You can easily make another npc offer a similar questline if for some reason the choice makes the original quest giver angry at you.

For anyone early on that might be deterred from playing blind by this, maybe I can give a bit of info to help. If you are doing an optional dungeon(or at least one that you aren't sure of), make sure you complete any quests you want before the final boss of that dungeon.",1647369538.0,3

1. Balance. It's pretty poor thanks to the open world both in upgrading and natural progression.
2. The final third. It's absurdly difficult in bad ways, not ""fair"" ways.
3. Reused assets. Much like all open world games, if you need to reuse that many assets, shorten the game instead of doing the opposite and padding it.
4. Boss design. The movements themselves and the difficulty feel worse than before. My #1 complaint is the lack of ability to punish, mostly with the main story bosses. I think BB, DS3, and Sekiro blow ER out of the water with boss design. There's zero flow and some of the actual choices are baffling. Shit like Radahn and Malenia don't even seem to have been playtested. Then add shit like how about midway through the game, the game gets lazy as fuck and just starts spamming gank fights with previous used enemies.
5. The open world. It's empty. I'm kinda baffled people are claiming it's dense. It has no more weapons or enemy variety than something like DS3 which is obvious much less smaller. Exploration isn't really worth it if you like your current weapons and/or ashes. Like I don't miss collecting BS collectibles just for  shit achievement, but the world is quite barren. It doesn't feel lived in at all.
6. Side content. I know this is FromSoft's thing but if you're gonna have a 100+ hour game, you need something other than combat. There's nothing other than combat.  Other open worlds like Witcher, Horizon, Oblivion, etc. don't add random content like side mission, parkour challenges, mini games, puzzles, etc. because they're padding the game. They know that if you're gonna spend a long time on something, it's nice to break the flow. That doesn't exist in ER. The exclusive thing to break flow is exploration, exploration that leads to more combat.
7. Side missions. Keeping the same side quest style as Souls/BB/Sekiro is just dumb. You can't be as obtuse when you're switching from 20/30 hours to 100. They don't even have a log.",1647369020.0,3

Yea the final part has been hard but I also had low vigor so I just invested in Health and I was good to go there's plenty of ways to get tons of runes for leveling. 

Compared to many other open world games I've played this game doesn't reuse nearly as much. Sure it's less exciting when you fight the same enemy or boss again but one the reused bosses are pretty much all optional meaning your expectations aren't as high and two there's so much unique locations and enemies that the reused stuff isnt as bad. I can't think of another open world game with this much distinct visual variety and enemy variety. 

That boss point is super subjective and for me and many others it's just learning attacks or using the right tools no boss has really seemed unfair just some take longer to learn than others. 

I don't understand how you think the world is empty there's so much stuff all over the place and the lack of objective markers makes it better to explore it isn't that stupid checklist style of open world. If you're not willing to experiment and try new load outs than it's your fault the rewards are boring for you. Respecing is easier than ever and you can't blame the game when you're refusing to change how you play and try something new.  

It's a souls game and you're surprised it has souls gameplay im for one glad they don't just add a bunch of open world bs and stick with what they do best and do that one thing well. 

Yea there's no quest log and it's a bit annoying but the side quests I do solve on my own are super satisfying. These game are vague and obtuse so the community can discover things together and it's that which makes these games so enduring.",1647370598.0,1

Nothing stops you from just not beelining straight to whatever meta gear you can grab to trivialize zones.

As far as reused assets go, there are a few annoying examples but the majority are overblown. Erdtree guardians and the rot beasts are definitely the worst examples. Crucible knights are another frequently listed example but I feel there's enough variety amongst the variants to defer that complaint.

Your complaints about the bosses are too vague to properly respond to. The only thing I can see is ""the windows of opportunity are too small"". This is just a case of the git guds. You're not supposed to be able to nuke them down in one or two combos like many bosses could be cheesed in past games. The new design is intended to make the fights as a fight instead of a quick comp stomp.

As far as exploration goes the map is certainly larger than it needs to be, which is why you get a horse for travel. The point with exploration is that every point of interest has something worthwhile. Not that it has something for every build, or for every playthrough. Just skip it if you don't want the loot.

Most of your listed examples just have checkbox collectibles aka garbage filler content. Obviously if you like checking boxes then you'll enjoy games where boxes are being checked, but it has no place in Elden Ring's setting, nor does it fit the gameplay.

Why can't you keep a log? Try pen + paper. Again, if you just want to check boxes then you can buy a checkbox simulator.",1647373526.0,1

Magic CAN be effective in certain fights but again it‚Äôs not universal.

Saying it gives you EVERY option is a flat out lie. It‚Äôs a lot of experimental trial and error but the issue is that because information isn‚Äôt clearly conveyed to the player you don‚Äôt really know what does and doesn‚Äôt really work without looking it up outside what the game provides you.",1647374366.0,2

Ignoring that I flat out just don‚Äôt think a lot of this is true (green arrows really feel like a stretch).

If it were, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good design for the average gamer due to what you SHOULD be doing.

Going to the castle right away, for most gamers new to this series, is an absolute death wish. While I agree the castle should be the ultimate first major goal, it‚Äôs way too close to where you start.

Better design would have been placing your spawn in an area where your only choice was to do a lot of exploring before you hit the castle and with nothing really behind you.

It‚Äôs really weird that there is an entire island behind you with arguably easier enemies and dungeons that‚Äôs really out of the way compared to the one you start in.

Not that it‚Äôs a bad game (love it and most enjoyable platinum I‚Äôve gotten in awhile) but I think people go into this as Souls fans and veterans.

You see examples of these principles being used across mediums (movies, tv, photography, graphic design, etc.) so why everyone in this thread is having such a hard time believing experienced video game designers would be employing them too is baffling to me.  


Sure, there is more that goes into level design than just this, that's not what OP was saying.

Elden Ring's early game experience poorly communicates its expectations to the player. You have it hammered into you pretty early that you're supposed to follow the Guidance of Grace to the next main objective, and all of my 'first FromSoft game' friends fell for that and thought they were supposed to take on Stormveil before anything else.

They all spent hours slamming their head against that wall, with a few prevailing and the rest eventually figuring out that the game expects you to explore Limgrave first.

I also disagree that the Tree Sentinel is supposed to be your first obstacle, or at least an immediate one considering how hard he hits during the beginning of the game. I have no issue with his inclusion, and I think he's an awesome challenge, but I don't think praising him being one of the first things you see because he's supposed to be your 'first obstacle' holds up.

Their level design is pretty amazing, to be fair, but again... they really could have worked on better communicating their expectations to the player.

BOTW for example uses a cutscene when you enter the world to show the end goal in the distance over a landscape with not many features, also you're on the edge of a cliff with no indication of where to go next... until the camera swoops around over 90 degrees passing over some large mountain features in the distance  to point you down the only path then cuts to an npc who heads in the direction of the first story moment.

From Software does all this and more in one view. It allows the world to guide the way, not the camera.   

BOTW is meant to be easier and more obvious so using camera cuts to draw focus isn't a bad thing, but at least at the beginning of the game there's stuff in the distance in multiple directions with no sense of how to get there or what's beyond, (it does eventually gives you those things.)

You summed things up well at the bottom of your post but for some reason feel the need to be nitpicky.
 
Its not literally every line and only those lines:
this would look silly and artificial, of course there are some lines not aligned with the focus of attention its supposed to look like an open organic world.   But if you were to draw an arrow over every single visual element the length and numbers of the lines radiating from/to the church would noticeably stand out.  

There also doesn't need to be an actual arrow type end indicating direction : if the majority of lines focus on a single point it naturally draws attention there. the other end of the lines have no focus because they go every other direction and don't add to anything


Besides even your examples of the ruins and bridge and towers do actually support drawing focus to the church. they create a horizontal cut off to frame the church between the bridge/castle line and matching line of the stone floor at the bottom of the image.  

They aren't leading lines for the church but they are for the ""where you're going"" part of the image - a secondary focus. 

And while the player doesn't know or need to know the story purpose of each visual element - its not over analyzing to point out this was likely a deliberate design choice to feature them all in one view.   

 Also a giant glowing tree is definitely not ""just a skybox""  every new player I've seen looks at it and goes ""whoa"".",1647369383.0,4

The NPC literally says to go down for a tutorial before going through the doors. There is even an item up on a ledge implying there is a way to possibly get to it if you go down.

That being said Elden Ring has a lot more deliberate design put into its world structure to guide players. Even the locations of the map fragments for each area and what parts of the map they uncover are meant to guide you towards a certain path (i.e. the very first map fragment when you enter the lake in Liurnia reveals the eastern coast of the lake, not the lake center itself, and not the west coast, that's very intentional). They put the guidance of grace markers for people who have gotten off the main story path to make it easier to figure out where to go next.

in ER there isn't necessarily a ""wrong"" way to go but there is definitely a loose path clearly intended by From. It's evident by things like map fragment locations, NPC locations and the progression through their quests (Hyetta is a big one that people say is hard to find, yet if you follow the way the map reveals you find her at every one of her locations really easily), item placement in different locations that look inaccessible, placing obvious easy to spot enemies like jellyfish around hidden entrances, large markers that stand out on the horizon from vantage points, as well as simple enemy scaling (you just got teleported to the crystal tunnels in caelid, you can't kill shit and get instantly wiped, maybe this is an area for later, just like the skeletons in DS1).

That's only accurate if you're not learning the fights, but Elden Ring is worse than other souls games in that there are times where they've scaled a boss with the expectation that you've spent X time exploring empty fields and grinding up Y levels to make a boss a 1-2 trial run fight like they tend to be in the other games.

Problem is people jump to conclusions. 

And while there's a whole load of fromsoft veterans who are super helpful, wholesome, and understanding of these plights from earlier installments and agree that open world made it even HARDER to find quests and NPCs, there's a whole lot of elitist players who loudly declare that the game design issues are actually the players' fault for not playing it the way THEY think it should be played.

Which means the User Experience devs looking at Elden Ring almost completely ignoring the entire UX part of game making and saying. ""This still got 10 out of 10? My life is a lie"" aren't looked at with nuance.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying ‚Äútengas‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you‚Äôre misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. ‚Äú¬øNo tengas?‚Äù is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are ‚Äúno tengas miedo‚Äù (don‚Äôt be afraid), ‚Äúespero que tengas dinero‚Äù (I expect that you‚Äôll have money), and ‚Äúojal√° que tengas mam√°‚Äù (I hope you have a mom).

4854,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1021,72417,0.96,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mam√°"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mam√°?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -„Äã ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mam√°) es triste"" -„Äã ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mam√°"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,4

4886,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1021,72417,0.96,"The thing is that Spanish has verb conjugations that alter the spelling of the word in slight ways according to who speaks, what is the subject, the time frame, etc., and in doing so the meaning of a phrase can change or become incoherent.

For example, compare [have](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EnVerbs.aspx?v=have) and [tener](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EsVerbs.aspx?v=tener).

The correct way to say ""you don't have a mom?"" is ""[t√∫] no tienes [mam√°]?"" (square brackets for words that can be omitted). This is indicative present second person (you).

""[t√∫] no tengas [mam√°]?"" doesn't make any sense because it's in the subjunctive mood, present, second person (you). Subjunctive is hard to explain, but it's a more ""what-ify"" way of talking. (I'm clearly ass at grammar theory.)

Plain water does not have the nutritional value they need to survive, so while it may not be harmful, it is a waste of effort and possibly increases the amount of time the parents spend away from the nest. The chick's parents will not return so long as they perceive a threat is near.

The only living thing benefiting from this act is the human who felt good about themselves after projecting their own feelings about thirst and the benefits of hydration onto an animal that has no need or concept of the act that was just performed.

Pop culture was much less fragmented back then and the biggest stars were far bigger. I don't think kids these days can appreciate how big stars like MJ, Prince, Madonna and movies like ET, Back to the Future, Star Wars were back in those days. Your grandmother knew about them. They were always on TV. World leaders and royalty would beg to meet with them. Everyone from network TV to Disney theme parks to movies wanted a piece of MJ. Kids in Africa and the Middle East loved MJ. It was ridiculous.

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyonc√© with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded. This century it seems more like songs have a very brief shelf life and peak after a few weeks and then vanish",1647359296.0,2

There was a show that aired after school called TRL (total request live) on MTV that would play a count down of the top music videos. It was super popular until reality TV took over the music video channels. The radio was huge, music videos played off that, then once the internet started picking up and people could find new artists through that, it started to kill off the radio and music videos. 

The Buggles has a song called video killed the radio star, which is spot on. To be big during that time, you had to have a music video. But then, the internet made access to music easier for everyone and now people can find any genre they like. In my opinion it opened the gates to both echo chambers (listening only to the same genre all the time) and widening people‚Äôs tastes as it is now easier to find new artists.

Truly, you have a terrific mind. Anyway, MJ was the original MJ (sorry #23). He wasn‚Äôt just popular, he had all of the popularity and it‚Äôs literally impossible to imagine without having experienced it. That‚Äôs a horrible answer, but it‚Äôs true. For several years he *was* pop culture. I hadn‚Äôt thought about this in forever but as soon as I saw your post I flashed back to several vivid memories of things like the Walkman that kept his tapes piping into my earholes, people wearing one sequined glove and very specifically-studded red leather jackets. Everywhere, all the time. The first POC on MTV. That was huuuge. The Beatles were big, maybe bigger than Jesus as they claimed. By comparison, MJ was bigger than god for a few years before fading slowly as times changed and he didn‚Äôt adapt in a way that resonated very well. He was still huge but as he was no longer defining culture, it seemed like he was increasingly lost in the tall grass. Then he spiraled and it was viscerally unsettling. ‚ÄúCringey‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even come close to describing the phenomenon. This was still before the allegations of him doing‚Ä¶ idk, whatever the hell he was doing at the ranch. His videos, which were packaged as equally significant as his singles, just got disturbing in an ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù kind of way. He didn‚Äôt seem entirely human anymore and he kept drifting away from being relatable in any way. There wasn‚Äôt nostalgia for at least a decade after Thriller, if not longer. When I hear one of those classic songs now, it‚Äôs like a gift. I don‚Äôt queue him up on streaming services. I don‚Äôt think of it. It‚Äôs probably because I discovered a love for music by people like Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and even Parliament.
I think that music resonates more and feels timeless. It scratches that itch that I‚Äôd otherwise get for MJ. At MJ‚Äôs peak, though, he stood higher than anyone. No one‚Äôs been there since.

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn‚Äôt listen or watch the video because of ‚Äúsatan‚Äù. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church ‚Äúdances‚Äô.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20‚Äôs at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that‚Äôs come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn‚Äôt miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ‚Äôs life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That‚Äôs fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you‚Äôll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince‚Äôs unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It‚Äôs like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn‚Äôt exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don‚Äôt really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

Mainly the way people discover new music/ artists. Nowadays it will take you 15-20 seconds to go find a Album/ Song/ or Artist that you have never heard of.

A lot of people just want to hear the big songs on the newer Albums and that's it. If you bought a record back in the 80s, it wasn't cheap. If you or your family bought it, you were going to listen to all of it, probably multiple times. They were $7.50-$10/ piece back then, so comparable to $26-$30 today's price after inflation. We wouldn't even pay that for a CD nowadays.

People got their music from the Radio, TV/ MTV (when they actually played music), or a Record/ Cassette that someone had purchased. That was basically it for the normal person.

6317,pics,[OC] I photographed this blue tit in the last light of the day.,TheTrailSeeker,1647344982.0,245,13798,0.98,"Not OP, but a few suggestions:

Use a longer lens or get closer. You can get away with some pretty outrageous high ISO if you're somewhere close to filling the frame. If you're cropping in a lot the noise becomes way more prominent.

Get more light on the sensor, so make sure the aperture is wide open and try dropping your shutter speed as low as you dare, then go even lower. Take pot-shots, you will get many blurry shots, but hopefully a few sharp ones. Lean on stuff to help stabilise your body and the lens. If your camera has a quiet or silent shutter use that. Hold your breath and press the shutter slowly. After a while you will do this automatically without thinking. (This all goes out the window when shooting moving subjects btw, then you generally need a high shutter speed, however most small birds often stay still for a few seconds at a time.)

Use single point continuous focus and most of the time you should aim for the eye or the edge of the eye. I'd recommend back-button focusing as well if you're not already using it.

Ideally you're shooting RAW and using lightroom or similar, dial in just enough ""colour noise reduction"" so that the coloured blotches disappear and leave luminance noise reduction at zero (really). Then add sharpening - again not too much it's easy to overdo. If you're feeling really fancy you can export to photoshop unsharpened, then resize to whatever screen resolution it will be displayed at, then duplicate layer and add unsharp mask, then add a layer mask and paint it so that *only the areas which have detail are sharpened*.",1647377919.0,1

Joe Manchin, for all his faults and ties to energy, has spoken out against Russia.

""Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said that as the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election continue, it's important to note that Russia is not an ally.""Russia is not our friend. And to treat Putin as an ally and a friend is wrong. I don't look at him as a friend. I don't look at Russia. And I am very skeptical of what they're doing, their intentions. There are a lot of good people in Russia that don't have any say whatsoever,"" Manchin said on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.""

I want to reiterate that because there's this idea that somehow it's not sexism. Sexism is why that hate circle-jerk existed: She was perceived as an uppity bitch. She was always ambitious, and somehow that made her unacceptable in a way that never mattered for any male candidates. Sure, there's some grumbling about ambitious men in politics, but nothing like what Hillary got.

As for her politics, most complaints about her were divorced from her actual stances. She was always slightly left of the center of the Democratic Party on social issues, slightly to the right on foreign policy. Which is to say, basically the same as every major Democratic primary candidate for president since 1992 ‚Äî¬†Bill, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, Al Gore, John Edwards, John Kerry, Bernie Sanders (yes, Bernie, he has a lot of bluster but his actual policy proposals are pretty similar to the mainstream of the Democratic party), Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden. All of them. The extremes that people painted her with ‚Äî¬†whether as a Reaganesque neoliberal or as a left-wing extremist ‚Äî¬†never reflected her actual politics, but were largely a post-hoc justification for hating her.

We don't even do this for most of the oldest and trustiest of NATO states. Putting nuclear armaments into a state that's clearly as compromised by Russia as Ukraine, that shares an incredibly insecure border with Russia and other hostile states that absolutely cannot be protected, would be massively foolhardy. 

On top of that, Ukraine having nuclear armaments wouldn't have deterred Russia in the slightest. Because just like the US, Russia has a first strike doctrine for the use of tactical nuclear weapons. And every expert on Russia and Putin that exists has made it very clear that Putin has absolutely no fear whatsoever of getting into a nuclear exchange. If we thought there was any possibility he was bluffing, we would have called his bluff and moved in immediately. 

He's not bluffing. He's itching to prove that Russia has the will to wield nuclear weapons. He's itching to show how strong Russia is. 

And if the US had nuclear weapons programs in Ukraine, don't you think they would have done a better job of hiding them? Do you think we would have let Russia invade Ukraine if we had bioweapon labs, and nuclear weapons programs laying around that would lead right back to us?

If you just apply the slightest amount of critical thinking, pretty much every Russian narrative collapses. 

This is just more bs out of the Russian bs factory. These motherfuckers blow more smoke than the fucking industrial revolution. They will do and say anything to justify their actions. They will keep repeating this process of turning neighbors into rubble and annexing them until someone stops them.

Russia. Bubbe. I have some bad news for you.

Ukraine can totally do that and it's all your fault.

You know how you guys did that whole Annexation of Crimea thing back in 2014 and how you're doing this cute little BRUTAL unprovoked invasion + war combo platter thing now?

See, Ukraine destroyed their old nuclear arms back in 1994, after you agreed to never invade them.

Budapest Memorandum? Ring any bells? 

It contained the following;

1. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.

2. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

3. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.

4. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.

5. The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm, in the case of Ukraine, their commitment not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies, by such a State in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon State.

6. Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments.


Do you know what happens when someone who signs a contract decides to break that same contract?

The entire contract is thrown out of the window.

You've invaded Ukraine. Twice.

Guess what? You broke the contract you signed. 

You're the baddie.

Ukraine can develop all of the nukes it wants with anyone it wants. You unlocked that option for them 8 years ago.

You know what else, Russia?

China knows that you break contracts and lie. They don't care because they're using you. They do the same things too. They're doing it to you now. You're going to go broke and become their power station and their second bakery. The Chinese are going to swoop in and buy you up for pennies on the Yuan.

 >The big lie (German: gro√üe L√ºge) is a gross distortion or misrepresentation of the truth, used especially as a propaganda technique. The German expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, to describe the use of a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone ""could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Hitler claimed that the technique had been used by Jews to blame Germany's loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist political leader in the Weimar Republic.

It will be more and more difficult for Russian citizens to hear or believe the truth of what's going on.

The same thing happened in Nazi Germany, when it was isolated and under an umbrella of extremely effective propaganda.   

This is long, but worth reading. It is an excerpt from *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.* The author explains how he, even though he knows the truth, felt like he was going nuts surrounded by so many brainwashed people. It happens. **Propaganda works.**

>I myself was to experience how easily one is taken in by a lying and censored press and radio in a totalitarian state. 

>Though unlike most Germans I had daily access to foreign newspapers, especially those of London, Paris, and Zurich, which arrived the day after publication, and though I listened regularly to the BBC and other foreign broadcasts, my job necessitated the spending of many hours a day in combing the German press, checking the German radio, conferring with Nazi officials and going to party meetings. 

>**It was surprising and sometimes consternating to find that notwithstanding the opportunities I had to learn the facts and despite one's inherent distrust of what one learned from Nazi sources, a steady diet over the years of falsifications and distortions made a certain impression on one's mind and often misled it.** No one who has not lived for years in a totalitarian land can possibly conceive how difficult it is to escape the dread consequences of a regime's calculated and incessant propaganda. 

>Often in a German home or office or sometimes in a casual conversation with a stranger in a restaurant, a beer hall, a cafe, I would meet with the most outlandish assertions from seemingly educated and intelligent persons. **It was obvious that they were parroting some piece of nonsense they had heard on the radio or read in the newspapers.** 

>Sometimes one was tempted to say as much, **but on such occasions one was met with such a stare of incredulity, such a shock of silence, as if one had blasphemed the Almighty, that one realized how useless it was even to try to make contact with a mind which had become warped** and for whom the facts of life had become what Hitler and Goebbels, with their cynical disregard for truth, said they were.

It's not just Russians and Germans, a significant portion of any country's population will listen to their government in a time of crisis. Well over 50% of the American population firmly believed that Iraq has WMDs and the invasion of that country was justified. (they did not, it was not)",1647362402.0,285

Everything was planned internally to distract all the attention from Ukraine's people and make her the victim. This is one of Russia's propoganda methods - to reach people emotionally.

How often do you film your TV screen when there are random evening news? I guess never, but somehow a lot of videos appeared from regular people recording their screens when this happened live.

After this ""live"" video, she instantly puts out a video where she regrets. Reason - to strike our forgiveness.

This just shows how much deeply you have to check the information you see or read.

Stay aware people.

Not sure if it would be a good idea.

If the only way Russians could make money if they protest. We could just pay every fine any protester in the country faces. Would maybe incentive people to protest more. They still face prison but there isn't much we can do about that.

Unfortunately it's would probably be abused and Russian would claim the money somehow.

Also from a propaganda view we would don't want to give Putin ammo that the West is paying people to disrupt the country. Would play straight into his propaganda machine

The number people they have killed or jailed is still far less than the people they haven't killed or jailed. 

The largely English speaking population of Reddit only knows of these events through articles that occasionally pop up on /r/worldnews. Remember, you won't see an article titles ""Putin does nothing to journalist that opposed him"" on reddit, except for maybe today.

There is a major, glaring, disconnect here between what Redditors think Russia is like, and what it's really like. None of this is to say press freedom is alive, and being a member of the opposition is good for one's health in Russia. However, the Reddit mindset of ""oh, they looked at Putin wrong, they dead now"" is way off base, and there would have been a revolution in Russia long ago if that was the case.

For all of the stupid shit Putin has done recently, he has still historically been meticulous and calculating. He didn't become as unchallenged and powerful as he is overnight, and he didn't do it by literally killing everyone that opposes him. He has only targeted key people who he could silence and get away with, and only when they posed a perceived threat to him.

In this scenario, silencing her would do far more harm than good. And that doesn't mean she'll get killed in a week or two either - believe it or not Russians do have this little thing called ""memory"".

People commenting shit bellow like ""Putin never forgets"", like he's some fucking elephant, are so disconnected from the real world it's hilarious. He's a dictator who's been responsible for the deaths of thousands, but he's not some fucking comic book villain who is literally every single evil thing you can think of at once. He's a real person, running a real (authoritarian) government.

More likely than anything, Putins regime will keep her alive, maybe try to attack her character, but most importantly... They'll point to all of the comments by people like the average redditors, and now the UN, and say ""look how ridiculous these people are, she's still alive and was never at risk"".",1647367838.0,12

And the fact is, we've known there were ""good Russians"" since day one, when we began seeing people dragged off by the cops for holding up signs saying ""No War"" or sometimes even nothing at all. Nobody has mentioned removing sanctions for their sake, and nobody was talking about it when she did this either, until the conspiracy theory that it was a psyop got going. If lifting sanctions was her goal, her FB video would at least have mentioned them or made some artful reference to how hard everything is right now or money problems or something. She didn't do that. She said that Putin started the war, that she had lied and covered up facts about the initial invasion, Navalny's poisoning, and so on. Nothing about money or sanctions.

Just trying to explain that 'factory farm' is a made up term for a practice of animal housing that reduces water and air pollution, reduces carbon footprint and controls zoonotic illness through isolation and people's heads start to explode.

Trichinosis has been almost completely eliminated in the US hog population due to the inherent environmental isolation of 'factory farming'.

Mention that corn is a grass or that 'corn fed beef' is simply beef cattle being fed a cheap dairy ration to fatten up and they also get fed hay at the same time and boy howdy do people get mad.

Say that feeding corn silage to cows is fine and someone will authoritatively claim that it's bad and you should be feeding grass like alfalfa, even though every part of that statement is wrong and not backed by nutritional science and you will feel their wrath.

Say that using chemical fertilizers to replace soil nutrients used by the crops gown in it is the definition of sustainable agriculture they'll call you an uneducated hillbilly that doesn't know how anything works.

To be fair, the current situation is *way* milder than, say, the '92-'96 period, where stores couldn't operate because the bulk prices were increasing by 20% throughout the day. That's what hyperinflation looks like, and why it's devastating to an economy on so many levels.

It's only been a few weeks, but outside of imported stuff now costing way more (and a lot of categories are straight up not available anymore due to sanctions, like computer equipment), everything else remains largely stable. If Putin is somehow deposed within a month, the new government might have some semblance of an economy to work with, but if it doesn't happen by the summer, the hyperinflation will almost surely kick in and everything will rapidly go to shit. Whoever has any savings now will try to exchange it for useful products (whatever's still available) before that happens.

And I always remember the anecdote of one of my friends who paid off a 3-year car loan in 2 months during the '98 default and subsequent hyperinflation. It turns out that as long as you have a job and your salary keeps up with inflation rates, it's downright beneficial to get into debt before shit hits the fan.",1647369038.0,3

Some classics were dealt rough hands, As you mentioned Toy Story, When the 3rd movie came out and it ""ended"" I thought it would be great if they remastered the 1st in the style of the 3rd. 

We've seen it in games, a remaster of an old classic with a modern update. Some movies deserve that treatment. Though choosing which ones get that is a tough choice, for example I don't think we need to touch up The Lion King or Lilo and Stitch but others may disagree.  It's all up to one's opinion.",1647366847.0,1

I watched a video about Asian made films gaining mainstream popularity in the west, and western studios starting to cater to the Chinese market.

These films are obviously going to have little international appeal.

Kung Pow though, it's just a dumb comedy riff on wuxia kung-fu, which many older Americans have memories of watching on public access. I think that person is looking too deep into this. It's also 20 years old.",1647375574.0,1

Everyone here is writing other factors that may contribute to depression. But COVID-triggered depression is weird or, better stated, different on it own.

The big difference between both is that, and this is anecdotal, the first one, it‚Äôs kinda just degenerating state over time that you can back track from traumatic events, but covid-triggered is way different it is like you are one person and then just like that you are grey (to me it took just about 1 week to descend into a depressed state) it just happens. 

I had a not severe, mostly asymptomatic case. But one of my doctor‚Äôs colleagues committed suicide after a two week severe case, recovering and months of treatment for depression (at the moment diagnosed as PTSD).

Many key limbic and paralimbic structures are affected with COVID: orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate, temporal pole, insula, and amygdala. If this bears out, it is no surprise whatsoever that people are experiencing increased anxiety, depression, and worse. Those structures are directly related to emotion and regulation of emotion.

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.  

ICU delirium significantly contributes to injuries in the hospital setting and increased length of hospitalization and can result in PTSD, depression, and personality and/or memory changes that persist after the hospitalization is over and delirium has resolved.",1647360852.0,44

Say what you will about some of the terminology used in this description of the ""pain body"" which really resonates with me, but in my experience, this has been useful.

A tl;dr version could be: hurt people hurt people (including themselves)

Or: misery loves company.

""
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, ‚Äúbecome you,‚Äù and live through you. It needs to get its ‚Äúfood‚Äù through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. 

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn‚Äôt really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane. 

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don‚Äôt face it, if you don‚Äôt bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn‚Äôt make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth ‚Äî that is, make it real in your own experience. 

So the pain-body doesn‚Äôt want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength.""",1647367015.0,4

If you're expecting politicians to be good sources of information on matters of vaccine science, I can't help you there.

Edit: It's also worth pointing out that these vaccines *were* very effective against the original COVID strain and even against Delta so someone talking up the vaccine's capabilities and effectiveness certainly wasn't wrong back then. In the time since then, though, Omicron happened and now some dishonest debaters are holding those words against them even though they were said well before Omicron was even a concern. All told, though, if you got the jab expecting a ""miracle panacea"" against infection, I would question the sources you were using even in the earliest days of the vaccine roll out because that's never what the data said.",1647356178.0,24

Yes, vaccines help prevent Covid.  No, they don't 100% prevent Covid.    Yes, vaccines reduce severity of Covid.  No, they don't prevent hospitalization or death 100% of the time.

Personally, this was a nuanced and fresh take on depression that spurred a new perspective for me.

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,11

There are a couple primary ways to counter this. For one, comprehensive sex education for teenagers and young-adults should instruct students about the unrealistic, performative nature of pornography so they can understand what they are viewing when they almost inevitably watch it. That way that can approach their own sexual exploits with proper expectations. Second, consumers of pornography can seek out, and the industry can produce, more realistic pornography which depicts consent, actors with more 'average' bodies, and respect for female partners.‚Äù",1647377081.0,1

So I‚Äôm not shocked the 80s found nothing wrong with stalking as a whole. 

The other thing is that they write women as one dimensional irrational tools for the story. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like!‚Äù As a 2 hour long explanation of how to prove to their wife that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what it seems‚Äù because women are irrational and can‚Äôt be talked to. 

I never watched romcoms as a young teen because I didn‚Äôt like the plots. Now as an adult, I understand why I didn‚Äôt like the plots. 

Raunchy comedy has the same issue. Superbad literally pioneered consent in film. I remember Comedy Central playing a comedy where a man was raped while sleeping by a woman and his girlfriend walks in, and assumes he‚Äôs cheating on her. He was literally blacked out drunk and was raped on screen and this was ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù. No wonder so many millennial men hate women and can‚Äôt figure out how to date them, when their formative teenage years was filled with this trash or anime. Neither of which are particularly great at displaying that women are humans.

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape. I can‚Äôt help but wonder why this is even an option when someone reports sexual assault, in the same way I wonder why so many men think stalking is a way to win a woman back. It‚Äôs literally been built into our entertainment for generations to normalize these horrifying behaviors.",1647362419.0,8

In an era in which action against collective entities was discouraged among the general populace (e.g. a few hundred years ago), but action against individuals was encouraged (e.g. physical fights and duelings seen as legal), this might reverse.

Heck, it might even reverse in the USA less then 100 years ago when lynchings were de facto legal and unionization efforts scorned as communistic or otherwise un-American.

A good point brought up below was social media, which could be a societal reversion to a more balanced ability to act against both collective entities and individuals. OTOH social media also makes it easier for others to act against you, which might create a counter-balance away from individual enmity, as being hostile to an individual psychologically increases the thought that people will be hostile towards you.

Politics is the new religion.  People adopt beliefs as part of their identity and feel deeply threatened as opposing viewpoints are aired.  We all act like ""they"" do that, not ""us"" because we are all blind to this process.  We all claim that our beliefs are true or self-evident.  

Most drivers claim they are above average.  Most parents believe their children to be above average.  Most people tell themselves their beliefs are facts.

Age at death was similar in the overweight and statistically significantly younger in the classes I and II obesity group compared with the normal BMI group.

Importance  Abundant evidence links obesity with adverse health consequences.

 screens prior to its premiere. Fox was promoting the hell out of Brisco  
 County. 

 It's first Friday night was a 2-hour episode, the next Friday   
night, there was a ""UFO special"" on Fox after Brisco County, the third   
Friday night, Sept. 10, 1993, The X-Files started its run.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

  
 I used to work at a graphic arts company and our shift was 2p-10p m-f.    
Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick   
took over and our interest started to wane.",1647359676.0,4

Sam could just show up in a scene, crack wise or do a few cool things, and then fuck off back to drinking mojitos and chasing cougars.

I'm not sure if the character would have worked well in the lead. The movie they did was good enough, but weekly plots where Sam has to pull the weight of the narrative every time? Half the character's charm is that he scarcely ever gives a shit and is game for hijinks basically whenever, but a lead character has to be more invested than that.

Sam Axe has a constant ""I just wanna' go home"" energy whenever he's the focus of the plot, which is fantastic in short bursts, but wouldn't hold up to scrutiny in a spinoff where he's the perpetual focus. Character would have to change a lot to support it. 

Otherwise the viewer would constantly be asking ""why the hell is he even doing all this right now?"" else the writers would have to give increasingly flimsy excuses why his character isn't just fucking off and going home. In Burn Notice, he was always in the game for Mike and Fi or one of his buddies' sakes in a ""Sam's Buddy"" episode. He was always game to help people out, but he was rarely the one *seeking out the needy* and, in the absence of Mike's magnetic hero reputation, wouldn't be going out looking for wrongs to right. And the obvious answers, like ""Sam has money troubles and has to take jobs to pay for his new car or something"" makes him seem less sympathetic than his previous ""Sam is flawed but supremely loyal and good-hearted"" portrayal in Burn Notice.

He's too much of a ""minds his own business"" type to get into adventures without other characters like Michael or his cavalcade of buddies dragging him into the weekly shenanigans. And a ""Sam's buddy is in trouble every week"" formula wouldn't last very long, unless you focused an entire season on one single ""case"" and one well-characterized and developed long-term buddy. You'd need either a radically different weekly formula, or some inciting incident that turns Sam into more of the weekly-hero type.",1647362283.0,8

The network also pushed for more interpersonal conflict and the cromags as a 'big bad guy'. They drove the professor out & replaced him with a playboy playmate.

From what I understand (not a horse expert) horses don't do this today because 1) they're trained to be more used to cars, and 2) the equipment they make them wear when they're on a road where they might see a car usually prevents them looking anywhere but right in front of them, so they often don't see the cars moving.

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

Then they flew both the F105F and then the F105G. The F model flew with external electronic warfare pods. The G models had their electronic equipment stored internally on both sides if the aircraft. 

They flew as hunter killer teams. One aircraft flew low and slow trolling for SAM sites. When a site came up the hunter would lock on the Radar signal. The weasels would fire either an AGM 45 or AGM 78 missile. Some times the radar would stay on too long and the missile would guide down and destroy the site. Even if the site was hit an additional aircraft would fly down and destroy what was left with bombs.

Other times the radar site would shut down and the missile would go ballistic. Without guidance from the radar site the SAM would either run out of propellant and crash or just blow up without damaging our aircraft.

Either way, the attacking aircraft would be safe. Then again on their way out the Weasels would keep the sites from trying to shoot down any more aircraft.

It was very dangerous and quite often one would be shot down.

The motto ""YGBSM"" came about when the Weasels were first told about their mission. One of the pilots stood up and said ""You got to be shitting me"", hence the YGBSM. The standing joke among us maintenance people who worked on the Thud Weasels was our motto ""YGTBSM"". This stands for "" You got ta be s√ó√ótting me"".

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular.

My favorite use of your version of this tactic is in operation desert storm, by BG Larry Henry (call sign Poobah).

He flew un-manned drones towards these sites, and the Iraqis, thinking they were American f-15s and 16s, turned on their radars and fired.

They even triumphantly reported kills!

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

Meanwhile, Russia doesn't really train to do SEAD nor have they really had an operational need for it before Ukraine.  This is the first time Russia went up against a near-peer military.",1647316046.0,125

At least some of the torpedo bombers had air cover. The problem was that the technique the USN was using at the time sucked.  
Some examples:   
The Enterprises fighter squadron VF-6 was providing cover for Hornets torpedo squadron VT-8 (VF-6 had lost the group of planes it was intended to cover and had basically 'latched' onto VF-8 instead). The issue was that the USN plan was to fly ""high cover"", so the USN fighters were high and the bombers were low, and as a result the USN fighters didn't do much (anything?) to interfere with the Zeros.  
When Enterprises torpedo squadron came in while VF-6 was still in the air and still ineffective.  
Yorktown's strike actually came in together, with the fighters (VF-3), bombers (VB-3) and torpedo aircraft (VT-3) arriving together. They went in as a single strike but one of the ways Japan had of dealing with their CAP being drawn away was keeping 'ready' aircraft on the decks which could be launched to respond to new threats, so by the time they came in the USN fighters were massively overmatched in number (6 USN fighters vs 40+ IJN fighters). VT-3 was also screwed in that they ran headfirst into the fighters chasing down the departing survivors of VT-6. 
  
> The Devastators drew the carrier's Zero cover downwards and they didn't have time to regain altitude when the other bombers arrived.  
  
VT-6 was also the only squadron that really had any effect at drawing the cover downwards, as they actually went in with other attacks. The other torpedo attacks were so early that there was plenty of time for the Japanese CAP to return to altitude. The idea of VT-8 (or VT-6) bravely sacrificing themselves to draw the CAP down is a myth that was created to try and pin a purpose to the slaughter of the torpedo squadron.",1647360789.0,2

NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

SFOD-A: A Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or ""A-Teams""). Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO, high altitude low opening), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.).

The movie [12 Strong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong) which is based on reporting by [Gary Schroen depicts their role either as forward observers, trainers, or other operational activities.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Schroen)

The CIA needed ODA teams on the ground to direct airstrikes. 12 strong illustrates roughly how that was done, including coordination with the CIA to bribe local warlords and removing MANPADS with large amounts of cash from Afghanistan.

SFOD-B: The ODB, or ""B-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11‚Äì13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field.

Note: Any time you read ""direct"", picture in your head shooting at the enemy. Direct fire = point and shoot. Indirect fire = artillery, mortars, fire from an unseen adversary.

SFOD-C: The SFODC, or ""C-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals, and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies.

SFOD-D: SFOD-D, or Delta Force is comprised of soldiers recruited from within the US Army's 75th Ranger's Regiment and the other occupational detachments. Strong focus on counter terrorism, clandestine operations. Generally works closely with the CIA's SAC/SOG.

Suffice it to say, Delta force are usually made up of former Green Berets. Functionally, due to the expected clandestine nature of their role they are separate but SFOD-A/B/C/D are all still under the command of JSOC and USSOCOM.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.  I was reading a few days back a thread of people who'd tracked cruise-missile launches by planespotting the rockets from cellphone cameras and CCTV back to the launch corridor within minutes.
