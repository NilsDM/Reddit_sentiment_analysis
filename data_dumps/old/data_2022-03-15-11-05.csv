213,funny,Dolphin trolls a seagull!,Ltcommander83,1647353576.0,343,17056,0.97,"The two instances of dolphin intelligence that stuck with me the most:

1) [The Dolphin fishermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwWfYLKFw0) in Brazil. Basically *the dolphins* figured out they can catch more fish if they work with us, so they purposefully chase schools of fish into our nets. This plan was concocted by the dolphins, ***NOT*** by the local fishermen, and the dolphins call the shots for all the fishing jobs. They signal, they choose where to fish, they choose when to fish, they're clearly in charge and the brains of the operation. All we did was recognize the value and play along.

2) Wish I had kept the vid of this but didn't wanna watch it again when I first found it: it was in Japan. A bunch of fishermen cornered a dolphin in a cove (is that the right word? Rock formation along the coast where you could block off one part and trap anything in the water) and it being Japan, of course the goal was to catch it and eat it. The dolphin was distressed and trying to escape, but couldn't. The dolphin's last ditch escape attempt...? It lept out of the water and onto the rocks, leaping towards one white, blonde tourist duo in a group of otherwise japanese fishermen. It was like the dolphin could recognize the dangerous ones and the *only* duo present that might help the dolphin, so the dolphin lept to them for help. That was....painful to watch. Whether the dolphin could recognize the difference due to the languages being spoken, the different physical features, the clothing or what have you...it doesn't matter. If they're smart enough to recognize such a difference and use that to make a logical conclusion, then we probably have no business killing and eating the damned things.",1647366909.0,1

409,funny,Solid business plan,Pizzacakecomic,1647345079.0,106,3825,0.94,"Webtoon's revenue sharing isn't amazing but it is better than most places, specifically because they do both 50% of the ad revenue, plus their tiered creator rewards program which gets you an extra $100 at the lowest tier (which has the same requirements as the ad share program in general). So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide. In my experience, the access to readership that WebToon offers (specifically after you bust past that 1000 subscriber/40,000 monthly pageview threshold, before which WebToon does very little to help you get views) is well worth it.",1647362430.0,4

Sometimes you‚Äôre even asked to put it there if the business has a small or often full parking lot. 

I used to work in a busy area and always parked my bike off to the side in front of the building and it was beneficial to everyone because I wasent taking up a whole parking spot that someone else could be using and also keeps the bike from being knocked over by an oblivious driver not paying attention (which even happens if the bike is parked at the end of the spot which is more visible) My college even allowed bikes to park anywhere on any parking deck provided you had your tag registered and paid the normal yearly parking fee and it wasent in the way which was a good benefit to everyone who drove cars and me because it wasent assigned parking plus I didnt have to constantly look for spots.

I believe there is general hatred towards all motorcycles (outside of the bad egg riders) because they are viewed as toys rather than legally registered financially efficient transportation options which is what they are, they just also happen to be fun to use.

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting - this is not unlike when you get a Check Engine light over something that‚Äôs not related to the engine 

It is called ‚ÄúReferred Pain.‚Äù  It goes against everything we understand about how pain signals work.  This is also why your left arm can hurt during a heart attack, but not many people are aware that other organs are innervated by the same exact nerve",1647349236.0,38

I saw a male urologist 2 days later and he felt my nut for about all of 2 seconds and says, ""Oh ya... that's coming out immediately. I have no idea what your doctor was thinking.""  


Had lefty removed 4 days later (November 2020). Biopsy took just over a month (again, thanks COVID). Stage 1a pure seminoma testicular cancer.

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back *(Edit: pushed back mostly using my legs, as I was in a crouched position)* and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind‚Äôs rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, ‚ÄúWell, now you‚Äôre just like the rest of us,‚Äù meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Didn‚Äôt need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn‚Äôt focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn‚Äôt remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I‚Äôve described seek medical attention.

Then she got her friend (yes the same one) to hook up with my buddy, who then convinced him to invite her to a party at his house I went to. I went into the bathroom and when I opened the door she was standing there. Freaked me the fuck out. I said ‚Äúhi, excuse me, I‚Äôm about to leave this house‚Äù when she pushed me as hard as she could back into the bathroom and came in and locked the door. At this point I freaked out and just started yelling for help. My buddy and a few others came and unlocked the door and pulled her out and I was able to get out of the bathroom. I started walking upstairs to head to the door and get in my truck to leave, when she flies out the door, and runs to my truck. She stands there while I am standing there in disbelief. At this point we had been broken up for months. I walk back inside and one of her friends approached me and told me if I told her, the friend, that I never wanted to see or talk to my ex again she would let me leave. I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving. 
This all happened after she did the following.
1) called me hundreds of times from a dozen numbers to which I blocked and requested she doesn‚Äôt call
2) egged new girlfriends car
3) tried to get me to do threesome
4) tried to make me fuck buddies
5) asked a very desperate friend of mine to prom hoping to get in our group
6) followed me to work, home

Two years later, I have a new phone number and am I‚Äôm college. I get a call and answer it. It‚Äôs her. No idea how she found me. She asked if I went to the local university to which I replied yes. I did not actually go there, I went to a state college. She enrolled in that university. 

That‚Äôs the end of that story

Update: thanks for the concern, this was 19 years ago and I‚Äôm safe. I only heard from her 1 more time and that was 15 years ago. Hoping that‚Äôs the end of it.

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off ‚Äújust over a block‚Äù from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I‚Äôd been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I‚Äôd been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

He had convinced himself in the time I was gone that we were going to be getting back together, but at that point I‚Äôd had enough time away to realize how terribly manipulative and cruel he was the entire time we were together so I was NOT about it. He kept telling me he wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer and he‚Äôd convince me. I kinda just ignored him, did my own thing. Hooked up with a mutual friend that I‚Äôd known way longer than I knew my ex, it had nothing to do with him but he took it personally. He found out, and wrote a song (he had an aspiring ‚Äúrap career‚Äù) about how much he hated me and wanted to kill me. Had my full name in it and everything. Turned every single one of my friends against me whether they thought I did anything wrong or not. Stalked me for three years and I have no idea if he‚Äôs still interested in me or not. I have an entire album in my phone of screenshots for court if it comes to that. He showed up at my moms house (he didn‚Äôt realize I wasn‚Äôt living there anymore), stalked my current boyfriend, showed up at my jobs, made multiple accounts to reach me on all social media. The shit he has sent me is INSANE. Like, psychotic thinks-he‚Äôs-Shakespeare kind of stuff. Half of it doesn‚Äôt make any sense. The horny messages are the scariest. I still have nightmares about him being in my house all the time. Terrible stuff

Worst part? His mom is a lawyer, and when I reached out to her to tell her about the stuff he was doing she told me it wasn‚Äôt her problem but she hoped we could work it out between the two of us because she missed me and thought we were great together :-)",1647306719.0,178

Break up time. It was my lease and she had no intention of staying there permanently, so I told her I would stay at a friend's house for the rest of the month, while she found a new place. Yknow, because i was ""nice"". That gave her about three weeks. I went on an impromptu road trip with my buddy about two weeks into it and when I got back, she let me know she had moved out while i was away, so about a week prior.

When I got back to my apartment, every single thing I  owned was piled up, in the center of the living room. This isn't an exaggeration. The apartment looked ready to rent to new tenants, except for the massive pile of furniture, collectibles, clothing, medicine cabinet contents, food from the fridge and pantry and since it was June...fucking MAGGOTS!! It took a week to really sort through. I kept finding more fucked up stuff, like my childhood teddy bear, ripped at his neck, so his head just dangled there, 25 year old stuffing, bleeding out. I kept imagining her, dragging heavy shit around, carrying on with this for days, probably.

Epilogue...I ran into ole girl again, about a year later at a show. She acted like she was happy to see me ""after all this time"" and as if nothing totally fucked the fuck up hadn't happened.

But the ex said she was going with her kids (we didn‚Äôt live together, obviously) to stay at a resort (live in LV) when in fact she was staying at NYNY casino with a truck driver. Said driver got extremely drunk and belligerent the next morning/afternoon and she clearly must have too, because she ended up passing out in his truck cab that evening as he in a rage withheld her phone from her. He evidently discovered the phone video of me and her doing the deed and proceeded to post it on her FB page. 
I started to get texts/ calls around 7pm from friends, then her close friends. Was insanely embarrassing and heartbreaking at the same time. I was in a bar within the hour trying to calm down. 

Since said video was not (because of the angle) breaking any FB decency rules and her being passed out, it took until 10-11am the next day before it was removed. By that time her ex husband (yeah, bizarre) already had a missing persons report with the police. Everyone from her hometown was bugging him and me (most thought I posted it, at first) as to where TF she was.

When I was a senior in high school, my friend since I was like 5 got kicked out of her mom's house. Her mom was chaotic and not the best parent so my mom let her live with us without much question. My brother had just moved out so we had a spare room.

My friend lived with us for.. let's say a few months, I can't really remember, and one day I give my debit card to my brother to buy me booze. He texts me and says it's declined. 

That doesn't seem right so I check my account. Sure enough, several ATM withdrawals for a couple hundred bucks over the course of a week or so have been made, and not by me.

So I get home from work and am complaining to my friend that someone stole all my money and I have to file a police report etc. She leaves saying she's going to her grandma's like 10 minutes after this. 

The cop comes, I tell him what happened, he says he'll look into it. I have to file a bunch of paperwork at my bank. It's a pain in the ass. Somehow it comes to be known the withdrawals have all been from the bank my friend uses, and my mom suggests maybe it was her. I totally refute that, saying there's no way my best friend would do that to me. 

The cop calls me and basically says like ""we tracked the withdrawals, watched the ATM footage, found out it's said friend, her dad would like to pay you back in full if you won't press charges."" I say sure.

After paperwork agreeing to these terms is signed, she tries to talk to me and I tell her to leave. Her grandma calls me and pleads me not to kick her out. That ship has sailed grandma.

Anyway she comes back to move her shit out and I sit on the couch watching pawn stars while she struggles to carry and load a box spring by herself. I never found out exactly what happened, I assume she'd just take my debit card while I slept and put it back before I noticed. I'm not sure how she expected not to get caught..",1647318961.0,29

I had took her home to meet the family and even attend a wedding together. After that, we decided we should move in together. So I left my apartment. I loved that apartment. I moved on November 24th. Things weren't working out. She wanted to fight all the time, and I found out the secret extra room she had was to practice her hoarding. Busy season at work started and we got into many fights.

The best one was when she called my older sister at 2 in the morning trying to ""tell on me"" what I did and that I was ""acting crazy and mad"" and my sister said ""What did you do to my brother? I know my brother and he doesn't get mad unless somebody's constantly fucking with him to stir him up.""

I made plans to move in with a platonic girl friend of mind to get me out of there and help her out with the rent until I busy season was over and I could do the whole apartment search thing properly. I was doing 14+hour days through all of this. I said ""this isn't working so Imma leave and I'm breaking up with you and Ill be gone by the end of today.""

MY phone started acting funny so I took it to t-mobile to get a new chip. That is when I found out she had been snooping my phone the whole time.

While I was at mobile

1. she called the girl I was going to move in with (just a friend) and threatened her and said all kinds of crazy shit.  Now my friend said I couldn't move in with her because she didn't want that crazy bitch around.
2. She called her friends and family and told them some story - probably of me abusing her, and they rushed over and hid in the house and packed my stuff and got prepared to ambush me.
3. I parked outside and I just wouldn't go in. My sixth sense wouldn't let me go in after her. I called my friend and asked for moving help.
4. MY friend showed up, we opened the garage and started grabbing my couch.

Just then the cops showed up, they had been called on ""domestic violence""

If my buddy and I weren't both holding each end of the same couch and looking totally confused, we would have went to jail.

Then her and her family sprung out of the house and started making all these allegations and veiled threats and I just said ""I'm leaving""

She ran over to me and started fake crying and saying ""we can work this out""

I was like ""no thanks"" and I thanked the officers for being there to protect me from whatever those people were planning.

The cop said It was the calmest domestic violence he had ever seen.

\-

I was lucky. If she would have gotten away with it I would have went to jail, lost my job, and my stuff, and caught a record - all over trying to break up like an adult.

He was set free Monday AM and went home to find that she'd sold his car, emptied the entire house, and drained their bank accounts over the weekend. Even his clothes were gone. She'd taken off with a new boyfriend.

I wasn't home, but she convinced the landlord (who knew us) to let her in. I had told the propery management specifically to NOT let her in. Anyway, I came home and my house was completely empty outside of my dog and an empty fish tank. I'm not exaggerating the empty. She took everything that wasn't nailed down. Food from the fridge, cupboards, pantry, etc. She took the SHOWER CURTAINs. We had two irons, she took both of them. Took my furniture, TVs, game systems plus games. This bitch even took the light bulbs out of the light fixtures. And not just the easy to access ones. The ones that are above those apartment panels everyone knows about.

I called the police and told them I had been robbed. When they got there the landlord said he let her in. Her name is not on the lease. They told me it was a civil matter and they couldn't do anything about it. I was obviously upset and being loud. My ex-army buddy was with me. The cops threatened to bash my head into the wall, called me a mutt (I'm mixed) and then left.

Editing because this comment kinda blew up:

We tried going after the property management. Unfortunately, their excuse was there was nothing in writing and the property management ""didn't recall"" me telling them not to let her in. She had already established domicile unfortunately, so she has the same ""rights"" that I do as a tenant. I would have had to evict her or prove that she somehow posed a threat to my life.

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

Produced by the BBC and RDF TV in 2002, truer than ever. And no, it's not a flat-earth baseless conspiracy theory, but rather an interesting take on how we got to where we are through public relations and mass psychology. From Wikipedia:

> ""Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed our perception of the mind and its workings. The documentary explores the various ways that governments and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew Edward Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in public relations, are discussed in part one. His daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in part two. Wilhelm Reich, an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.

People were stranded, without clean water, without food, medical care or electricity, for /weeks/. And then, they struggled to get the help they needed to rebuild their lives for years, being screwed by the system at every juncture.

What the film got right: 

Overfishing is happening. Serious human rights abuses. Specific kinds of aquaculture has led to environmental impacts. Unsustainable fishing is subsidized by public money. A large volume of gear is discarded , adding to plastic pollution. 

What did it get wrong?

Film misleads viewers on the status and magnitude of all the above concerns. Fish 
stocks are not going to collapse by 2048 (the source it uses is a 1996 paper that has been criticized and acknowledged to be a poor study even by its own authors!) 

Discarded fishing gear is a small component of plastic pollution. 
80% of plastic in the oceans comes from what we throw away on land (soda bottles, food packaging), 20% from marine sources (which is a problem, yes)

Its solution (to boycott/not eat fish) completely ignores the fact that fish and fishing play a critical role in the food security and livelihoods of millions of people around the world. 

Seafood is not full of ‚Äúpollutants‚Äù. Such absolute statements are misleading. 

The Marine Stewardship Council does not receive direct payment from the fisheries certified against its standard. 

Aquaculture is not just shrimp and salmon. 

The solution proposed (‚Äògo vegan‚Äô) is a VERY privileged position and cannot be adopted by everyone in the world.

Related  fun fact: the film was partly bankrolled by Leonardo DiCaprio, a 
very vocal (rich white dude) vegan",1647320336.0,7

Wich means, that as game developpement progress and as resolution increase, we could maybe see more and more scopes realistically rendered in fps.

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

So apparently in COD Cold War people complained that snipers ‚Äúscoped too fast‚Äù so ads time was increased and attachments were changed or taken away on snipers. It wasn‚Äôt too bad and you could still quick scope but that created another issue, people bitching about quick scoping in game. Apparently it‚Äôs frowned upon to quick scope in COD.

* It had the worst maps of any cod game to date. Far too big. The one remedy for large maps is ground war yet that wasn't released on the old gen consoles which most people had at the time. 

* One of BO2's best features was the introduction of League Play, a massively popular gamemode. It took IW a couple of months to put in a worse version of it into their game. 
 
* The sniping as mentioned in this thread - awful. 

* Then the worst one, removing SnD?? I understand they added it in after a month or so but that was too late. You can't just remove one of your top 3 most popular and iconic gamemodes.

It‚Äôs a little slower, one or two bullets kill, no future sci fi gadgets, can‚Äôt shoot whilst going prone or jumping, etc.  it‚Äôs all about strategy and long term communication.

Due to the way warzone works and the fact that it's the same application for both it and MW19, when you install MW19 it only installs all the stuff necessary for warzone. It's not until you boot up the game that it prompts you to install ""data packs"" for the multiplayer, campain, spec-ops etc. This is also the reason that all the ingame logos and titles say ""Call of Duty: Warzone"" now, instead of Modern Warfare, and why on the PC launcher, the game was renamed to ""Call of Duty: Warzone"". 

Also while there are obviously a lot of shared assets, especially before cold war came out, the fact that it includes all the weapons and skins/operators from cold war and vanguard, as well as an entirely new map not used elsewhere in mw19, means there's an unbelievable amount of bloat you're required to download and install just to be able to play the game you actually purchased 2 years and a bit ago.",1647365219.0,2

I think aim assist in consoles is misunderstood.  The point of it is not to make a game easier.  The point is to help make up for the lack of precision a joy stick offers versus a mouse.  I think aim assist is VERY appropriate in all console FPS.  Again, not because of the games realism, but simply because of the handicap that console gamer face versus PC.  

Now you can argue if there‚Äôs no cross play it doesn‚Äôt matter.  I would still disagree.  Why should my gaming experience but hurt on console.  To bring the console experience ***up to par*** with a PC FPS experience, consoles need aim assist.

That said I‚Äôve learned to overcome it in Insurgency and I need to admit - the game feels ultra realistic because of it.  Lining up a shot takes practice and focus, landing one is ultra satisfying.  But, and I mean this in the most altruistic way possible - lack of aim assist is hurting the player base count.

One of them is called the stencil buffer. When rendering the scope, other than just writing to the colour buffer (that's the pixels you see), you also write to this stencil buffer. So if the stencil buffers was just filled with 0s, you fill up the area the scope renders with 1s.

4412,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,750,47829,0.97,"This is absolutely incorrect.

‚ÄúTenga‚Äù is the wrong form of ‚Äútener‚Äù to use in this case. Guy in the video said it twice, knew it didn‚Äôt sound right, and corrected himself the third time.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying ‚Äútengas‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you‚Äôre misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. ‚Äú¬øNo tengas?‚Äù is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are ‚Äúno tengas miedo‚Äù (don‚Äôt be afraid), ‚Äúespero que tengas dinero‚Äù (I expect that you‚Äôll have money), and ‚Äúojal√° que tengas mam√°‚Äù (I hope you have a mom).

4413,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,750,47829,0.97,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mam√°"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mam√°?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -„Äã ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mam√°) es triste"" -„Äã ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mam√°"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,3

I remember just being a kid and watching one of his televised concerts, and even then marveling that he was the greatest performer in the world.

On the flipside, he became increasingly featured in gossip column and rumors. His name was being bounced around nonstop for one reason or another.

Edited to add: I remember a rumor about his signature moonwalk dance started to spiral out of control. Some people did not believe he could physically do it, and that it was some sort of trick involving mirrors in his shoes.

I don't think kids these days can appreciate how big MJ, Prince, Madonna etc and movies like ET, Back to the Future, Star Wars etc were back in those days.

One thing to remember is this is way before the internet was anything more than a nerd dream at DARPA, and mobile phones weren't even a thing. He achieved this fame in an analog world.  Maybe only Beatlemania was more powerful an event than Mr. Jackson, but I'm pretty sure that was limited to a few countries in the western world, Michael's fame was truly worldwide and longer lasting.

I don't even know if I'd say Thriller was his peak, I think it might have been Bad, the next album. I was a bit too young for thriller, although even then I was aware of it but as big as he was I think Bad cemented it. Around the same time we got Moonwalker, which I got to see in the cinema and one of the first Megadrive games I owned was a Japanese copy of the Moonwalker game.

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyonc√© with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded. This century it seems more like songs have a very brief shelf life and peak after a few weeks and then vanish",1647359296.0,1

I really can‚Äôt think of any male performer today who is known for their innovative choreography, but at the time it was pretty common for individual performers (Elvis, James Brown, etc.) and bands (think all of the 70s Motown bands with synchronized dance moves) to emphasize the dancing part of the performance as much or more than the actual music.

He moonwalked on the Earth and hee-hee'd into our hearts. He would sing these songs, and people would listen. He was really cool. If you were blind or lame, you went to see Michael Jackson and he would put his hands on you and you would be healed. That's so cool. He could sing better than Hendrix, he could have told the future, he could have baked the most delicious cake in the world. He could have won more Grammies than Sir Georg Solti, Michael would have been funnier than any comedian you can think of. Michael Jackson was way cool. He told people to heal the world and that he was a zombie. That's so cool. Michael Jackson was so cool. But then some people got jealous of how cool he was and made up stories about him. So they shunned him. But then he rose from the dead! He rose from the dead, danced around, and went up to heaven. I mean that's so cool. Michael Jackson was way cool. No wonder there are so many Michael Jackson fans.",1647349465.0,140

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn‚Äôt listen or watch the video because of ‚Äúsatan‚Äù. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church ‚Äúdances‚Äô.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20‚Äôs at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that‚Äôs come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn‚Äôt miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ‚Äôs life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That‚Äôs fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you‚Äôll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince‚Äôs unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It‚Äôs like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn‚Äôt exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don‚Äôt really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

""The jockstrap and other items were [bought by the HBO television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=orgvGLrNGGk) ...""

Subsequently, the memorabilia, including the jockstrap, were **donated to the last operating Alaskan Blockbuster Video store in Anchorage**.[4][10] The jockstrap remained there in a glass case along with other items from the Crowe auction and became a local attraction.[10] However, the items failed to prevent the store from closing in July 2018.[11] Afterwards, the owners of the Alaska store **sent all their memorabilia to** the last remaining Blockbuster Video store in the United States, located in **Bend, Oregon**.[12] However, **Crowe's jockstrap was missing** from the items sent to this store, with Oliver claiming in September 2018 that he **did not know its location**.""

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

5892,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,698,17281,0.94,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

Its also probably funny to watch now, because it came out in like 2008, before the ""death"" of the video store and before youtube became the juggernaut it is now.  It used the short vignette style of youtube videos as short spoofs of other movies, before it became SO commonplace due to youtube.  It has a similar feel to watching ""You've got mail,"" knowing that the big bookstore chains have all been driven into the ground by Amazon...you get what is happening in the film, and its relevant because of what amazon/netflix did to the BIG chains -- the movies are about what the big chains were doing to the mom-and-pop stores -- but there is this bit of a ""what goes around comes around"" feel to it that is hard to shake off imo.",1647343986.0,2

I visited a year ago and had a blast - it is one of 4 cities to have a volcano (extinct) within its city boundaries, and there's a cindercone butte in the middle of town that you can climb up for some decent views. On a clear day you can see Mt. Hood. There's also some lava tubes near town if you're into exploring caves - theyre quite linear so you dont have to fear getting lost. Just a bit south of town is the newberry volcano and Paulina lake; the lake is as normal a lake as any other, but if you dig a hole on the beach and let it fill with water, the volcanic activity below the ground heats it up to hot tub temperature (or hotter/cooler, there was some variation). People have dug their own hot tubs all along the beach side. And just a \~2 hour drive away from Bend is one of my favorite national parks - Crater Lake.

Trump claims to be 6'3"" and 239 lbs. This height is clearly exaggerated and the real number is closer to 6'0"" or 6'1"". The weight is also closer to 250 or 260 based on pictures. 

I don't think that Putin's knee can support Trumps fat ass. Things are going to fall apart, kinda like Russian logistics are.

I put my estimate for Trumps weight based on a BMI visualizer. I think the visualizer assumes little to no muscular definition.

I'm appalled at the effects of Russian money in our elections and political campaigns. Sadly, we can't call the police to do anything about it now, we don't have that option.

Did Deripaska use the normal process for removing a squatter?

> The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

> After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

> * leave your property within 24 hours  
> * stay away from your property for 12 months

> To get final possession of the property, you must make a claim for possession.

No, they broke the door open and arrested them for trespass. So, actually, I'm more appalled that Russian Oligarchs who are sanctioned get more favourable treatment than British home-owners, who have to get a court IPO to have squatters removed.

6821,worldnews,Russian oligarch says he's 'appalled' by British police as squatters occupy London mansion for nearly 20 hours,JihadMeAtHello,1647346528.0,3251,52394,0.93,"**According to the Mueller Report Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was willing to give Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska private briefings while he worked for the 2016 election campaign. The report also states that Manafort was sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, though investigators couldn't determine why. The report outlines Kilimnik in contact with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, trying to resolve an issue involving Manafort owing a debt to Deripaska. The report goes on to state that the Russian oligarch wanted Manafort to advance Deripaska's interests in the event that Trump won the election. It should also be noted that following the election President Trump dropped sanctions on certain companies that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska's bottom line, though no direct link was established in the Mueller Report.**


*Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[1]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)*


>The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort **[redacted]** did not see a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

>...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, **[redacted].** Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 

>Gate's account about polling data is consistent **[redacted]** with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, **[redacted].**

>The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:

>> *I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.*

>> *Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]*

>Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.

**Furthermore, after being elected the Trump administration removed sanctions from Russian entities that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)**

>The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.

>...The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from¬†stray dog rescue¬†to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.

>The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal‚Äôs biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.

>And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.

>In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them ‚Äî in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.

>Notably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.

>...The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.

>Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.

>...Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.

>‚ÄúScore that a win for Putin,‚Äù¬†tweeted¬†Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.

>Get legal advice from a solicitor if you need help making a claim for possession.

You can only apply for an IPO if it‚Äôs been 28 days or less since you found out your property‚Äôs been squatted.

>Fill in an application for an IPO and send it to your local county court.

>The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

>After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

>leave your property within 24 hours
stay away from your property for 12 months

Then, he wants to act like he's the bigger person by ""Not getting drawn into this war.""

Except does that make any sense at all? Why on earth would Ukraine **want** to draw Belarus into attacking them? Ukraine isn't on the offensive here, they're fighting a purely defensive war, the **last** thing they want is to draw in a new attacker while also jeopardizing their global good will by committing an act of aggression. If they HAD long range missile capable of an attack like that, what possible reason would Ukraine have for launching them at Belarus, and not Russia, or the occupying Russian forces?

It does, however, make sense for *Russia* to have secretly fired that missile, especially if done from Ukrainian territory. Then, they can say they that not only are they such good allies of Belarus for helping stop this one missile, but that obviously Ukraine is a threat and they must join forces to stop them.

It's a classic False Flag attack, one of many we're likely to see from Russia as their position gets more and more tenuous.

> As a confirmation, just two days ago at night another Point-U missile was launched at the territory of our Belarus, which we together with Russians successfully intercepted and destroyed over Pripyat.

> The Ukrainian air defence system shot down a missile fired from the territory of Belarus in Kyiv.

 >Human mortality from H5N1 or the human fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 refer to the ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern due to the global spread of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia.

Some classics were dealt rough hands, As you mentioned Toy Story, When the 3rd movie came out and it ""ended"" I thought it would be great if they remastered the 1st in the style of the 3rd. 

We've seen it in games, a remaster of an old classic with a modern update. Some movies deserve that treatment.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

When the rose slowly bloomed in the studio splash screen, I let out a hefty chuckle because it seemed so retro and campy at the same time. I heard sneers from 2 rows behind us. My girlfriend was embarrassed after about 20 minutes when I was laughing so hard I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath. The movie audience of about 35 was completely silent but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn‚Äôt be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie. Sometimes I think my laughter just became so infectious because it was so cathartic and uproariously uncontainable. The movie would not be denied, I hadn‚Äôt laughed that hard for eons and when ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to‚Äù, that made it even funnier and more taboo - and even funnier.

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

It's so stupidly gory, and ridiculously funny, even in the final moments of its epic climax (spoiler: >!he fights a giant Kandarian demon in a tank and kills it by duct-taping the Kandarian dagger to the front of a tank shell and fires right into the demon's face, and the scene is exactly as funny as it sounds, complete with slapstick stupidity in a fucking tank!<).

Excited to rewatch the og series and remake as well. Personally, I love the extremely dark, violent, self-serious remake. Too bad we didn't get an Evil Dead 2 that kept the violence and gore and inserted the funny like Evil Dead II.

He was however, allowed to make a sequel. He elected to go ahead and film Evil Dead II as a remake and then tack 10 minutes of exposition on at the beginning to technically make it a sequel - so your method is pretty spot on for how it was intended to be watched.

Those ten minutes are the part he compromised to get it greenlit, everything else was all him. 

People tend to talk down Evil Dead but I think both are excellent, just different vibes.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90‚Äôs.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

And just look at The Fellowship of the Ring! That is a gory ass movie. Had the Orcs and Goblins been humans it would've been a hard R, but because they're fantasy creatures that bleed black it could be PG-13.",1647311622.0,98

This time, the crowd was way more into the comedic timing of it and was laughing at how serious the characters were treating the over the top absurdity of it.

Yeah, that's precisely my problem. The Marvel universe has a good number of geniuses, and apparently any of them can make something that competes with Peter's most iconic power. So why don't all the heroes have a smaller version? Clint can have web arrows, Steve can have a tether to his shield, and all of them can just toss out a little net to trip up enemies. Even if they aren't coordinated enough to swing, all of them would benefit from an easy to make net device. And we know it's easy to make, since Peter can do it out of a dumpster!

It also raises the problem of Peter's most iconic conflict -- he's poor as shit. But since these amazing webs can be made from common materials and it's just a matter of application, Peter can just patent a sticky net grenade or whatever and sell them as a nonlethal immobilizing tool to immediately solve his money problems forever. Think a can of silly string with more stopping power than bear mace, he'd make gangbusters.

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.  

ICU delirium significantly contributes to injuries in the hospital setting and increased length of hospitalization and can result in PTSD, depression, and personality and/or memory changes that persist after the hospitalization is over and delirium has resolved.",1647360852.0,11

Say what you will about some of the terminology used in this description of the ""pain body"" which really resonates with me, but in my experience, this has been useful.

A tl;dr version could be: hurt people hurt people (including themselves)

Or: misery loves company.

""
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, ‚Äúbecome you,‚Äù and live through you. It needs to get its ‚Äúfood‚Äù through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. 

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn‚Äôt really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane. 

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don‚Äôt face it, if you don‚Äôt bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn‚Äôt make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth ‚Äî that is, make it real in your own experience. 

So the pain-body doesn‚Äôt want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength.""",1647367015.0,1

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,6

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape. I can‚Äôt help but wonder why this is even an option when someone reports sexual assault, in the same way I wonder why so many men think stalking is a way to win a woman back.

In an era in which action against collective entities was discouraged among the general populace (e.g. a few hundred years ago), but action against individuals was encouraged (e.g. physical fights and duelings seen as legal), this might reverse.

Heck, it might even reverse in the USA less then 100 years ago when lynchings were de facto legal and unionization efforts scorned as communistic or otherwise un-American.

A good point brought up below was social media, which could be a societal reversion to a more balanced ability to act against both collective entities and individuals. OTOH social media also makes it easier for others to act against you, which might create a counter-balance away from individual enmity, as being hostile to an individual psychologically increases the thought that people will be hostile towards you.

Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick   
took over and our interest started to wane.",1647359676.0,4

I'm not sure if the character would have worked well in the lead. The movie they did was good enough, but weekly plots where Sam has to pull the weight of the narrative every time? Half the character's charm is that he scarcely ever gives a shit and is game for hijinks basically whenever, but a lead character has to be more invested than that.

Sam Axe has a constant ""I just wanna' go home"" energy whenever he's the focus of the plot, which is fantastic in short bursts, but wouldn't hold up to scrutiny in a spinoff where he's the perpetual focus. Character would have to change a lot to support it.",1647362283.0,4

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular. After all, NATO, the side with all this hyped-up 'dedicated platforms', still had a hell of a time avoiding losses to obsolete Soviet SAM systems over Yugoslavia",1647343051.0,1

US and NATO pilots tend to have an average of 200 flight hours per year, while Russian pilots only get somewhere between 60-100. The US and NATO pilots use that extra flight time to train on stuff like SEAD.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

At least some of the torpedo bombers had air cover. The problem was that the technique the USN was using at the time sucked.  
Some examples:   
The Enterprises fighter squadron VF-6 was providing cover for Hornets torpedo squadron VT-8 (VF-6 had lost the group of planes it was intended to cover and had basically 'latched' onto VF-8 instead). The issue was that the USN plan was to fly ""high cover"", so the USN fighters were high and the bombers were low, and as a result the USN fighters didn't do much (anything?) to interfere with the Zeros.  
When Enterprises torpedo squadron came in while VF-6 was still in the air and still ineffective.  
Yorktown's strike actually came in together, with the fighters (VF-3), bombers (VB-3) and torpedo aircraft (VT-3) arriving together. They went in as a single strike but one of the ways Japan had of dealing with their CAP being drawn away was keeping 'ready' aircraft on the decks which could be launched to respond to new threats, so by the time they came in the USN fighters were massively overmatched in number (6 USN fighters vs 40+ IJN fighters). VT-3 was also screwed in that they ran headfirst into the fighters chasing down the departing survivors of VT-6. 
  
> The Devastators drew the carrier's Zero cover downwards and they didn't have time to regain altitude when the other bombers arrived.  
  
VT-6 was also the only squadron that really had any effect at drawing the cover downwards, as they actually went in with other attacks. The other torpedo attacks were so early that there was plenty of time for the Japanese CAP to return to altitude. The idea of VT-8 (or VT-6) bravely sacrificing themselves to draw the CAP down is a myth that was created to try and pin a purpose to the slaughter of the torpedo squadron.",1647360789.0,2

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week. That is simply not enough to compete with NATO's level of training and barely enough to keep their pilots proficient. NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

Their operations in Syria mostly relied on unguided munitions. A lot of us assumed that it was just Russia not giving a shit. But looking at Ukraine it becomes obvious that when fighting someone with the right equipment, guided munitions is the difference between a successful strike from a jet at high altitude and missing your target with unguided bombs dropped from a low altitude, exposing you to both enemy fighters and MANPADs.

It's showing us that Russia has never really changed from the Soviet era. Most of their power comes from propaganda. They had the world convinced that Russia had near peer capabilities and tech. In reality their most recent hardware/tech is completely absent in a disastrous war that they're losing.

SFOD-A: A Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or ""A-Teams""). Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO, high altitude low opening), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.).

The movie [12 Strong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong) which is based on reporting by [Gary Schroen depicts their role either as forward observers, trainers, or other operational activities.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Schroen)

The CIA needed ODA teams on the ground to direct airstrikes. 12 strong illustrates roughly how that was done, including coordination with the CIA to bribe local warlords and removing MANPADS with large amounts of cash from Afghanistan.

SFOD-B: The ODB, or ""B-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11‚Äì13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field.

Note: Any time you read ""direct"", picture in your head shooting at the enemy. Direct fire = point and shoot. Indirect fire = artillery, mortars, fire from an unseen adversary.

SFOD-C: The SFODC, or ""C-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals, and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies.

SFOD-D: SFOD-D, or Delta Force is comprised of soldiers recruited from within the US Army's 75th Ranger's Regiment and the other occupational detachments. Strong focus on counter terrorism, clandestine operations. Generally works closely with the CIA's SAC/SOG.

Suffice it to say, Delta force are usually made up of former Green Berets. Functionally, due to the expected clandestine nature of their role they are separate but SFOD-A/B/C/D are all still under the command of JSOC and USSOCOM.

Russia tends to use much cheaper fixed radar arrays because they are cheaper for the effect. However, the USA uses directional radar arrays. These can be steered so that you can search for targets at all times or halted to focus on one key area. They are more expensive but also better as a result.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.

So, essentially as it moves away from the center of gravity (in this instance, think of it as the center of the star although it's a little bit off), it arcs quite slowly, but as it approaches the star it whips around.

Think of this orbit as kind of like a baseball field.  When you're going around the outfield, you're not turning that much in any one step, but as you come around home plate each step has a huge amount of arc in it.

If you draw a line through the middle of home plate, each side has 180 degrees. When you're near home plate, you can walk from one side around to the other in 2 or 3 steps. You've covered those 180 degrees in 2 or 3 seconds. 

Walking the same speed, it will take you what, 10 minutes? 20 minutes? to walk around down to third base, around the outfield, back down to first base, and back to home plate, completing the other 180 degrees and get back to where you started.

The end result of this is that for each degree of bend, when the object is in the outfield, it has many more steps to get across that degree, and so gravity out there, despite being weaker, has more time to act upon it.

With gravitational interactions there are 3 options, collision, escape, and orbit. If an object's speed is below the escape velocity at that distance then it will either collide with the larger body e.g. you on Earth's surface or it will orbit e.g planets/moons/satellites. Sedna is very far away so it must move relatively very slowly at that distance.

Everything is affected by everything.

The thing is, we just take it that something 'escapes' an orbit, but the assumption there is that gravity affects it by such a small amount that it's negligible. And of course, other larger objects affect a far away body much more.

But let's say there is only an earth and a moon in the universe, and the moon is flying away from Earth in an orbit that it's escaping. Given enough time, the moon will come back to earth.",1647354426.0,0
