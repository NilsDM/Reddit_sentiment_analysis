When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",1647302435.0,854

OK... it wasn't stolen. And it technically wasn't my first stick ever... I grew up on a farm where having access to stick was a norm so I'd been introduced to the concepts in a growing form (note that tractors and the sort have very different transmissions so don't match 1:1 with a car's tranny).

But the day that I learned to drive an actual stick, all on my own with no assistance, was when I was around 12. My dad was a truck driver who hauled cars. And I'd ride with him all the time to ""spend time"", or to just travel. Like if I was going to visit him in Florida for the summer, I'd ride in the truck rather than fly.

Well he was moving a porsche down for a friend of a friend on heavy discount as a favor. And the guy was being a total dick bag about it and was going to stiff my pops on the money because he thought he could get away with it due to the relationship that tied the 2 together (lets just say my dad was in some unsavory side business back when he was alive).

So my dad was going to have to eat the loss on this one.

Well, while sitting in the palm beach auto auction where he was unloading the rest of his load. He tossed me the keys to the porsche and said:

""I think it's about time you learn to drive stick.""

For 2 hours I drove around that auto auction lighting that clutch on fire!

Exactly that. If you have nothing that's interesting about you, you gotta tell people that you can drive a manual transmission. And it's funny how these people often don't realize how ridiculous they sound when they explain it to people who use their car to get from A to B.

Here in Germany, people are still very fond of manual transmissions. Just a few years ago more than 50% of new registrations still were cars with manual transmissions.

Trouble is most people are hard on them, so you constantly run into people who replace a clutch every 30-60k like it's routine maintenance, to the point where tons of people will tell you that it is routine maintenance and that you should expect it every 60-100k or whatever. In my experience it's usually the people who hill hold and the people who constantly rest their foot against the clutch when they're not shifting. Hill holding is absolutely awful for your clutch and is a bandaid for people's inability to do hill starts without rolling back, and the foot resting there often turns into slightly riding the clutch 100% of the time without noticing. Lot of people also constantly rest their hand on the shifter (I call it Vin Dieseling) which tends to cause unnecessary synchro wear.

That's not the only reason valets are used.   

Some times the parking lot is small and you can't fit all the cars into the spaces (i.e. cars need to be blocked in).   In those cases a valet has access to all the cars keys, and can move cars as needed to get them in and out.

Other times valets have specific lots they have access to as well for parking cars.

Sometimes it's simply convenience rather than laziness.   You're at a hotel, you're checking in, you have bags.

The program began in 1991 and still isn't fully successful but hit a plateau in 2015. Nearly 25 years to fight a very regional parasite that is very easy to prevent. The estimated cost of the entire program is $350 million.

There is scope for improving some people‚Äôs live through charitable work, but it is far more effective to increase global wealth by efficiently allocating capital. If you take away 10% of billionaire‚Äôs capital invested in productive industries/companies/assets etc. and instead of allocating it to wealth-maximising enterprises you inefficiently allocate it you would likely end up with a net negative effect on global wealth. We can also argue about how taking away capital from productive entreprises and allocating them to charitable causes which in effect increase consumption would have an inflationary effect that would undermine the value of the donation (simply - less production, more consumption, ie, more mouths chasing less bread). 1.3T is a drop in the bucket though so the effect is likely not to be that large, but at a larger scale these are issues you need to consider.

https://lppapers.substack.com/p/lp-14-intellectual-property-a-policy

> Patents, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property play an enormously important and underappreciated role in the economy. Intellectual property may plausibly raise the cost of the affected items by more than $1 trillion annually over the free market price. This is roughly half of all pre-tax corporate profits. It also is a major factor in the upward redistribution of income over the last four decades, with the big winners including some of the country‚Äôs richest people. In other words, it is a big deal.

http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm

>  It is common to argue that intellectual property in the form of copyright and patent is necessary for the innovation and creation of ideas and inventions such as machines, drugs, computer software, books, music, literature and movies. In fact intellectual property is a government grant of a costly and dangerous private monopoly over ideas. We show through theory and example that intellectual monopoly is not necessary for innovation and as a practical matter is damaging to growth, prosperity and liberty.",1647341929.0,1

A billionaire is a person who has inordinate wealth. More than they could ever need. Their wealth is multiplying at a record breaking pace.

But a billionaire can find the money for their new superyacht?

(my opinion + what I have learned in a none academic setting)

Planning and means to execute on plan is a good indication of suicide been seriously concerned. 

If you have selected a time for when and plan on how to do it and have got the prerequisite to execute your plan. 
Then you should really get emergency psychiatric attention.

Often times suicides are well planned orchestrated affairs where things may in some cases planned to the smallest detail. The higher the resolution/ clarity of the plan the more urgent it is to get help.


Example of a plan with some resolution: 

I want to die in 7 days after doing X at 09:00 hours using a tree and a rope. I have got the rope and a nice spot to do it, before I go I want to enjoy the morning sun and get my affairs in order.

:example end 

Also pre suicide attempt you may see some slight change that maybe interpreted as positive or negative, it‚Äôs very much personal and may not occur at all in some individuals. 
Either way if you see changes in a friend or family, it will most likely not going to hurt to ask if they are doing well. 

Some may lie and say they are fine, but it‚Äôs very individualistic what you should do to help that person. my personal opinion is to call for professional assistance if you feel like you need help helping someone.

This is all my opinion and experiences + what I have been told from friends that deal with this professionally. If anyone wants to correct or add to this please do so.",1647333011.0,20

EDIT: There are a lot of replies about the ER doctor being called an idiot, so let me clarify. Firstly, the Neurologist called him an idiot, not me. I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests.

First time I just went to the hospital.  I told them I thought I was having a heart attack and they took that very seriously. 

Shortly after they were like ""Uh, looks like you're fine."" 

I got some tests done on my heart health to be extra sure, and turned out my heart was fine.  

But what was causing it was alcohol.  Apparently drinking can suppress your ""fight or flight"" response and when you sober up it goes into overdrive.  Never experienced it before, but once I understood what was going on I noticed anytime I drank enough to get drunk, it would happen the next day.  So I just stopped drinking.

I think over time, the ER has become the place to go for quick care when you can‚Äôt wait or can‚Äôt tolerate your complaint, I.E. back pain, dental pain, etc. 

Ultimately the goal is to rule out life threatening emergencies and at the end of your ER visit you are: 1.) stable enough for discharge, 2.) being admitted for one or more reasons that require additional observation, or 3.) being transferred to a facility with higher level of care (for example: a level one trauma center, a burn center, or a behavioral-psychiatric facility). That isn‚Äôt to say that your vertigo is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and more often than not, patients are told to follow up with their primary care physicians or a specialist. Unfortunately, in your case, patients presenting with dizziness will get a cardiac/neuro work up which usually include but are not limited to: an EKG, IV and subsequent bloodwork, IV fluids, medication to reduce the dizziness, and maybe a CT of the head. If you present with ‚Äúvertigo‚Äù then you are already diagnosed with vertigo and there is very little they can do other than medicate you or keep you for observation (which conveniently isn‚Äôt covered by most U.S. health insurance plans as ‚Äòobservation‚Äô is not considered ‚Äòadmission‚Äô) and you‚Äôll be sacked with thousands in medical bills. 

I‚Äôm really sorry you had a bad experience. Don‚Äôt give up on our healthcare system, it‚Äôs not built for exceptional, efficient care, it‚Äôs built to make a few people exuberant amounts of money. The whole process from calling 911 to discharge is a massive business that has undermined the entire system and alienated even the most empathetic healthcare workers. But we‚Äôre still here, and we‚Äôre still trying to do the best we can with what we have. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs the patients that bear the biggest burden.",1647336735.0,8

I mean, I sure wouldn't know what to say and I'm sure a lot of people are like that. Wanting to end your own life is so profoundly alien to us who have never experienced it that you just can't react to it.

Now, brushing it off is the selfish thing to do though. You can absolutely give it a ""not my responsibility"" approach and recommend seeing a professional immediately, but saying ""bro, it's gonna be ok, just take a walk"" or ""but other have it much worse than you, think of all the things you can be grateful for"" is bad.

If someone's car makes a weird noise and you have no idea what it is, you don't recommend them to ""turn up the music so you don't hear it and it'll go away"" but neither do you attempt to fix it unless you know what you're doing. If someone told me they were considering taking their own life, I wouldn't dare say anything, as I have NO IDEA if it would be good or it would push them over the edge.

To everyone in this situation, the best honest thing to say if you can't relate is ""I'm sorry you're going through this. You should seek professional help immediately, this is serious.""",1647339723.0,1

When I told him about h pylori (and the associated Nobel prize for medicine) he typed it into his doctors google thing and then said ""oh yeah"" and ordered a blood test...

GPs should really be under some kind of obligation to keep up to date with advancements in medicine. Obviously they can't be expected to learn *every* new thing, but you'd think if it was important enough to earn a Nobel prize that my doctor would have at least heard of it.

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I‚Äôd been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I‚Äôd been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

I walk back inside and one of her friends approached me and told me if I told her, the friend, that I never wanted to see or talk to my ex again she would let me leave. I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving. 
This all happened after she did the following.
1) called me hundreds of times from a dozen numbers to which I blocked and requested she doesn‚Äôt call
2) egged new girlfriends car
3) tried to get me to do threesome
4) tried to make me fuck buddies
5) asked a very desperate friend of mine to prom hoping to get in our group
6) followed me to work, home

Two years later, I have a new phone number and am I‚Äôm college. I get a call and answer it. It‚Äôs her. No idea how she found me. She asked if I went to the local university to which I replied yes. I did not actually go there, I went to a state college. She enrolled in that university.

But the ex said she was going with her kids (we didn‚Äôt live together, obviously) to stay at a resort (live in LV) when in fact she was staying at NYNY casino with a truck driver. Said driver got extremely drunk and belligerent the next morning/afternoon and she clearly must have too, because she ended up passing out in his truck cab that evening as he in a rage withheld her phone from her. He evidently discovered the phone video of me and her doing the deed and proceeded to post it on her FB page. 
I started to get texts/ calls around 7pm from friends, then her close friends. Was insanely embarrassing and heartbreaking at the same time. I was in a bar within the hour trying to calm down. 

Since said video was not (because of the angle) breaking any FB decency rules and her being passed out, it took until 10-11am the next day before it was removed. By that time her ex husband (yeah, bizarre) already had a missing persons report with the police. Everyone from her hometown was bugging him and me (most thought I posted it, at first) as to where TF she was. 

Cops had to come to me at the casino I work at and ask me if I wanted to press charges‚Ä¶ of course I didn‚Äôt.

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum). Incredibly sad that he doesn't understand/doesn't get it and may never get it for years, if at all.",1647315384.0,18

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren‚Äôt appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don‚Äôt we spend more time with them, why don‚Äôt we go out more, why don‚Äôt we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don‚Äôt do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven‚Äôt done it yet, I probably won‚Äôt ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,68

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"". 

I knew she probably said it out of courtesy, but it was just enough for me to never do it again.",1647289453.0,21

My ex died last August from a drug overdose in the woods. Well honestly in an empty lot next to a construction site. It was egregious and terrible and brutal for him, and not the way any human being should be photographed by police or remembered by their parents. 

Was it a drug overdose as suicide? Was it a garden variety drug overdose? I think there's a 90% chance it was overdose as suicide, his mother doesn't feel that and I would never try to change her mind. 

Regardless of the method though, even if it had been some magical peaceful method (and you know it's a cruel joke that mother nature makes damn sure it's impossible to kill ourselves peacefully) it wasn't about the photographs or what his mother had to see. 

It was the fact her child was taken from her. Adult child but still her son. The people we are put here in the world to love beyond all reason and protect and guide into the future beyond us. It breaks a person. 

She thinks about him everyday. She hurts everyday. I check in on her occasionally and we touch base. There's not going to be a day that goes by in her life that she doesn't think of her dead son. And there have been a very few days between August and today that I haven't thought about him. 

Even though I have an extremely demanding life and a child and so many responsibilities I can't get everything done. 

None of that obviates what someone meant to you, and what they took away when they left.

Understand this. An accident outdoors is believable and means your family and friends will be sad but nobody thinks of suicide. That is important because if they did, the pain is much worse and goes on for decades.

The risk as you say is remaining alive with a broken body. People do not always die in a fall which makes this a problem.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1107

Of course that meant I was emotionally unavailable and and she held on for a while but but then moved on.   I did the work on myself and learned how to be vulnerable, but now she's happy with somebody else.   And as much as I want her to choose me I want her to be happy, even if that means without me.    And the problem with this is now I can't go back to the way I was before no matter how hard I try.",1647294137.0,19

I think it's just that kids today socialize differently when they're between 10-15. It IS sad from my perspective but my perspective doesnt matter to them - and it shouldnt. They experience things we never did, that will define their childhoods (Roblox, VR Chat with their friends etc) and I guess Im just not willing to play the grumpy old ""back in my day"" type. Things change and have always done so.

I have a 3 year old and honestly, his age up until say 8-10, kids play outside for sure. Basketball, pokemon Go:ing, soccer etc. Not as much as we did, but we didnt have an option. But when they get a bit older and are more into socializing with their friends beyond just playing, the internet experience is their place.

Would the tree grow as your playing the game, starts as a sapling and you finish the game as an old growth? Character growth‚Ä¶

Could you incorporate other species of trees? Or maybe a deciduous and an evergreen to start with. Each could have the traits of those trees in nature..

Maybe incorporate something like the mountain pine beetle as an adversary, once it attacks and lays its eggs it‚Äôs a long slow death kinda thing‚Ä¶

I see a whole bunch of suggestions here, which seem way too premature for the state the game's in.

If you can, I'd love to see a dissolve or rot effect added to the roots as they disappear rather than it just blanking out in chunks. 

Reactions from the humans being smacked would also not go amiss. Some minor stumble or shake, anything to lead credence to there having been an impact.

I don't mind the backhoe exploding as it does, but if you can't destroy the stone building in one pass you shouldn't be able to walk through it doing passive damage. You should bounce off, while doing damage to the structure at that point. With smacks or stomps doing damage in an AoE in front of you by comparison.

And yes, as other people pointed out, if the humans can take more than one hit, the equipment should be a bit tougher too unless you have some kind of special ability to entangle them with roots. Nature beats jenga tower technology after all.",1647314195.0,1

The concept is very cool, but you can probably see how it could feel pretty lethargic to play. Movement speed is very low. It's fine for the identity of the player but if they have to traverse long sections it will become frustrating. The swing of the hand is very unsatisfying. The acceleration curve could use some tweaking to make the peak speed of the attack faster. You also more or less must add more screen shake and extra effects like bright flashes to make it more juicy.

Thoughts:

*End of level, main character plants itself into ground and blooms, grows leaves. The less damage you took, the greater the bloom.  

*collect bird nests and small animals (eg squirrels) as bonuses. They can help you fight.

*weather effects? Wind, snow, rain, lightning. 

*have a move where you can plant your roots deep. It limits movement, exposing you to danger, but allows for unique powerful attacks. 

*Maybe a stealth level where you can hide motionless until humans pass? 

*I‚Äôd love to see some unique environment interactions like walking through electrical wires and they break and drop with sparks, crossing a busy road and cars are swerving out of the way, jumping in a river (floating?)

*Finale in a giant lumbar mill with huge saws, wood chippers, and the like. Basically a horror movie for trees. Maybe the player has to free all the trees about to get cut up?",1647312559.0,2

> I'm currently still playing with the level of destruction per element. But I'll take your feedback into account, thank you once again! :)

I used to work as a welder repairing heavy equipment. Excavators like that are massively overbuilt which is why they move so slow and why they need caterpillar tracks to support their weight. The boom arm is usually 3/8- 1/2 (13mm) thick steel plate of very high strength steel, premium quality stuff. It's a pain to weld because you have to preheat it to prevent the welds from cracking if they cool too quickly, because the structure is so rigid. Operators abuse the hell out of those things so they make them literally bulletproof. Can be up to 50mm/2"" around the pivot pins. Operators sometimes use the arm to drag the entire weight of the machine up a muddy slope. They're also of course rigorously designed not to catch on fire. You can guarantee somone somehere has unintentionally gone out of their way to try setting them on fire. See-Murphys Law.

So I feel like the best tactic in this scenario would be to flip the machine on it's side, or else attack the cab side and come at the driver, ""I am groot"" style. It's not just going to blow away in the breeze. You could just trigger a cracked glass image and some blood spatter on the windows. 

Probably one of the few objects in game that's should be deliberately non destructible. 

Another fun game mechanic might be keeping other creepers from climbing up into the cab and starting it up again. I'm envisioning a boss-fight scenario here where you play king of the hill.

They arent meant to keep inside. Only time thats ok is for rehabilitation or rescue of an injured animal. They are meant to be wild. 

I love animals and the best way to show that, is to let wild animals remain wild and enjoy them in their natural habitat. 

FYI: Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other forms of direct contact with infected squirrels. Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid. Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease, Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. - googled information.",1647282736.0,10

If your definition of Rock and Roll is Chuck Berry, you might be surprised by the Beatles ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", even though they were big fans of Chuck Berry.  If your definition of Rock and Roll is the Beatles, you might be surprised by funk emerging in the 70s.  (Actually I remember this discussion coming up separately on reddit once, of whether or not funk is rock.  To me it is, at least...)  If your definition is funk, you'll be surprised by New Wave.  If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

If I were to try to define Rock and Roll, maybe some of the key features are that it is loud and features guitars, but neither of these things are actually essential.  I agree intuitively that many of the people on this list aren't really Rock artists, but I have no idea where the line is anyway.",1647290713.0,3

Hell, a lot of those early soul groups got their start as doo wop groups like the Miracles and Marvin Gaye started as doo wop artists. Otis Redding even took a lot of influence from and began as a Little Richard imitator and if you listen to some slower Little Richard songs like Send Me Some Lovin' it sounds like soul.

For those unaware, as Cash got popular, he was invited to play a private show for president Nixon and other high profile members of society. 

The Nixon admin thought it‚Äôd be a safe bet, because he played old boy, country music and wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about all the anti-war criticism being leveled at him at the time for Vietnam. Nixon hated the hippies and their anti-war sensibilities, so getting a show by good ol country boy Johnny Cash should have been a safe bet. 

So what does Cash do? Writes an anti-war song criticizing the elite called ‚Äúwhat is truth‚Äù (banger song btw) and plays it at the show, right in front of Nixon, as the closer.

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that. Duplantier's ability to shift from growls to clean vocals offers interesting interplay with Parton's high, gentle voice and his solid groove in his rhythm playing would provide a great drive.",1647314465.0,1

There's a reason why Shania Twain and Clay Aiken aren't still pumping out at least passable good music, but Madonna is. Madonna works with the best. Always. Fresh, new, new sounds, beautiful tracks. It's possible for Dolly, and even a Britney Spears, if they get a fresh new crew. Honestly, I'd only trust Madonna to manage teams for older stars, as odd as that is to say. She's has the best track record and longevity and an uncanny ear for the next new sound under her belt. She can hear or see something totally new and just know how it will work.

Dolly re-did Old Flames beautifully with Keshsa on her ""I'm a real artist"" album. Jack White blew his pud on Loretta Lynn. I would suggest someone who still has a fight in their belly. A great writer and lover of Dolly. The writer would have to know her, and still have a fight. As risky as this sounds, I'd hire Diane Warren to co-write, and Madonna to produce.

They would rent out consoles, and if you asked and they had spare, you could buy a used one. that thing never quit on me. It introduced me to a whole new world of RPGs. Legend of Dragoon is a fond one, Parasite Eve was scary for me. 

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

What‚Äôs crazy is how going to rent a movie or video game was a common occurrence for pretty much my whole life up until 10 years or so ago.

6258,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,517,11446,0.95,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

[http://www.walkscore.com](http://www.walkscore.com)

However, Downtown Houston and particularly Downtown Dallas both have pretty good walking scores. Downtown Dallas was a bunch of deserted office skyscrapers when I lived there but I hear it has gotten better.

EDIT: Since people are getting confused, Houston and Dallas being ranked 24th and 26th walkability score of large American cities is a VERY BAD ranking. The website is saying that Dallas and Houston are car dependent and UNWALKABLE. So everyone replying saying, ""That website is wrong! Houston and Dallas are terrible to walk!"" Yes, that's exactly what the website is also saying. The ""downtown"" neighborhoods that have decent walk scores are pretty small areas of both Dallas and Houston which are only a handful of blocks large.

I live in a pretty liberal city in Oregon.  But middle and upperclass neighborhoods are often a little segregated between liberal and conservative.   The liberal neighborhoods are in the hills, deep in the trees, 1500-4000 sqft houses, big yards with gardens and signs welcoming people from all walks of life, walking paths that meander through the forest, etc.  

The conservative neighborhoods are on the flats, cookie cutter houses 2500-5000 sqft, packed so closely together that you could open a window and reach out to touch another house.

Then it's 100¬∞+ in the shade everyday for like 5 months. They get a winter now though for maybe a month which they are still not prepared; no infrastructure really and stores don't stock much for ice removal or anything like that. 

During the freeze last year we were standing in line to cut up untreated lumber to burn, for the few that could skid down the road to the lowes. I think we were out of propane too. I found one small tank and used a blow torch to defrost drain pipes. You have to drip faucets all winter so they don't freeze but during the power outage, that froze up the drains. 

Anyway, we're closing on our house there soon hopefully and already left for good. The power outage and the following pipe bursts was the final straw on an already broken back.

My experience with transit has varied based on where I have lived, but I've always been within walking distance of a grocery store. I specifically have chosen where to live based on proximity to a grocery store and access to transit, and it's not necessarily expensive. In 2017-18 I was in fort worth walking distance from a grocery store and transit hub, and 2018-2021 I was in Houston near a variety of frequent bus routes and walking distance to a grocery store, as well as multiple restaurants and shops. My rent in fort worth was $699 and in Houston $799, both for a one bedroom between 600-800 square feet. 

But I have also always explicitly made the choice for those amenities. Back in 2017 I specifically sought out a work from home job, and have been working from home ever since. I always check transit access for places I'm moving to, and make sure that the transit connects to where I'd want to go for things like recreation, errands, and shopping. I got a folding bike in order to be able to easily take my bike on trains and extend the area I could easily access from transit. I make very frequent trips to the grocery store, about 2-3 times per week, each trip usually being about 30 minutes round trip if I'm dallying, since I have to carry everything home myself. I accept that trips themselves take longer and plan accordingly (though I have way more usable time than if I drove everywhere). 

I know not everyone could live my lifestyle, or even want to. I know my experience is not the norm. But I wanted a car free lifestyle while still living in Texas cities. I've been able to achieve that and am very content with my lifestyle.",1647317729.0,3

Texas is huge. And most people in Texas likes to think that their slice of Texas is the best version of Texas, from Austin to hill country to ranch towns in west Texas. Which means every Texan outside of [insert Texan city] can't agree on who's best, but they can agree to throw shade on that city (unless they're actually from that city).

My take: Dallas represents Texas just fine. It's a huge metro with great variety and diversity inside it. And yes: it's sprawling.

When I use your drive through, you don't have your menu visible anywhere until literally the second that I start ordering. You have a big TV screen earlier on in the line that you use for a bunch of advertisement bullshit instead of displaying the menu. Then you have a big TV screen next to your intercom, and you have fucking ads or the last guy's order displayed on it until the very last second. It doesn't switch over to displaying your menu until the moment the intercom guy asks me what I want, and sometimes it's a few seconds after that.

Anyway, I had to come up with the messages and my night maintenance guy changed the letters on the sign for me. He hated the sign more than all of us combined.

About your boat envy; some things to consider...

There is generally an inverse relationship between the size of the boat and your bank account balance.

sweet summer child. that is just so not true.

wait until i tell you about the US invading Vietnam...

or iraq....or wherever

totally justified and well done /s

we're not so different. i mean our nation *started out* with the genocide of an entire continent of peoples... and then the subjugation of black people for hundreds of years after that...sooooo... the US doesn't have a good track record when it comes to human atrocities. sure, we're better now, although are we really?

although in this case with russia and ukraine it's a bit over the top evil for no real reason. well for money. same reason the US actually invaded vietnam, or afghanistan, or iran, etc. it's all about money/oil. in general the USA is no better than any other place when it comes to greed like that.

it's not like US soldiers haven't knowingly murdered innocent people across the sea, and then got pardoned by trump for murdering innocent women and children on purpose just cuz the soldiers wanted to have some ""fun."" and those are just the ones that got charged. that shit happens way too often.

In fact, the US is generally one of the worst in the whole world. That's why so many other countries hate the US. Because the US exploits them afar, to gain benefits at home. most countries/people's are justified in their hate of america.

the people of russia not so much though. they have very little reason to hate america. at least until putin started a war which caused america/the west to cut ties. now the people are getting upset. which is the point.",1647327406.0,5

With what money you ask?

The funny thing about communism is that there was a shadow capitalist system the whole time, with people trading favours to arbitrage the centralised planning. This was horrendously illegal and people doing it risked their lives, however some became truly wealthy.

Enforcement of the trades was done outside the legal system, much like the drug industry today - with brutal violence.

Then you clearly aren't paying attention, at all. No offense but even mainstream media sources have been discussing this problem. 

On both the far left and far right, there are sympathizers with Russia, albiet for entirely different reasons. Far left supporters, usually just called tankies, essentially support Russia and China on the basis of their belief that the Western hegemon must be destroyed at all costs. Far right support is a lot more complicated and ties into an entire web of shady propaganda operations that I'm not gonna write an essay about here. Needless to say, many Republicans are pretty invested in Russia for a variety of reasons and that's reflected in some elements of their voting base.

Its not something you build once and then just plop it into the ground for a few years an expect it to still work.
Given what shit show we are seeing now, if an order was given:

1) How many people would follow it?

2) Of those that did how many missiles would launch vs just sit there doing nothing?

3) Of those that attempted to launch, how many would blow up in the tubes?

4) Of those that cleared the tubes how many would make orbit?

5) Of those that made orbit how many would track to the actual target?

6) Of those that start tracking to target how many would get through the missile shields?

7) Of those that made it through the shields, how many would properly detonate?


Not saying these are things that we really want to test.... But its probably a very different situation than it would have been at the height of the cold war when these things were new, and ""may"" have actually been maintained to some degree.

Putin has got his hands dirty on multiple occasions over the past 10 years - he doesn't just make idle threats.

Regardless of the state of the Russian nuclear arsenal you can be pretty damn sure that some of those missiles will get through. 

Maybe it wouldn't be a complete apocalypse (in the West), but tell that to the millions of dead people London, New York, Washington, Paris, Berlin and all the other major US and European cities that no doubt have multiple Russian warheads targeted at them. 

Tell that to all the Russians who will undoubtedly die when the US/Europeans retaliate with a full strike (which will probably be triggered automatically if the Russians even look like they are going ballistic).

Tell that to the billions who will then probably die as a result of a global collapse in supply chains, potential nuclear winter and nuclear fallout.

*  We know Putin has a track record of following through with threats
*  We know Putin is in his 70's (he is already older than the average life expectancy of most Russian men)
*  We know that Putin is increasingly paranoid
*  We know that Putin will do anything to 'restore Russian pride' and has a hard-on for taking the US down a peg or two.

You really want to fucking gamble that Putin will not start a nuclear war at the potential cost of a completely fucked up world?

Maybe 75% of his nukes will malfunction, maybe some of the 'yes-men' he has put in place over the past 20 years will grow some balls and not go along with the plan, maybe God will save us - who the fuck knows, but I would certainly not be willing to gamble millions/potentially billions of lives when Russia will probably self-destruct on its own shortly anyway.

additionally anti-cruise and ballistic missile capability is much harder than you‚Äôd think.  short range interceptors, ie thaad systems and iron dome interceptors, are much too short range and payloads can still seriously affect target areas.  medium and long range interceptors (abms) have hit rates varying between 50-70% in tests.  meaning we‚Äôve gotta fire 4 for every 1 missile to guarantee disabling it.  we don‚Äôt have that many abms, especially considering mixing in non nuclear payloads in a strike.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

When the rose slowly bloomed in the studio splash screen, I let out a hefty chuckle because it seemed so retro and campy at the same time. I heard sneers from 2 rows behind us. My girlfriend was embarrassed after about 20 minutes when I was laughing so hard I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath. The movie audience of about 35 was completely silent but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn‚Äôt be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie. Sometimes I think my laughter just became so infectious because it was so cathartic and uproariously uncontainable. The movie would not be denied, I hadn‚Äôt laughed that hard for eons and when ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to‚Äù, that made it even funnier and more taboo - and even funnier. Damn it, that little film was so clever and raw and manic and goofy and terrifying it will always hold a special place in my heart.

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90‚Äôs.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

And just look at The Fellowship of the Ring! That is a gory ass movie. Had the Orcs and Goblins been humans it would've been a hard R, but because they're fantasy creatures that bleed black it could be PG-13.",1647311622.0,76

There‚Äôs horror all over the series. The books are very scary. Mordor and Sauron‚Äôs primary power is literal terror. 

What other kind of director can showcase an ‚Äúinanimate object‚Äù negatively affecting everyone and everything around it? To give you a sense of fear and dread up front of what it would mean to the world if this power was unleashed. 

There are so many epic heroic moments. They all stand on the foundation of confronting and facing the terror. To be a literal little person in a big world and stand up to the evil.

It‚Äôs beautifully animated, but the story is weak and kind of nonsensical. The music is alright, most of the songs are pretty catchy (‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Talk About Bruno‚Äù is overrated AF, and the best song is the one She-Hulk sings), but mostly sound like generic pop music with a radio-friendly structure and sound rather than a theatrical/movie musical structure and sound. The lyrics can get clumsily busy, and I really wanted to hear a soundtrack/score that sounds more Latin American than what was ultimately offered. There‚Äôs only a few hints of Latin Jazz, Cumbia, and Habanera here and there. The music just comes across as generic and easily replaced, most of it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs part of the movie. 

   There‚Äôs also so many characters in this movie with the writers trying to fully flesh out each one, but it falls flat in a movie made for the attention span of children.  Seriously, there are so many characters it‚Äôs impossible to remember all their names unless you‚Äôve seen the movie multiple times. The only name I can remember is Bruno, and only because his name is in a song title. Had to come up with nicknames for them that either describe their powers or their relationships to other characters, like Animal Boy, Brown Poison Ivy, Batgirl, ADHD Nightcrawler, the aforementioned She-Hulk, Narcissistic Grandma, Main Girl, Animal Boy‚Äôs Dad, etc. The only character you can remember the name of is the one we‚Äôre not allowed to say. 

I know Encanto is a strictly Disney Film and not a Disney Pixar film like Coco, but Coco is far superior  (faaaaaaarrrrrrrrr superior) when it comes to a movie about Latin America, the people who live there, and the importance of family. The plot isn‚Äôt muddled and anti-climactic, the music actually feels like it belongs in the movie, and there‚Äôs still a large cast of characters, but they‚Äôre handled appropriately: you can remember the names of all the characters important to driving the plot, and the rest of the cast is mostly there for support, comic levity, and variety of voices delivering incidental lines.

Also Coco made me cry and want to see it again, and I finished Encanto feeling neutral and uninterested.",1647334879.0,2

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,26

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

WRONG...

EDIT:

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,73

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

I've got a friend, initials DID, who grew up in a trailer park to first gen Trinidadian immigrant parents who speak with heavy accents, so zero privilege. In 5th grade, DID's teacher thinks he's pretty smart and he should do an international baccalaureate (IB) preparedness program at a magnet middle school (harder middle school classes to prepare for harder high school classes). DID convinced his parents to sign the forms, which they only do because the school is a magnet program so he'll be added to a bus route and they won't have to take him to the miles further away middle school.  
  
During 8th grade, DID does all the paperwork himself to get into magnet high school with the IB program. DID excels in the IB program and gets into the nearby state university (now a top 10 public university) on a variety of scholarships and grants, which he researched and applied for all by himself. Never received any financial help from any family members.  
  
At the University, DID meets eventual wife, who is premed. Travels around the country with her for med school and residency. Works at several advertising firms along the way. After residency, moves to Jacksonville, FL where wife takes job at one of the hospitals and DID founds his own online advertising firm. Now DID makes like $300k/year and his Dr wife makes more and they live in a huge house like 6 blocks from the beach.  
  
That covers the work ethic and up by his bootstraps point. Now the natural intelligence.  
  
DID has 4 siblings. They're all short sighted, immediate gratitude, poor decision making, in their 40s and still working menial jobs BUT as far as I know (known DID since 6th grade) not on drugs or with criminal records (so it isn't like they got into the system early and had additional barriers). The only one who doesn't live in a trailer park near the parents, check to check, is one sister who married her HS boyfriend who eventually became a Ford dealership manager after working there like 20 years and lives a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  
  
Those 5 people grew up in the same home, all born in the USA, none had noticeable accents, and all went to the same schools outside of DID choosing basically on his own to go to the two magnet programs. All of his siblings suffer from dumb people issues like lack of logic and inability to prepare for the future. The only explanation is DID being naturally smarter than his siblings.",1647305935.0,1

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems?

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,6

It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high.

The other study was modern data and you dismissed that.

The other study sucked, for obvious reasons which I explained at length. It's not my fault that the first study was so poorly done, nor that the second study is over two decades old. That's historical data at this point, not a current representation of either the US or Germany's status in 2022.

This last article you linked to (Stockhausen) is the only decent one among the three. It seems to analyze relevant data, although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. It's not nothing, but it's also not very much in absolute terms.

Oddly, the abstract claims that, ""while the majority of German males has been able to share in the country‚Äôs rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground."" However, this is directly contradicted by the results themselves, which clearly indicate that well over half of American men earn more than their fathers. The majority of both American and German men are doing better than their fathers.

 Notably, this study does not evaluate the amount of improvement per individual (i.e. only the number of people who earn more, not how much more they earn), nor does it address the downward mobility included in the original study which started this thread.

Altogether, I would have to say that the results do not make a compelling case for any sort of policy guidance.",1647313173.0,16

They missed things like a much lower wealth disparity between the richest and poorest, meaning that there are fewer wealth-based barriers to moving between economic strata. Combined with some of the things they *did* mention, like free education, health care and parental leave, it becomes *much* easier to re-train, re-educate or simply re-align your career and lifestyle.

It didn‚Äôt. Your reasons were bad.

Income mobility is, by definition, a measure of parent to child. It must, therefore, span many decades. Generally at least 5 decades, often 6- enough time for the parents earnings to be captured over time, to start. Then for the child to become an adult, and then that adult child to now have a long period of adult earnings to be averaged over time and compared to the averaged over time earnings of the parent.

And it must have good data about both parent, and child, and they must be comparable.

Can you think of Any reason, any at all, why they would predominant use the data of fathers‚Ä¶ from 50-60 years ago?

And not mothers? In the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs? Any reason at all that data about women‚Äôs the earnings, in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, might not be great for analysis of societal income mobility?


>nor that the second study is over two decades old. 

Again, these studies must, by definition, span close to half a century. There is no evidence that these types of massive country level trends change quickly.

>although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). 

Does it?

Really?

Give this a good think.

>The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. 

That‚Äôs a huge difference.

That also means 40% earn less. Vs 33%.

Swinging 7% of the population from going down to going up means that the amount of income from that 7% is ripped from the hands of the Very top tiers- it can come from nowhere else- and redistributed to the working class.

That‚Äôs an enormous amount of overall income / GDP that is more evenly distributed to citizens.

If you think it‚Äôs so little, then let‚Äôs have the US copy Germany‚Äôs much higher taxes and social welfare policies, to drive exactly that outcome.

That‚Äôs fine, right?",1647313928.0,-2

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week. That is simply not enough to compete with NATO's level of training and barely enough to keep their pilots proficient. NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this. It has a much better system for target indentification and radar so the plan is to feed information from it to other systems so that the F-35 does all of the guidance and the actual missile systems and aircraft never really show up to the enemy.",1647333355.0,7

The entire premise of what you are trying to say is completely incorrect. The rise of Boomer's also coincides with the rise of the counterculture and the backlash against conservative figures. Boomers are the reason why art from the mid 60s to early 70s is still held in such high regard, because things that were more risky and broke social conventions were particularly marketable and popular amongst young people. 

Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, John Wayne and so on are all figures that are really held up by the generation before. I know you said (when boomers were growing up) but Boomer culture hadn't come into it's own at this point and these figures weren't being marketed towards boomers, so they weren't for boomers.

I might point you towards the biggest figures amongst Boomers who were absolutely not fascist pricks and are still some of the most respected figures in all of art/society. Bob Dylan, McCartney, Lennon, Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Jim Morrison are really their most famous musicians and very much not fascists. Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood (yeah I know but he's a moderate Republican), Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep and so on are amongst the most popular actors amongst Boomers, and very much not fascist. The big sporting figures, Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Willie Mays, Bill Russell, very much not fascists. 

I'm Gen Z, but the point you are trying to say is literally the opposite of reality. These actors weren't most popular with boomers, and there is a line in history (somewhere between 63-65) where Western media diverges from the more traditional conservative sort of things and pushes in the opposite direction to attract boomers, and it's very obvious looking at the changes in fashion, music, the way people talked, spiritual and political beliefs and that sort of thing. It's fucken stupid how boomers get characterised as a conservative generation when their youth was far more extreme than the youth of today. Mainstream music, film and magazines are a lot more mainstream and less experimental, fashion is a lot plainer and more conservative in some ways and celebrities now are a lot, lot more commercial and conservative than the ones that the boomers idolised.",1647331624.0,3

He became legendary as Razor Ramon in WWF and continued to be successful in WCW as a founding member of the NWO.

But then after his life started to spiral out of control. He was known for showing up completely wasted an indie shows. Pretty much every wrestling fan considered him a lost cause.

But somehow, with the help of fellow legend Diamond Dallas Page, Hall was able to turn his life around and finally gave us insight into how great of a mind he had for wrestling. I always wished to see his return as a manager or trainer. So sad to see him go; wish he‚Äôd been around more but he could‚Äôve left us much earlier.

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead. That knowledge, that I would take someone else's life, even in self defense, has permanently fucked up my mind. I thought I was a pacifist. I never knew how I would feel or what decisions I would make until I was in that situation. But now I know and I can't unknow it anymore.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die. 

Killing a person in self defense, to protect yourself. You're not responsible for being in that situation, you're just trying to find a way out. It being justifiable is no solace for the conscience.",1647282578.0,47

While I can't speak to your very specific and extremely traumatizing experience, I just wanted to share the perspective that pacifism and the right to defend yourself against the aggression of others are not at all at odds with each other.

I'm not religious myself, but **even Jesus** told people that nobody could be expected to just sit there and take any kind of treatment. He said, ""If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men."" To me, those provisos were his way saying, ""Be nice to people, but if someone comes around looking for a fight, that's on them, not on you.""

And as far as the ""turn the other cheek"" concept, I like this interpretation:

>At the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to be of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and dominance. If the persecuted person ""turned the other cheek,"" the discipliner was faced with a dilemma: The left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was demanding equality.

>Wink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10‚Äì13). By giving the lender the cloak as well, the debtor was reduced to nakedness. Wink notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, and not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20‚Äì23).

>Wink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions.[3] In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law, as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law.[4]",1647301393.0,2

I'm a bit of a rambler but I'll do my best to keep it concise, but there was a lot going on all at once. 

I had moved in with my then boyfriend of two years (now husband) and our roommate (best friend of husband, close friend of mine). We lived in a 340 sqft studio apartment (yes, that's a really small apartment for three people! It was supposed to be temporary while we looked for a 2 bedroom apartment) in one of those old apartments where they just stacked some studios on top of each other in concrete squares. We lived in the biggest city in the state and studios were the cheapest living, especially split three ways. It was the kind of place where when we heard scratches in the walls, we just assumed rats because well, its a shitty old apartment. 

On February 17th, we were woken up to a knocking sound coming from upstairs, like someone was aggressively putting together IKEA furniture. It woke my boyfriend and I up, and I just covered my head with my pillow. We had heard noises late at night from him so we just always assumed he worked night shift. Well this night, the banging noises didn't stop, and went on throughout the day until 1PM. 

At 8AM, my boyfriend got out of bed, and went to work. Our upstairs neighbor ran down the stairs, chased him into the parking lot and said ""If I ever catch you in my apartment again, I'll fucking kill you!""

Having never BEEN in this man's apartment, my boyfriend was confused, said ""Okay man"" and got in his car and started driving to work. He called me on the way and told me to make sure the deadbolt was locked. I did and told him to call the non emergency line (Note: At this time, we just thought this dude was victim of a break in and thought my boyfriend was part of it, we had no idea what was going on here). So he called them, they said they'd send someone over and to be home by 2 so we could give our statement. 

The roommate and I go about our day, listening to the banging, semi worried, mostly focused on applying for jobs (both of us recently unemployed). I'm more concerned than our roommate, but just waited for the cop to get here. 

Boyfriend comes back at noon, the banging stops at 1PM, at 2PM a cop comes over. She comes in, listens to our side of things (""We dont know this dude"",""weird noises last night"" ""threatened to kill me if i ever went into his apartment, I've never been in there"",etc), and goes up to talk to the neighbor. 

40 minutes go by. We can hear them through the floor, which really should have been a clue that the floor's structural integrity wasn't how it used to be. 

After 40 minutes, she comes back down and knocks on our door. We open the door for her, and she comes back in, turns around and deadbolts the door immediately. I'll never forget how she turned back to us and said ""Holy shit guys, its so much worse than we thought."" because that was the LAST thing I'd ever want a cop to say. I remember I burst out laughing. At the time life had been really rough on me and this just felt like a kick to the nuts. Of course it was worse than we thought. 

So I can't remember everything, there was a lot, but basically she went up there and this guy had FIVE locks on his door, that he himself had installed. He was VERY excited that a cop had ""finally"" come to help him. He claimed several things, but the ones that I can remember were that we had been floating (yes, floating) through the ceiling, whispering to him about how we would ""get"" him, how no one would ever believe him, how they'd never find his body, he claimed we had been sexually assaulting him every night, we've been spying on him and had put cameras in his apartment, he just couldn't find them because they were imperceivably small. How'd we get them in there? Well when we floated in there. Also that we had stolen his watch, his belt and had been drinking the milk from his fridge. 

So that knocking noise we had been hearing, from 3:30AM to about 1PM - well apparently he had decided he had had enough and ripped up all the carpet in the apartment and began digging a hole into his floor/our ceiling, to ""take care of the three punks downstairs"" and if the cops didn't do something about it, ""\[he\] would do what he needed to do, they needed to be stopped"" - based on his threat to my boyfriend, we took this to mean he planned on killing all of us. 

Oh, and what we thought were rats? Yeah turns out that he wanted to counter spy on us and had bought cameras and had been pushing them down the vents to try and spy on us. The  vents were in the bathrooms. I try not to think about it too much cuz the idea that this guy had footage of my 11PM shits and shower snot rockets (and you know, my naked body) is too creepy. The cop said the cameras he got weren't good quality nor were they hooked up to any sort of device that could save all the footage but still.

Not sure if this psychologically makes a difference. But I've read that snipers often go through a lot of mental stress because they're ""closer"" to the enemy than other soldiers.

I'm slightly shaking, partially out of terror but mostly from rage. Thankfully the cop is trained in mental health crisis, but this is a doozy even for her. She said the creepiet thing is the man APPEARED sound of mind. If it wasn't for the five locks on the door and  talking about us floating through the floor, he didn't come off like a lunatic. He had a job. He had no record (she checked) of mental health or criminal issues, though he did come from out of state, so we dont really know his background. 

  
So she tells us the game plan. In our state, if she admitted him involuntarily today, they would have to take his accusations seriously. He apparently wanted a rape kit done on him. If they did that, we would be continually exposed to this guy, and the cop could tell we were just knocked out of left field by this. It'd be months or YEARS of this following us around. So instead, she told us she would tell our apartment we needed to break lease and emergency vacate the apartment (the apartment had been notified at this point that this dude had ripped up the carpet and several light fixtures). Due to tennant laws in our state, they couldn't evict him immediately, but she could get us away from him immediately and she knew if we stayed he would eventually attack us. So what we had to do was vacate the apartment and get a restraining order. Because my boyfriend was technically the only one on the lease, he had to go get the restraining order. So he had to leave, and the cop had to leave to go with him and report to the judge.  She said she had called backup, but because this guy hadn't even technically gotten in, we had to wait for some cops to get done with other calls and get to us. The reason this needed to happen this way and with this timeline, was because if we got a restraining order first, and THEN he was admitted after we left the apartment, when they admitted him and he said ""my downstairs neighbors were r\*ping me"" the cop could say ""He doesn't have downstairs neighbors and the ones he did have have a restraining order against him"". It was the best way to protect us from dealing with it for years. But it meant leaving me and my roommate alone in the apartment. 

Before she left with my boyfriend to get the restraining order (This took a total of SIX HOURS because at this point it was 4PM on a Friday and the judge supposed to take care of our district had already left by the time they got to the courthouse. The whole time my boyfriends phone was dying so I had no clue when he'd get back) she asked if we had a gun on hand. We said yes - my boyfriends shotgun. She asked if I or the roommate knew how to use it, I said I did. In fact a month ago I had learned from a friend in the coast guard how to combat load it. She told me to keep it on hand but out of reach from the door. She had lied to the neighbor upstairs and claimed to be taking my boyfriend in for questioning, but had no clue if he would stay in his apartment like ordered. Not that that was safe either as he had already decided tunneling to us was a solution to his problems. 

I knew we were in a bad situation because the cop seemed so upset because she couldn't keep us safe. We were in a hard situation. Everyone involved in this was in a difficult situation, even mr crazypants upstairs. 

So that's how I sat, holding a shotgun in my lap for about six hours, next to my roommate, waiting for the crazy person upstairs to realize a door was much thinner and easier to get through than a floor-ceiling. And realized in that moment that if he came through the door, I was going to pull that trigger. That was honestly more traumatizing than realizing someone wanted to kill me - realizing that I was willing to kill them back. I think about that moment a lot, especially around the anniversary. It makes me feel cold in my soul. It takes something different inside someone to take a life, even in self defense, and you don't know its inside you until you're there. I haven't been able to watch the Life of Pi since, because I know what its like, having that Tiger on the boat (assuming you subscribe to that metaphorical interpretation). It's been five years and I still feel weird about that knowledge of myself now. 

To sum up the ending of a very, very long story, after six hours my boyfriend got the restraining order and the cops escorted us out of the apartment. We had just our backpacks, my medications, and the shotgun. We slept on several friends couches for two weeks while we tried to find a new apartment (and we did, eventually going back for our stuff). The first night I didn't sleep at all, just laid down next to my friends two puppies petting them, listening to my roommate and boyfriend snore. Last I had heard they were admitting mr crazy pants to a psychiatric hospital. That was five years ago and to be honest, I didn't really care to pursue it and just wanted as far away from it as possible.

I've now married said boyfriend and still am great friends with the roommate (who now has a girlfriend himself and god they're so cute together). Hilariously the \*NEXT\* upstairs neighbor (the one that ordered takeout every weekend and scared me haha) ended up being a therapist and helped me find a good one. I'm also god-mom to his dogs and he ended up playing Led Zeplin as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. So not all my neighbors have been bad lol

I just wanted to end by saying, I do not feel hatred towards the neighbor. I mostly feel pity. He thought we were torturing him, and if someone had been floating up and sexually assaulting me, I probably also would want to kill them. However I also do not feel guilt about holding a shotgun ready to shoot him, and I would not have felt guilty about shooting him if I had to. He was the one threatening to kill us after all and I'm sure if he had managed to kill my husband I probably WOULD hate him. I still cannot put into words how I exactly feel about it. My hope is he got help, somehow, and never put anyone else in danger. 

Hope you enjoyed the ride. I keep telling myself I'll put it on youtube but never get around to it lol",1647304309.0,9

Why Does Sticking One Foot out of the Bed Help You Sleep?

What does that have to do with our feet? A whole lot, actually. ‚ÄúFeet play a huge part in regulating your body temperature because they, unlike other parts of the body, contain arteriovenous anastomoses \[links between arteries and veins\], which dilate in warm temperatures, allowing more blood to reach the surface of the skin in order to cool it down,‚Äù Cralle says. ‚ÄúPlus, the bottoms of your feet are hairless, which helps to keep them cool.‚Äù That means, much like Cralle‚Äôs warm bath trick, sticking our feet out from under the warmth of the bedding helps along our bodies‚Äô natural pre-sleep cooling process, causing us to fall more quickly into a restful slumber.",1647302740.0,12
