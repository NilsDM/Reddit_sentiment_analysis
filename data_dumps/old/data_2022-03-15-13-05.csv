300,funny,Dolphin trolls a seagull!,Ltcommander83,1647353576.0,626,35789,0.96,"The two instances of dolphin intelligence that stuck with me the most:

1) [The Dolphin fishermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwWfYLKFw0) in Brazil. Basically *the dolphins* figured out they can catch more fish if they work with us, so they purposefully chase schools of fish into our nets. This plan was concocted by the dolphins, ***NOT*** by the local fishermen, and the dolphins call the shots for all the fishing jobs. They signal, they choose where to fish, they choose when to fish, they're clearly in charge and the brains of the operation. All we did was recognize the value and play along.

2) Wish I had kept the vid of this but didn't wanna watch it again when I first found it: it was in Japan. A bunch of fishermen cornered a dolphin in a cove (is that the right word? Rock formation along the coast where you could block off one part and trap anything in the water) and it being Japan, of course the goal was to catch it and eat it. The dolphin was distressed and trying to escape, but couldn't. The dolphin's last ditch escape attempt...? It lept out of the water and onto the rocks, leaping towards one white, blonde tourist duo in a group of otherwise japanese fishermen. It was like the dolphin could recognize the dangerous ones and the *only* duo present that might help the dolphin, so the dolphin lept to them for help. That was....painful to watch. Whether the dolphin could recognize the difference due to the languages being spoken, the different physical features, the clothing or what have you...it doesn't matter. If they're smart enough to recognize such a difference and use that to make a logical conclusion, then we probably have no business killing and eating the damned things.",1647366909.0,1

So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide.

Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

It's a tough decision typically made in good conscious and the science still isn't exactly clear. I think it's best to allow abortion but decrease and disincentivize it through increased access to (very affordable, if not free) birth control, parenting services, extended/paid maternity leave, etc. 

2) I like a freer market, generally-speaking, but obviously corporations can't always be trusted to act in the best interests of their societies. Sometimes they do, like various companies currently withdrawing business from Russia. And sometimes they're like Nestle and they do shady shit. There should be some regulations. 

3) We simply spend too much. A lot of it bureaucratic, unnecessary waste. I think cutting the scope and size of the government is important. 

4) Capital punishment is a sad but regrettably necessary punishment for some of society's worst offenders.

It's often why churches in Black communities have an outsized influence--if you're raised in an environment where your family isn't there to support you, places like churches will. 

For example--say you have a job interview. But you need a ride? Can you get one? If you have social capital, it would be nothing for you to call up your parents or a nearby friend to make it work. But if your ""social capital"" is small or nonexistent--what are you going to do? There are alternatives, but they're often expensive and/or hard to arrange. 

It's also one of the ways in which the decline of things like churches, fraternal orders, etc, can have a negative impact, because the internet's not going to help in this sense. If all the friends you have live across the country, they can't help babysit your kid. It used to be if you needed advice--""Hey, anyone know a plumber?"" you could ask that after church and get a good recommendation. Today? Hope your plumber has a great SEO!

And this isn't a government thing.

1376,AskReddit,What's your most conservative opinion?,ritzanddazzle,1647363796.0,2697,966,0.88,"Honestly, the issue with the death penalty is a philosohical quandary that effects the whole justice system, but is most significant in regard to the death penalty.

And forget all the other bullshit excuses people may give you, this is the only indisputable argument against it, and that is the fallibility of evidence, and the judiciary system as well. We have many cases of people being unanimously convicted of crimes they didn't commit, crimes often later overturned with new evidence or later being evaluated to have a clear lack of sufficient evidence, or having found heavy bias or discrimination in the courts themselves.

A 50 year sentence is overturnable as long as the convicted lives, even if the wrongfully convicted may never get true compensation for what time they lost they may get the chance to enjoy what little they have left, and especially if you don't belive in the afterlife, one would think every bit of time in life a person is able to experience is sacred, and unjustly taking that away is unforgiveable.

A death penatly cannot be overturned or retracted once it is given out, the fallibility of the judicial system may be workable and remediated, but a fallacy of the judicial system that cannot be amended is a judicial system that is made to be inherently flawed. You are ending up with a judicial system that inherently agrees with the possibility of taking someones entire life in an irreversible way on the basis of having a sufficiently satisfy punishing against people who's ability to harm society may be remedied insignificantly less damaging ways.

The only issue with it is the cost, but my opinion is that people convicted of capital crimes with a relatively assurable level of evidence should be given unreducable life sentences with the allowance of ""voluntary euthanasia"", though unlikely to be a highly utilised option.",1647371389.0,1

I'm worried about the erosion of female identity by removing all references to ""women"" in women's spaces.

Back in the day, the majority of auditions in symphonies were done in person in an open audition, but it was found the judges favored men over women in this setting. To combat this, blind auditions were performed and the number of men vs women became relatively equal as a result. As a consequence, most of the orchestral members were either white or Asian. Blind auditions were then taken away as a means to add cultural diversity to orchestras. 

Is this an ethical way to reward the talent and hard work of musical performers who have devoted their entire lives to developing their talent at this level? If not, what is? Should we use blind auditions? Or go back to open auditions?",1647372595.0,1

If we assume that one does not trust those in power, does not believe that those with money or legislative authority act in the best interest of society, etc, *then why the fuck would you ever want to give THEM the discretion to use their money and power however they want to?*

EG: means-tested vs non-means-tested social programs. If everyone in Washington is evil, then why would you want to give them the power to decide who is worthy of healthcare, housing, education, legal representation, or emergency services? The first 2 we means-test for in the US, the last 3 we (thankfully, currently) do not. Passing M4A doesn't *give* government more power, it strips their power to call the shots on who is sufficiently poor/old enough to deserve healthcare away. 

I specifically do NOT want politicians in charge of determining who gets to live a dignified life in this country; I want them literally beholden to every citizen of this country in the same way they are beholden to provide K-12 education and legal representation.

Would it really make for a smaller government if parents had to prove they were sufficiently poor enough to have access to free K-12 education?

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting. 

Basically, you don’t experience a heart attack every day, so your brain’s first interpretation of this event can be kinda wonky.  Think of it like when your check engine light comes on for something you know isn’t related to the engine 

It is called “Referred Pain.”  It goes against everything we understand about how pain signals work.  This is also why your left arm can hurt during a heart attack, but not many people are aware that other organs are innervated by the same exact nerve",1647349236.0,52

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind’s rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being “normal,” be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, “Well, now you’re just like the rest of us,” meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present “normal” self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

1798,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,10078,24783,0.92,"I'm fine now, but:

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back *(Edit: pushed back mostly using my legs, as I was in a crouched position)* and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

Increased pressure in your pelvis/abdomen from internal bleeding can stimulate a nerve I think around your diaphragm, and that nerve goes up your chest and a bit into your shoulder. So something like an ectopic pregnancy can make the tip of your shoulder hurt!",1647361079.0,176

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

Pooping black usually means blood from the stomach, but a brisk upper GI bleed can put out red blood per rectum. 

One thing to know about medicine, the typical presentation is not always the most likely. But the laws of physics still apply. Black stool can be from the colon, sure. But you’d never throw up blood from the colon. 

Getting a good history and exam on your patient, assessing the vitals, and triaging are key. Labs are helpful but the change in blood count lags far behind blood loss.

I agree with you, it should be treated as a stroke even if you think it’s a migraine. Time is of the essence with strokes. If I get a repeat of the symptoms I’ll still go to the ER.

About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn’t sleep. Didn’t need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn’t focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn’t remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I’ve described seek medical attention.

It’s been two years almost now since that event and I’m still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight. I’m talking 80 pounds or so. I’ve been through a few other medications and psychiatrists and think I’ve finally found one who understands what the drug interaction did. I don’t know for sure if Im actually bipolar or if it was the drugs but I have been safely off of medication for months now and feel ok. Hopefully this new doctor can help me sort things out.",1647353934.0,121

It's an amazing display of heroism.

The never ending chain of ""holy crap we're royally fucked"" moments. And finally the courtroom description of the accident interweaved with the reenactment is *such* a gripping episode.

IMO, it's more of a positional statement about what the speaker thinks something should enable than a meaningful description. Every structure encourages or discourages particular uses. ""Hostile architecture"" is what you get when a a group (example: parks staff) has to deal with the consequences of a problem they are in no way equipped to handle (ex: homelessness, or your euphemism of choice).

It's generally a sign of a much larger problem. It's also easy to rail against without thinking carefully about why well-meaning people possessed of kindness and compassion and empathy might choose what others might call hostile architecture. In this example, your average parks department is in no way funded or staffed to provide housing, mental healthy care, physical health care, chemical dependency support, social support services, etc. What they can do is try to keep the parks usable in some fashion by the general public.",1647364329.0,8

But sadly I fear that companies will look at the formula and miss interpret everything.

Like the lack of a quest track, or how devoided of orientation the game is to make navigating the world and finding things as rewarding as possible. I fear this will be subverted to thinking that games with bad uis should be the norm, or that lack of content = having to explore to find quests.

To me what makes ER great is how nothing is given to you for free. And you can play the game and miss a lot of amazing stuff, but the devs don't put an arrow trying to direct players to that amazing piece if content they threw in hundreds of hours creating. Instead if you find it then it just makes it even more amazing that you actually found that amazing moment or item.

I feel like ER invoque a sense of high punishment but also high reward in the sense that you need to try to get the best out of the game, and if you chose to not devote yourself to it, then it won't give everything back at you. It gives in equal proportion to what you are willing to invest I exploration, time and paying attention to what the devs created.

I might be a bit enamored with the game right now, but I honestly feel like few games have the guts to throw a player into a gigantic world full of content but hide the best away and force you to work for it.

Let the games art and environment design speak for your world as opposed to letting the repetitive simple sidequests (go talk to this guy, then come back and talk to me so I can send you to talk to that guy again), tower climbing to unlock map area, enemy base takeover, detective lens mechanic etc. speak for your game.

Spend all that development time on world building instead. I feel like some devs justify all those things so that the game value is higher, but it does the exact opposite and in some cases makes the game less memorable because every other open world game does it. I wish more games would prioritize enemy/boss design over that bloat aswell, it's crazy how many different bosses/enemy types we encounter in souls games compared to others. Part of it may be engine-related (Souls games haven't had the biggest graphical upgrades over time so less engine development and direct/linear story building involved), but I think it's also a matter of what devs are prioritizing for the player experience.",1647372564.0,1

also ""double jump""

Arguably a bad feature if you want your platform game to be unique and challenging, any main dedicated platforming game that has double jump as default it is probably aimed for E rated games and  5-10 years old demographic.

You need to make it rewarding, either by having some challenging and fun encounters or some form of reward that is somehow interesting. They also need to stop handholding so much when it comes to exploration, I don't need to know exactly where everything is. Not having any question marks or waypoints to where stuff is made me naturally want to explore the world.

When you see a world filled with spots of interest, it gets daunting and it feels like checking boxes. While it is not truly any different in Elden Ring, you never feel like you should go there and investigate it just so that you can make the icon on the map green, you do it because you want to see what is there. When you yourself decide that it looks like an interesting place to visit, it just feels more rewarding.

And games have to have more unique rewards, which also means a much more set in stone gear and loot system. I am so fucking done with randomized RNG loot, that never feels rewarding to me. Whenever I find a new cool weapon in Elden Ring, I may not use it, but it is usually always interesting to just try it out for a few fights, just to see if this is perhaps something I would like to play with on a different build.

And of course the best thing about Elden Ring is that the world is so intricate and just so detailed in how it is designed that you want to explore every little corner of it. So many secret paths and just naturally cool locations to explore. After a while, some of the encounters do become repetitive and sometimes you face similar bosses. But it is still enjoyable because you always get something out of it.

The biggest issues I have with Elden Ring and its design is upgrading weapon costs, it kinda defeats the purpose of creating your own build when you feel forced to stick with the first weapons you get because it just costs too much to upgrade new ones. And while it may be an unpopular opinion, I wish the story was told with more cutscenes and a bit more exposition as I still don't know what is really going on in the world. I don't need a quest log to show me where I should go next, but some form of record of people I have met and their dialogue would help a lot. I feel kind of forced to look up on the internet to see what I may have missed.

This is so far one of my favorite games of all time, if someone can make a game like this with the level of story and NPC interacting that Witcher 3 has, it would be a true masterpiece of a game.",1647373567.0,1

The difficulty works in these games because it's paired with two things: high lethality, and high player expression. 

Most bosses take less than 30 hits to kill, which is really quite few when you consider how fast players attack. Fights are decided quickly - it's pretty rare for a fight to be ""close"", usually either the player has mastered the boss and wipes the floor with them or the boss one shots the player at some point. The combat is lethal, enemies kill the player quickly but players can do the same to enemies. When the player one shots a mook with a backstab or burns down a tough enemy in a single R1 combo, it feels good - and when an enemy fakes you out and rips your health apart, you feel suitably humbled.

And on the other side, the player expression in the game is huge. A parrying dagger user is going to play different from someone powerstancing greatswords, will play massively different from an arcane spellcaster, will play different from a dodgeroll spamming quality build, etc. I've cut apart bosses people were stuck on for hours, and been stonewalled by bosses that most people basically shrugged off, because how I express myself in combat - the stats and buffs and consumables and gear I use - is different and gives me an advantage over some bosses and is flattened by others.

It's fitting that this joke ~~originally came from~~ is stolen from IronPineapple, because he covers a lot of games that make this mistake in his Steam Dumpster Diving series. A lot of fans of Souls-like games think that the difficulty is the defining feature. But it's really not, the games are hard but that's because they pull their punches *less* than other games (though they still heavily favor the player). But to counter this, the player gets *way* more options than most ARPG's give you that can give you the edge over your enemy *if you know how to leverage them*. You can't have one without the other, the game doesn't hold your hand but *that's because it gave you the options that an easier game would have handled for you*.",1647374205.0,1

Without spoiling anything for others who don't have as much progress, there is a huge problem with quest lines in the game. One quest line gets locked if you complete an optional dungeon too early.  Too early doesn't mean you do some speed run skips or warps, it literally is just arbitrary. You can progress and most people who don't look at guides will just follow the path thats open to them and accidentally lock themselves out of it. 

Did I also mention this questline has a bunch of items(weapons and armor) locked behind it? It does and it frustrates me that you can lock yourself out of it. I'm fine with this style of thing if it was a choice(x or y questline for dungeon), but you can literally do everything if you hold off on x until y is done. Its not a choice, its bad design. 

Not to mention, some npcs early in the quest tell you that the quest isn't morally good. Most people might shrug that off since its a Soulsborne, but new players might think ""Hey, I should do this quest line after the other one since it might have permanent negative effects"". It doesn't.

I get that you don't need every item to have fun in the game, but that should be up to player choice, not player knowledge. FF12 had a more extreme version, if you opened any of a certain amount of fake chests, you literally couldn't get the best spear in the game. These chests were randomly dispersed throughout the game and the game didn't telegraph and say ""Hey if you open certain chests, you might not be able to get x item"". This isn't nearly as bad as that, but it shares the same element of frustration due to a player not googling everything. I'm lucky I became obsessed with the game early in my playtime and came by this fact. Otherwise, I might have locked myself out.

So whats the solution? Either don't make the questlines you are locked out of lock you out of items(for example, you could have an alternative way of obtaining the items), make it a clearly telegraphed choice, or make the questline not dependent on arbitrary completion. You can easily make another npc offer a similar questline if for some reason the choice makes the original quest giver angry at you.

For anyone early on that might be deterred from playing blind by this, maybe I can give a bit of info to help. If you are doing an optional dungeon(or at least one that you aren't sure of), make sure you complete any quests you want before the final boss of that dungeon.",1647369538.0,1

1. Balance. It's pretty poor thanks to the open world both in upgrading and natural progression.
2. The final third. It's absurdly difficult in bad ways, not ""fair"" ways.
3. Reused assets. Much like all open world games, if you need to reuse that many assets, shorten the game instead of doing the opposite and padding it.
4. Boss design. The movements themselves and the difficulty feel worse than before. My #1 complaint is the lack of ability to punish, mostly with the main story bosses. I think BB, DS3, and Sekiro blow ER out of the water with boss design. There's zero flow and some of the actual choices are baffling. Shit like Radahn and Malenia don't even seem to have been playtested. Then add shit like how about midway through the game, the game gets lazy as fuck and just starts spamming gank fights with previous used enemies.
5. The open world. It's empty. I'm kinda baffled people are claiming it's dense. It has no more weapons or enemy variety than something like DS3 which is obvious much less smaller. Exploration isn't really worth it if you like your current weapons and/or ashes. Like I don't miss collecting BS collectibles just for  shit achievement, but the world is quite barren. It doesn't feel lived in at all.
6. Side content. I know this is FromSoft's thing but if you're gonna have a 100+ hour game, you need something other than combat. There's nothing other than combat.  Other open worlds like Witcher, Horizon, Oblivion, etc. don't add random content like side mission, parkour challenges, mini games, puzzles, etc. because they're padding the game. They know that if you're gonna spend a long time on something, it's nice to break the flow. That doesn't exist in ER. The exclusive thing to break flow is exploration, exploration that leads to more combat.
7. Side missions. Keeping the same side quest style as Souls/BB/Sekiro is just dumb. You can't be as obtuse when you're switching from 20/30 hours to 100. They don't even have a log.",1647369020.0,5

Yea the final part has been hard but I also had low vigor so I just invested in Health and I was good to go there's plenty of ways to get tons of runes for leveling. 

Compared to many other open world games I've played this game doesn't reuse nearly as much. Sure it's less exciting when you fight the same enemy or boss again but one the reused bosses are pretty much all optional meaning your expectations aren't as high and two there's so much unique locations and enemies that the reused stuff isnt as bad. I can't think of another open world game with this much distinct visual variety and enemy variety. 

That boss point is super subjective and for me and many others it's just learning attacks or using the right tools no boss has really seemed unfair just some take longer to learn than others. 

I don't understand how you think the world is empty there's so much stuff all over the place and the lack of objective markers makes it better to explore it isn't that stupid checklist style of open world. If you're not willing to experiment and try new load outs than it's your fault the rewards are boring for you. Respecing is easier than ever and you can't blame the game when you're refusing to change how you play and try something new.  

It's a souls game and you're surprised it has souls gameplay im for one glad they don't just add a bunch of open world bs and stick with what they do best and do that one thing well. 

Yea there's no quest log and it's a bit annoying but the side quests I do solve on my own are super satisfying. These game are vague and obtuse so the community can discover things together and it's that which makes these games so enduring.",1647370598.0,5

As far as reused assets go, there are a few annoying examples but the majority are overblown. Erdtree guardians and the rot beasts are definitely the worst examples. Crucible knights are another frequently listed example but I feel there's enough variety amongst the variants to defer that complaint.

Your complaints about the bosses are too vague to properly respond to. The only thing I can see is ""the windows of opportunity are too small"". This is just a case of the git guds. You're not supposed to be able to nuke them down in one or two combos like many bosses could be cheesed in past games. The new design is intended to make the fights as a fight instead of a quick comp stomp.

As far as exploration goes the map is certainly larger than it needs to be, which is why you get a horse for travel. The point with exploration is that every point of interest has something worthwhile. Not that it has something for every build, or for every playthrough. Just skip it if you don't want the loot.

Most of your listed examples just have checkbox collectibles aka garbage filler content. Obviously if you like checking boxes then you'll enjoy games where boxes are being checked, but it has no place in Elden Ring's setting, nor does it fit the gameplay.

You see examples of these principles being used across mediums (movies, tv, photography, graphic design, etc.) so why everyone in this thread is having such a hard time believing experienced video game designers would be employing them too is baffling to me.  


Sure, there is more that goes into level design than just this, that's not what OP was saying.

Ignoring that I flat out just don’t think a lot of this is true (green arrows really feel like a stretch).

If it were, I don’t think it’s good design for the average gamer due to what you SHOULD be doing.

Going to the castle right away, for most gamers new to this series, is an absolute death wish. While I agree the castle should be the ultimate first major goal, it’s way too close to where you start.

Better design would have been placing your spawn in an area where your only choice was to do a lot of exploring before you hit the castle and with nothing really behind you.

It’s really weird that there is an entire island behind you with arguably easier enemies and dungeons that’s really out of the way compared to the one you start in.

Not that it’s a bad game (love it and most enjoyable platinum I’ve gotten in awhile) but I think people go into this as Souls fans and veterans. Doing co-op with my friends who for them this is their first Souls game, a lot is really weirdly directed in terms of expected level for areas.

But, let’s say a player follows the gold pixie dust aka “the main quest” right. And they follow it religiously.

That “funnels” you north to the Church of Elleh, then then cliffs ease you into the Gatefront Ruins, up the valley to the Stormhill Shack all leading you to, and then through, Stormveil Castle right?

Ok, so say you manage to plug away and beat Stormveil without thinking, “fuck it this is hard, I’m going to explore”. Then you’d beat Godrick and then it’d organically funnel you through the back into Liurnia. Not Limgrave East or the Weeping Peninsula, and definitely not Caelid.

But eventually, you’ll hit a roadblock at the Grand Lift of Dectus. Essentially a “zone portal” that’s inaccessible until you’ve retrieved the 2 halves of this token that activates the Grand Lift.

Now this is where it gets brilliant. Those 2 halves are located in Limgrave East, and Caelid.

So the game will “flow” you to explore most of the southern expanse of the map.

But, let’s say you’re an explorationist like me. Well then you might go and explore and earn the two halves of the medallion far before ever reaching the Grand Lift itself. 

So an example of what makes this game great, is how, you’re not “punished” for exploring. Some games might make you double back to the spots to get the medallion pieces, because until you’ve interacted with the Grand Lift (to use this Elden Ring as a wider example); those medallion pieces aren’t attainable.

Now of course that’s really poor design, but yeah, just to highlight another “flow” pattern this game has in the first half-ish of the game",1647369956.0,1

BOTW for example uses a cutscene when you enter the world to show the end goal in the distance over a landscape with not many features, also you're on the edge of a cliff with no indication of where to go next... until the camera swoops around over 90 degrees passing over some large mountain features in the distance  to point you down the only path then cuts to an npc who heads in the direction of the first story moment.

From Software does all this and more in one view. It allows the world to guide the way, not the camera.   

BOTW is meant to be easier and more obvious so using camera cuts to draw focus isn't a bad thing, but at least at the beginning of the game there's stuff in the distance in multiple directions with no sense of how to get there or what's beyond, (it does eventually gives you those things.)

You summed things up well at the bottom of your post but for some reason feel the need to be nitpicky.
 
Its not literally every line and only those lines:
this would look silly and artificial, of course there are some lines not aligned with the focus of attention its supposed to look like an open organic world.   But if you were to draw an arrow over every single visual element the length and numbers of the lines radiating from/to the church would noticeably stand out.  

There also doesn't need to be an actual arrow type end indicating direction : if the majority of lines focus on a single point it naturally draws attention there. the other end of the lines have no focus because they go every other direction and don't add to anything


Besides even your examples of the ruins and bridge and towers do actually support drawing focus to the church. they create a horizontal cut off to frame the church between the bridge/castle line and matching line of the stone floor at the bottom of the image.  

They aren't leading lines for the church but they are for the ""where you're going"" part of the image - a secondary focus. 

And while the player doesn't know or need to know the story purpose of each visual element - its not over analyzing to point out this was likely a deliberate design choice to feature them all in one view.   

 Also a giant glowing tree is definitely not ""just a skybox""  every new player I've seen looks at it and goes ""whoa"".",1647369383.0,1

So many games do this when you exit a tutorial or when you discover a new area. It's just good game design.  
Fallout 3 for example. Exit the vault and you are presented with 3 options and an attention grabber.  
A sign points out a place called ""megaton"" exists and is nearby.  
The road to the left looks inviting and has immediate likely loot locations,  in this direction lies the main quest. The road right goes over a hill that is closer to you then the loot locations to the left. The unbeaten path beckons. This path leads to immediate adventure and random encounters.

Elden Ring deserves the love it's gotten, but it's not the best open world, and I'd argue it's not even the best From Software game (Bloodborne is head and shoulders above, imo).

The NPC literally says to go down for a tutorial before going through the doors. There is even an item up on a ledge implying there is a way to possibly get to it if you go down.

That being said Elden Ring has a lot more deliberate design put into its world structure to guide players. Even the locations of the map fragments for each area and what parts of the map they uncover are meant to guide you towards a certain path (i.e. the very first map fragment when you enter the lake in Liurnia reveals the eastern coast of the lake, not the lake center itself, and not the west coast, that's very intentional). They put the guidance of grace markers for people who have gotten off the main story path to make it easier to figure out where to go next.

in ER there isn't necessarily a ""wrong"" way to go but there is definitely a loose path clearly intended by From. It's evident by things like map fragment locations, NPC locations and the progression through their quests (Hyetta is a big one that people say is hard to find, yet if you follow the way the map reveals you find her at every one of her locations really easily), item placement in different locations that look inaccessible, placing obvious easy to spot enemies like jellyfish around hidden entrances, large markers that stand out on the horizon from vantage points, as well as simple enemy scaling (you just got teleported to the crystal tunnels in caelid, you can't kill shit and get instantly wiped, maybe this is an area for later, just like the skeletons in DS1).

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

It wasn’t too bad and you could still quick scope but that created another issue, people bitching about quick scoping in game. Apparently it’s frowned upon to quick scope in COD.

It’s from a smaller studio so it doesn’t have the graphical polish or menu crispness of a COD.  But, it’s one level more realistic than COD and Battlefield, and I’m in love.  

It’s a little slower, one or two bullets kill, no future sci fi gadgets, can’t shoot whilst going prone or jumping (get the COD babies outta here! Lol), etc. It’s all about strategy and long term communication.  

I’m not going to sit here and pretend that every game is full of team communicators.  But, everything in this regard is better than COD.  If you create what you want - communication, teamwork, call outs - you’ll get it here in return more than any other FPS I’ve played.

Edit: referring to Insurgency Sandstorm, the game in the original post.  I play on PS5 and from the games subs I hear the player base is a little better here than on PC.  Maybe because it’s only six months old here.

whereas campaign & spec ops? you can uninstall those all day. but warzone is just a game mode basically, if you didnt want the warzone files...you wouldnt have the mp files, then!

so you arent missing out on space, mw is just THIQQ.

this is why they specifically split up mw2/022 & warzone 2. but all files the files you need are the same for both, possibly with negligible exceptions.",1647354166.0,9

One of them is called the stencil buffer. When rendering the scope, other than just writing to the colour buffer (that's the pixels you see), you also write to this stencil buffer. So if the stencil buffers was just filled with 0s, you fill up the area the scope renders with 1s.

4890,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,957,65538,0.96,"This is absolutely incorrect.

“Tenga” is the wrong form of “tener” to use in this case. Guy in the video said it twice, knew it didn’t sound right, and corrected himself the third time.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying “tengas”. It doesn’t change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you’re misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. “¿No tengas?” is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are “no tengas miedo” (don’t be afraid), “espero que tengas dinero” (I expect that you’ll have money), and “ojalá que tengas mamá” (I hope you have a mom).

4891,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,957,65538,0.96,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mamá"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mamá?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -》 ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mamá) es triste"" -》 ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mamá"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,3

The chick's parents will not return so long as they perceive a threat is near.

The only living thing benefiting from this act is the human who felt good about themselves after projecting their own feelings about thirst and the benefits of hydration onto an animal that has no need or concept of the act that was just performed.

You can play games with people you never met. You can now video call your grandma who lives in another country. All thanks to tech gaints.

When he dropped a new music video, it was pretty big news. It was the equivalent of a blockbuster theatrical release on opening day. 

I remember just being a kid and watching one of his televised concerts, and even then marveling that he was the greatest performer in the world.

On the flipside, he became increasingly featured in gossip column and rumors. His name was being bounced around nonstop for one reason or another.

Edited to add: I remember a rumor about his signature moonwalk dance started to spiral out of control. Some people did not believe he could physically do it, and that it was some sort of trick involving mirrors in his shoes. It was big news when he got on 20/20 or 60 minutes (one of the big news programs) just to show that he could actually moonwalk. Primetime television over a dance-move.",1647348343.0,293

He even had his own video games based off of the Moonwalker movie. To put it plainly, his popularity and influence was IMMENSE, and still is, to this day.",1647360895.0,2

I don't even know if I'd say Thriller was his peak, I think it might have been Bad, the next album. I was a bit too young for thriller, although even then I was aware of it but as big as he was I think Bad cemented it. Around the same time we got Moonwalker, which I got to see in the cinema and one of the first Megadrive games I owned was a Japanese copy of the Moonwalker game.

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyoncé with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded. This century it seems more like songs have a very brief shelf life and peak after a few weeks and then vanish",1647359296.0,2

Just about everyone, everywhere knew who he was whether or not they listened to his music, and that's including Soviet bloc countries where Western music was often censored.

It's worth noting that this popularity was even more intense among black Americans, in some cases, because of genre(s) and what he represented to a marginalized community. Before he went solo Jackson was already a black soul icon thanks to The Jackson 5, and his best albums were produced by Quincy Jones, a legendary black producer and musician in his own right.

There was a show that aired after school called TRL (total request live) on MTV that would play a count down of the top music videos. It was super popular until reality TV took over the music video channels. The radio was huge, music videos played off that, then once the internet started picking up and people could find new artists through that, it started to kill off the radio and music videos. 

The Buggles has a song called video killed the radio star, which is spot on. To be big during that time, you had to have a music video. But then, the internet made access to music easier for everyone and now people can find any genre they like. In my opinion it opened the gates to both echo chambers (listening only to the same genre all the time) and widening people’s tastes as it is now easier to find new artists.

Truly, you have a terrific mind. Anyway, MJ was the original MJ (sorry #23). He wasn’t just popular, he had all of the popularity and it’s literally impossible to imagine without having experienced it. That’s a horrible answer, but it’s true. For several years he *was* pop culture. I hadn’t thought about this in forever but as soon as I saw your post I flashed back to several vivid memories of things like the Walkman that kept his tapes piping into my earholes, people wearing one sequined glove and very specifically-studded red leather jackets. Everywhere, all the time. The first POC on MTV. That was huuuge. The Beatles were big, maybe bigger than Jesus as they claimed. By comparison, MJ was bigger than god for a few years before fading slowly as times changed and he didn’t adapt in a way that resonated very well. He was still huge but as he was no longer defining culture, it seemed like he was increasingly lost in the tall grass. Then he spiraled and it was viscerally unsettling. “Cringey” doesn’t even come close to describing the phenomenon. This was still before the allegations of him doing… idk, whatever the hell he was doing at the ranch. His videos, which were packaged as equally significant as his singles, just got disturbing in an “uncanny valley” kind of way. He didn’t seem entirely human anymore and he kept drifting away from being relatable in any way. There wasn’t nostalgia for at least a decade after Thriller, if not longer. When I hear one of those classic songs now, it’s like a gift. I don’t queue him up on streaming services. I don’t think of it. It’s probably because I discovered a love for music by people like Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and even Parliament.
I think that music resonates more and feels timeless. It scratches that itch that I’d otherwise get for MJ. At MJ’s peak, though, he stood higher than anyone. No one’s been there since.

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn’t listen or watch the video because of “satan”. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church “dances’.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20’s at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that’s come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn’t miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ’s life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That’s fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you’ll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince’s unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It’s like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn’t exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don’t really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

The technical internet as we know it may have started in 1983, but it was nothing like it was between 1994 - 1996. BBS dialup was NOT readily accessible to most people outside of a rare few entitled and wealthy kids who could not only afford the seemingly impossibly priced hardware and modems, but the M-----F---ing AT&T charges for a long distance call to said BBS systems. It was ALLL dialup, no one could afford a Digital Subscriber Line, and the load time for BBS was crazy. The invention of better, inexpensive IBM clone hardware combined with improved GUIs and browsers changed everything, and that was the mid-90s. I assure you no one was getting their music info from online but the top 1% of the 1%.

The bulk of cultural impact was measured in TV ratings, *pulp magazine sales,* newspapers sold, and radio airtime. Magazines played a much larger role in music and pop culture than at any previous point in history, because the news stand basically was the internet before the internet, which is why the magazine racks are a shell of their former selves and news print media is damn near extinct since the birth of the real internet in the mid-to-late 1990s.",1647361714.0,3

A lot of people just want to hear the big songs on the newer Albums and that's it. If you bought a record back in the 80s, it wasn't cheap. If you or your family bought it, you were going to listen to all of it, probably multiple times. They were $7.50-$10/ piece back then, so comparable to $26-$30 today's price after inflation. We wouldn't even pay that for a CD nowadays.

People got their music from the Radio, TV/ MTV (when they actually played music), or a Record/ Cassette that someone had purchased. That was basically it for the normal person.

Joe Manchin, for all his faults and ties to energy, has spoken out against Russia.

""Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said that as the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election continue, it's important to note that Russia is not an ally.""Russia is not our friend. And to treat Putin as an ally and a friend is wrong. I don't look at him as a friend. I don't look at Russia. And I am very skeptical of what they're doing, their intentions. There are a lot of good people in Russia that don't have any say whatsoever,"" Manchin said on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.""  


Tulsi however is fully bought.

I put my estimate for Trumps weight based on a BMI visualizer. I think the visualizer assumes little to no muscular definition.

So it makes *no* sense.

**Edit: JFC people** - I get that it makes sense for Russia to do it as a bullshit tactic to continue spreading misinformation (their modus operandi). I fucking get it and know that. My comment about it not making sense is in terms of, well, the reality that she doesn't work for the government. As far as further evidence he hates her and supporting Trump's bullshit and doing it as a propaganda bomb - yes, it does make sense.

Soft power has isolated Russia so much they're fucked just trying to take Ukraine. Russia might fall apart without NATO ever putting boots on the ground.

I also feel that this viewpoint probably became popularized in Russia because it became the key way to make sure the old guard remained in power indefinitely.

It will be more and more difficult for Russian citizens to hear or believe the truth of what's going on.

The same thing happened in Nazi Germany, when it was isolated and under an umbrella of extremely effective propaganda.   

This is long, but worth reading. It is an excerpt from *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.* The author explains how he, even though he knows the truth, felt like he was going nuts surrounded by so many brainwashed people. It happens. **Propaganda works.**

>I myself was to experience how easily one is taken in by a lying and censored press and radio in a totalitarian state. 

>Though unlike most Germans I had daily access to foreign newspapers, especially those of London, Paris, and Zurich, which arrived the day after publication, and though I listened regularly to the BBC and other foreign broadcasts, my job necessitated the spending of many hours a day in combing the German press, checking the German radio, conferring with Nazi officials and going to party meetings. 

>**It was surprising and sometimes consternating to find that notwithstanding the opportunities I had to learn the facts and despite one's inherent distrust of what one learned from Nazi sources, a steady diet over the years of falsifications and distortions made a certain impression on one's mind and often misled it.** No one who has not lived for years in a totalitarian land can possibly conceive how difficult it is to escape the dread consequences of a regime's calculated and incessant propaganda. 

>Often in a German home or office or sometimes in a casual conversation with a stranger in a restaurant, a beer hall, a cafe, I would meet with the most outlandish assertions from seemingly educated and intelligent persons. **It was obvious that they were parroting some piece of nonsense they had heard on the radio or read in the newspapers.** 

>Sometimes one was tempted to say as much, **but on such occasions one was met with such a stare of incredulity, such a shock of silence, as if one had blasphemed the Almighty, that one realized how useless it was even to try to make contact with a mind which had become warped** and for whom the facts of life had become what Hitler and Goebbels, with their cynical disregard for truth, said they were.

Not sure if it would be a good idea.

If the only way Russians could make money if they protest. We could just pay every fine any protester in the country faces. Would maybe incentive people to protest more. They still face prison but there isn't much we can do about that.

Unfortunately it's would probably be abused and Russian would claim the money somehow.

Also from a propaganda view we would don't want to give Putin ammo that the West is paying people to disrupt the country. Would play straight into his propaganda machine

The number people they have killed or jailed is still far less than the people they haven't killed or jailed. 

The largely English speaking population of Reddit only knows of these events through articles that occasionally pop up on /r/worldnews. Remember, you won't see an article titles ""Putin does nothing to journalist that opposed him"" on reddit, except for maybe today.

There is a major, glaring, disconnect here between what Redditors think Russia is like, and what it's really like. None of this is to say press freedom is alive, and being a member of the opposition is good for one's health in Russia. However, the Reddit mindset of ""oh, they looked at Putin wrong, they dead now"" is way off base, and there would have been a revolution in Russia long ago if that was the case.

For all of the stupid shit Putin has done recently, he has still historically been meticulous and calculating. He didn't become as unchallenged and powerful as he is overnight, and he didn't do it by literally killing everyone that opposes him. He has only targeted key people who he could silence and get away with, and only when they posed a perceived threat to him.

In this scenario, silencing her would do far more harm than good. And that doesn't mean she'll get killed in a week or two either - believe it or not Russians do have this little thing called ""memory"".

People commenting shit bellow like ""Putin never forgets"", like he's some fucking elephant, are so disconnected from the real world it's hilarious. He's a dictator who's been responsible for the deaths of thousands, but he's not some fucking comic book villain who is literally every single evil thing you can think of at once. He's a real person, running a real (authoritarian) government.

More likely than anything, Putins regime will keep her alive, maybe try to attack her character, but most importantly... They'll point to all of the comments by people like the average redditors, and now the UN, and say ""look how ridiculous these people are, she's still alive and was never at risk"".",1647367838.0,10

Nobody has mentioned removing sanctions for their sake, and nobody was talking about it when she did this either, until the conspiracy theory that it was a psyop got going. If lifting sanctions was her goal, her FB video would at least have mentioned them or made some artful reference to how hard everything is right now or money problems or something. She didn't do that. She said that Putin started the war, that she had lied and covered up facts about the initial invasion, Navalny's poisoning, and so on. Nothing about money or sanctions.

To be fair, the current situation is *way* milder than, say, the '92-'96 period, where stores couldn't operate because the bulk prices were increasing by 20% throughout the day. That's what hyperinflation looks like, and why it's devastating to an economy on so many levels.

It's only been a few weeks, but outside of imported stuff now costing way more (and a lot of categories are straight up not available anymore due to sanctions, like computer equipment), everything else remains largely stable. If Putin is somehow deposed within a month, the new government might have some semblance of an economy to work with, but if it doesn't happen by the summer, the hyperinflation will almost surely kick in and everything will rapidly go to shit. Whoever has any savings now will try to exchange it for useful products (whatever's still available) before that happens.

And I always remember the anecdote of one of my friends who paid off a 3-year car loan in 2 months during the '98 default and subsequent hyperinflation. It turns out that as long as you have a job and your salary keeps up with inflation rates, it's downright beneficial to get into debt before shit hits the fan.",1647369038.0,2

Then, he wants to act like he's the bigger person by ""Not getting drawn into this war.""

Except does that make any sense at all? Why on earth would Ukraine **want** to draw Belarus into attacking them? Ukraine isn't on the offensive here, they're fighting a purely defensive war, the **last** thing they want is to draw in a new attacker while also jeopardizing their global good will by committing an act of aggression. If they HAD long range missile capable of an attack like that, what possible reason would Ukraine have for launching them at Belarus, and not Russia, or the occupying Russian forces?

It does, however, make sense for *Russia* to have secretly fired that missile, especially if done from Ukrainian territory. Then, they can say they that not only are they such good allies of Belarus for helping stop this one missile, but that obviously Ukraine is a threat and they must join forces to stop them.

It's a classic False Flag attack, one of many we're likely to see from Russia as their position gets more and more tenuous.

> Alexander Lukashenko, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, says that the country has been hit by a Point-U missile, but says he is &quot;Not going to&quot; take part in the war and has &quot;Not been asked to join it&quot;.

> As a confirmation, just two days ago at night another Point-U missile was launched at the territory of our Belarus, which we together with Russians successfully intercepted and destroyed over Pripyat.

> The Ukrainian air defence system shot down a missile fired from the territory of Belarus in Kyiv.

Also why would Ukraine attack Belarus just a random one time? And Ukraine wouldn’t target residential areas in Belarus if they did attack, they’d be attacking supply lines or military bases in order to hinder Russia. So the attacks even more so don’t make any sense 

Lastly Belarus supplying and housing Russia is *not* enough justification for Ukraine to even attack them. Otherwise Russia would be hitting Poland which is doing the same for Ukraine

[Putin takes Deripaska to task](https://youtu.be/48Kk7kobMQY)

What's with the narration? Why is everybody on the other side of the table? Oh... I get it. The whole thing's bullshit.""

 >Human mortality from H5N1 or the human fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 refer to the ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern due to the global spread of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia.

While I do think there are some animated movies that don't need a remaster (mainly most Disney movies from the golden era) I do think some deserve that treatment. Shrek is one of them. Even if you look at Shrek 2, it looks way better than the first.

Some classics were dealt rough hands, As you mentioned Toy Story, When the 3rd movie came out and it ""ended"" I thought it would be great if they remastered the 1st in the style of the 3rd. 

We've seen it in games, a remaster of an old classic with a modern update. Some movies deserve that treatment. Though choosing which ones get that is a tough choice, for example I don't think we need to touch up The Lion King or Lilo and Stitch but others may disagree.

My friends and I have quoted it since the day we saw it in theaters...and then bought the DVD to set on continuous replay on the home TV.

Go to my friend's house and the TV is off? Hit ""Power"" and Kung Pow is already playing.

Walk in the door? 
""Weee-oooo-weeee-oooooo-weeee!""

Come in from the pool?
""We intentionally trained him wrong as a joke.""

Come up stairs from the gaming TV with Street Fighter or DDR?
""OK. So here were my options. A. Quickly duck sideways, dodge the claw, then take him out with a spinning back-kick or... B. Take the claw in the face then roll on the ground and die. ""
::WHACK::
""Mmmm, should have gone with A.

And my buddies' dad loved it.

Hell, any person I've befriended, no matter their personal interests, have loved Kung Pow once introduced.

Its continually play time was only usurped 2 years later when Napoleon Dynamite came out.

I had to do some serious soul-searching when my buddy's parents moved a few years later. That place was everyone's home.

And to give props to my best friend's dad, He's the first person who made me realize that adults don't really grow up. They still love poop jokes, juvenile humor, dumb movies, and playing ping pong or basketball for hours. Most adults are still kids in their hearts, they just had to learn to balance responsibility so the next generation were free to laugh, explore, and be ornery.",1647371517.0,1

The parts of the movie where original scenes were added, like the cow, or the 1 boob woman, were too much. Trying too hard and too cheesy. The re-dubbed bits totally make up for that though.

Everyone here is writing other factors that may contribute to depression. But COVID-triggered depression is weird or, better stated, different on it own.

The big difference between both is that, and this is anecdotal, the first one, it’s kinda just degenerating state over time that you can back track from traumatic events, but covid-triggered is way different it is like you are one person and then just like that you are grey (to me it took just about 1 week to descend into a depressed state) it just happens. 

I had a not severe, mostly asymptomatic case. But one of my doctor’s colleagues committed suicide after a two week severe case, recovering and months of treatment for depression (at the moment diagnosed as PTSD).

This virus is a new critter and behaving in different ways than what we've previously seen in common viruses. People talk about mortality and hospitalization as the major endpoints for consideration, but as many here have attested (and the study in question demonstrates), cognitive and emotional sequelae are prominent, even in “mild” cases.

Many key limbic and paralimbic structures are affected with COVID: orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate, temporal pole, insula, and amygdala. If this bears out, it is no surprise whatsoever that people are experiencing increased anxiety, depression, and worse. Those structures are directly related to emotion and regulation of emotion.

I will say, as an anecdote, that when I thought I had all the symptoms of depression and asked my doctor about it, it turned out that my vitamin D was on the floor (Below 30 ng/dl is considered deficient - mine was 12 ng/dl.  That's definitely the point at which it becomes symptomatic.)

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.  

ICU delirium significantly contributes to injuries in the hospital setting and increased length of hospitalization and can result in PTSD, depression, and personality and/or memory changes that persist after the hospitalization is over and delirium has resolved.",1647360852.0,29

Say what you will about some of the terminology used in this description of the ""pain body"" which really resonates with me, but in my experience, this has been useful.

A tl;dr version could be: hurt people hurt people (including themselves)

Or: misery loves company.

""
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, “become you,” and live through you. It needs to get its “food” through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. 

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn’t really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane. 

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don’t face it, if you don’t bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn’t make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth — that is, make it real in your own experience. 

So the pain-body doesn’t want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength.""",1647367015.0,4

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

I can't find the link (lots of other stuff comes up) but researchers did MRIs during sex and found that the penis doesn't go in a vagina and stay straight, it bends about 60-90 degrees (upward in missionary).

So I’m not shocked the 80s found nothing wrong with stalking as a whole. 

The other thing is that they write women as one dimensional irrational tools for the story. “It’s not what it looks like!” As a 2 hour long explanation of how to prove to their wife that “it’s not what it seems” because women are irrational and can’t be talked to. 

I never watched romcoms as a young teen because I didn’t like the plots. Now as an adult, I understand why I didn’t like the plots. 

Raunchy comedy has the same issue. Superbad literally pioneered consent in film. I remember Comedy Central playing a comedy where a man was raped while sleeping by a woman and his girlfriend walks in, and assumes he’s cheating on her. He was literally blacked out drunk and was raped on screen and this was “comedy”. No wonder so many millennial men hate women and can’t figure out how to date them, when their formative teenage years was filled with this trash or anime. Neither of which are particularly great at displaying that women are humans.

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape. I can’t help but wonder why this is even an option when someone reports sexual assault, in the same way I wonder why so many men think stalking is a way to win a woman back.

In an era in which action against collective entities was discouraged among the general populace (e.g. a few hundred years ago), but action against individuals was encouraged (e.g. physical fights and duelings seen as legal), this might reverse.

Heck, it might even reverse in the USA less then 100 years ago when lynchings were de facto legal and unionization efforts scorned as communistic or otherwise un-American.

A good point brought up below was social media, which could be a societal reversion to a more balanced ability to act against both collective entities and individuals. OTOH social media also makes it easier for others to act against you, which might create a counter-balance away from individual enmity, as being hostile to an individual psychologically increases the thought that people will be hostile towards you.

Lots of stuff is wrong in Canada, for lots of reasons. Can we really not acknowledge that we’re not always right? Must every political conversation result in a purity test? Is it possible that good public policy is a moving target?

The issue is ideological rigidity. A complete lack of will to even entertain alternatives.

On one side is truckers who refuse to acknowledge their protest did attract neo-Nazis, confederates, conspiracy nuts, and other anti-democratic assholes.

On the other is a government that refuses to acknowledge the distrust, whether founded in reality or not, that comes from a seemingly inconsistent and arbitrary Corona response.

Only by accepting that we are sometimes wrong and being willing to change course can we actually improve. Acting as if we have the answer and everyone else is wrong leads nowhere.

But the idea is that *anyone* comes with a big caveat. Anyone can be creative *if* they use a Western definition and practice of creativity. Perhaps not surprisingly, the field’s literature rejected Soviet creativity in its 1950s-70s rhetoric, at which point it switched over to…Chinese. Shocking, right? Since the 80s, they’ve targeted Confucianism as being a cultural inhibitor of creativity. It’s important to remember that the modern “creativity” came directly out of the advertising and organizational psychology fields, and they take shots at everyone—including artists—if their expressions of creativity aren’t perceived as having economic utility. Also, they’re a delusional bunch, who are itching for a race race war. Here’s a choice line from Sidney Parnes’ 1988 *Visionizing*:

“The future of man is surrounded with perplexing question marks and tragic conflicts. The process of evolution and natural selection may not allow for harmonization. Man may be at the crossroads. He may be forced to live and survive in two different environments: one, the natural environment in which his freedom as a biological being, the function of the creator, is the most supreme criterion; and the other, a technological automatic, or better said, a conserved and conserving environment in which his freedom and his creative function are restrained and forced to flow between the bedrock of mechanical evolution. Races of men fit for the one may be unfit for the other. The criteria of unfitness are different in both environments. One line of evolution may lead inescapably to societies of men similar to societies of insects, harmonious and 100 percent efficient but unindividualistic. The other line of evolution may lead inescapably to a new race of men who tacitly will follow the direction of their ascendance up to date, modified and enhanced by the triumph over the robot (p. 345)”

My Bruce Campbell experience - met him at comicon and asked him a question about an obscure TV show he did called ‘The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.’ just to hit him up with a question he maybe didn’t hear before. I asked him ‘what was it like to ride that rocket on the railway?’ and he went on to say how fun it was because it was a real practical effect and he actually was riding this contraption. I already knew that because I watched the special features on the DVD box set but my friend and I were both in awe that Bruce Campbell was talking to us and giving us an enthusiastic answer.

night, there was a ""UFO special"" on Fox after Brisco County, the third   
Friday night, Sept. 10, 1993, The X-Files started its run.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick   
took over and our interest started to wane.",1647359676.0,3

I'm not sure if the character would have worked well in the lead. The movie they did was good enough, but weekly plots where Sam has to pull the weight of the narrative every time? Half the character's charm is that he scarcely ever gives a shit and is game for hijinks basically whenever, but a lead character has to be more invested than that.

Sam Axe has a constant ""I just wanna' go home"" energy whenever he's the focus of the plot, which is fantastic in short bursts, but wouldn't hold up to scrutiny in a spinoff where he's the perpetual focus. Character would have to change a lot to support it.",1647362283.0,8

The creator has stated he wanted a more serial show, with the end of one episode jumping into a wormhole leading to the next. Instead, they would start each episode with a couple of lines of bullshit about 'hey, that last world was wacky, eh?"" and everything resets each episode with almost no continuity. 

The network also pushed for more interpersonal conflict and the cromags as a 'big bad guy'. They drove the professor out & replaced him with a playboy playmate.

From what I understand (not a horse expert) horses don't do this today because 1) they're trained to be more used to cars, and 2) the equipment they make them wear when they're on a road where they might see a car usually prevents them looking anywhere but right in front of them, so they often don't see the cars moving.

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?

New Zealand began exporting the fruit to the US in the 1950s. This was the height of the Cold War and the term Chinese gooseberry was a marketing nightmare for Turners and Growers.

In June 1959, Jack Turner suggested the name kiwifruit during a Turners and Growers management meeting in Auckland. His idea was adopted and this later became the industry-wide name.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

What that means is, they are tracking the aircraft with a radar.  The SAM follows the radar beam up to the aircraft.  The Wild Weasel flies around waiting for radar lock from a SAM launcher.  When the SAM launcher gets radar lock, the Wild Weasel also fires a missile (HARM - High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile) that follows the radar beam down to the launcher.  The bet is that the HARM blows up the launcher before the SAM hits the Wild Weasel.  Without the radar beam the SAM misses.

Same as Combat Air Patrol pilots actively want enemy fighters to engage them so that they can shoot them down.

To add to this, counter AA technology NEEDS you to be targeted to counter them

In electronic warfare. The pilot needs the AA battery to turn their RF systems on (like radar and RF guidance for missiles) to geolocate their position, submit it to the rest of the forces, then counter attack *likely before the AA battery even fires*

HARM missiles are basically automatically locked when you have a radar lock on you and you just press a button pointed in the right direction and it guides itself to the AA battery that's targeting you",1647346122.0,6

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular. After all, NATO, the side with all this hyped-up 'dedicated platforms', still had a hell of a time avoiding losses to obsolete Soviet SAM systems over Yugoslavia",1647343051.0,1

He flew un-manned drones towards these sites, and the Iraqis, thinking they were American f-15s and 16s, turned on their radars and fired.

US and NATO pilots tend to have an average of 200 flight hours per year, while Russian pilots only get somewhere between 60-100. The US and NATO pilots use that extra flight time to train on stuff like SEAD.

The US and NATO Airforces train for SEAD missions as well as using dedicated SEAD aircraft or training with dedicated EW platforms. And they have long operational histories of using said training in combat.

At least some of the torpedo bombers had air cover. The problem was that the technique the USN was using at the time sucked.  
Some examples:   
The Enterprises fighter squadron VF-6 was providing cover for Hornets torpedo squadron VT-8 (VF-6 had lost the group of planes it was intended to cover and had basically 'latched' onto VF-8 instead). The issue was that the USN plan was to fly ""high cover"", so the USN fighters were high and the bombers were low, and as a result the USN fighters didn't do much (anything?) to interfere with the Zeros.  
When Enterprises torpedo squadron came in while VF-6 was still in the air and still ineffective.  
Yorktown's strike actually came in together, with the fighters (VF-3), bombers (VB-3) and torpedo aircraft (VT-3) arriving together. They went in as a single strike but one of the ways Japan had of dealing with their CAP being drawn away was keeping 'ready' aircraft on the decks which could be launched to respond to new threats, so by the time they came in the USN fighters were massively overmatched in number (6 USN fighters vs 40+ IJN fighters). VT-3 was also screwed in that they ran headfirst into the fighters chasing down the departing survivors of VT-6. 
  
> The Devastators drew the carrier's Zero cover downwards and they didn't have time to regain altitude when the other bombers arrived.  
  
VT-6 was also the only squadron that really had any effect at drawing the cover downwards, as they actually went in with other attacks. The other torpedo attacks were so early that there was plenty of time for the Japanese CAP to return to altitude. The idea of VT-8 (or VT-6) bravely sacrificing themselves to draw the CAP down is a myth that was created to try and pin a purpose to the slaughter of the torpedo squadron.",1647360789.0,2

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week.

NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

Their jets are not flying with the targeting pods required for SEAD missions, supposedly because they don't have enough of them. And they have a huge shortage in guided munitions, defaulting to ineffective dumb bombs. And they haven't really been using their anti-radiation missiles much. Their operations in Syria mostly relied on unguided munitions. A lot of us assumed that it was just Russia not giving a shit. But looking at Ukraine it becomes obvious that when fighting someone with the right equipment, guided munitions is the difference between a successful strike from a jet at high altitude and missing your target with unguided bombs dropped from a low altitude, exposing you to both enemy fighters and MANPADs.

It's showing us that Russia has never really changed from the Soviet era. Most of their power comes from propaganda. They had the world convinced that Russia had near peer capabilities and tech. In reality their most recent hardware/tech is completely absent in a disastrous war that they're losing. And their military tactics echo early Cold War era tactics and are completely useless against today's technology. It's the equivalent of leading an infantry charge into trenches full of machine guns.

As for why they haven’t equipped drones with HARMs, I’m not actually sure — Israel, India, and Turkey use the IAI Harop/Harpy 2 which is a loitering SEAD platform, so it stands to reason it’s well within US capabilities.

SFOD-A: A Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or ""A-Teams""). Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO, high altitude low opening), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.).

The movie [12 Strong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong) which is based on reporting by [Gary Schroen depicts their role either as forward observers, trainers, or other operational activities.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Schroen)

The CIA needed ODA teams on the ground to direct airstrikes. 12 strong illustrates roughly how that was done, including coordination with the CIA to bribe local warlords and removing MANPADS with large amounts of cash from Afghanistan.

SFOD-B: The ODB, or ""B-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11–13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field.

Note: Any time you read ""direct"", picture in your head shooting at the enemy. Direct fire = point and shoot. Indirect fire = artillery, mortars, fire from an unseen adversary.

SFOD-C: The SFODC, or ""C-Team"", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals, and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies.

SFOD-D: SFOD-D, or Delta Force is comprised of soldiers recruited from within the US Army's 75th Ranger's Regiment and the other occupational detachments. Strong focus on counter terrorism, clandestine operations. Generally works closely with the CIA's SAC/SOG.

Suffice it to say, Delta force are usually made up of former Green Berets. Functionally, due to the expected clandestine nature of their role they are separate but SFOD-A/B/C/D are all still under the command of JSOC and USSOCOM.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.

The pilot would bet that the SAM operator would shut down without waiting to fire back or confirm incoming for fear of an incoming HARM, and it turns out they were actually right - SAM crews would disengage if they heard that there might be a HARM fired at them.

If the missile was ineffective, it wouldn't elicit that kind of respect from the enemy. And the fact that that worked is in itself HARM being effective - It disabled enemy air defenses, even temporarily, to defend allied aircraft, without even actually being on the battlefield.",1647359303.0,5

We're still having this conversation 70 years later because that ethical consideration has only become more severe and we're only recently starting to reach a point where the technology can offset that.
