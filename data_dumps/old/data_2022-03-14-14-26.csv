‚ÄúOne of the five definitions in Dr. Williams‚Äô study is similar to the reasoning behind the TikTok: It‚Äôs based off of the idea that PoP = C x A. In that case, ""C"" means the confidence that it‚Äôll rain somewhere in the forecast area. And ""A"" means the percent of the area that will receive a measurable amount of rain, if it occurs at all. So a 50% chance of rain in 80% of a given area = a 40% PoP.

Greeting a platonic friend with a kiss was not sexual at the time. But Jesus knew what was happening,  which is why he looks disgusted and Judas has a sneer on his face. (These pictures are still inaccurate as they are super racist, by picturing Judas as being of darker skin and hair. )

""to betray with a kiss"" is a saying for this reason. 

FYI - the anti homosexuality rhetoric comes  from Leviticus in the old testament and some of Paul's letters in the new testament.  

Leviticus is full of purification laws that that 99% of Christians do not follow anyway and the bit about homosexuality being a sin may have been a mistranslated and is actually forbidding pedophilia,  which was very common between bosses and apprentices  in Greece at the time. 

Paul also makes it clear every time that he talks about homosexuality, that he lumps it in with other sexual sins, eg sex before marriage, cheating on your spouse etc.  and that he thinks it's something that a person can change about themselves.  He claims to have known people who were  no longer like that.  ( Which could have easily been bi people who now had heterosexual relationships or gay people who became celibate.)

The current focus on anti-homosexuality as the ""worst sin"",  especially to the extent that someone might disown their child,  is modern and completely against the teachings of Jesus.

(2) Unless it was for a portrait, even Renaissance paintings often used stock faces and postures, so repetition was common.  There is a ""Crippled beggar"" that basically is copypasta-ed across the Renaissance oeuvre.

(3) People often had much more restrictive ideas of personal space than we do.  People being close together was not the indicator of romantic intimacy we treat it as.  Often, other signs were used to indicate romantic intimacy

(4) Public demonstrations of closeness were often used to make a point to the viewers, not to get a sexual smooch.  Kissing or hugging someone was a way to say  ""This person and I are closer than they are with you, so I have more worth"", not to say ""We shag all the time""

(5) Implying Christ was homosexual was straight up heresy - and they tied people to posts and lit them on fire for less.  Even implying Christ like a good pegging was a one-way trip to a BBQ where you were the pig.  And all of the Renaissance painters were massively Catholic living in Catholic nations.  They were not going to risk serious punishments even if they did think Jesus and Judas got it on.

(6) This isn't to say there were no homosexual men in either Antiquity or the Renaissance, but using modern homosexual signifiers doesn't translate as seamlessly as you are implying.

Gene LeBell (who was a stunt coordinator for the movie) heard about the claim, and allegedly gave Seagal the opportunity to prove it. LeBell is said to have placed his arms around Seagal's neck, and once Seagal said ""go"", proceeded to choke him unconscious, with Seagal violently evacuating his bowels in the process.[5] After refusing to comment for many years, LeBell circumspectly referred to the story in 2012 when questioned on the matter in an interview; some outlets chose to consider this ""confirmation"" of the story, despite LeBell refusing to directly comment.[6]

My priests were lovely. Couldn‚Äôt fiddle kids because there just wouldn‚Äôt have been time in the day with all of the actual humanitarian work they had going. If they had been bad people. 

I remember once being 14, drunk, at a house party at 2am where I felt uncomfortable. I couldn‚Äôt call my mother, because I lied about where I was that night and didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. 

I needed to get home but had no idea who to call. For some reason I had my youth pastors number, even though I had only gone to youth services once or twice. 

I called him and drunk explained; and he was there in 5 minutes, in sweatpants and clearly just out of sleeping. 

He went through the drive through coffee place and got me a coffee and then talked with me on the 30 minute ride to my parents house. 

It never once felt judgmental. We didn‚Äôt talk about god or the Bible per say. 

When I apologized for calling him (despite hardly knowing him) and cried for feeling bad, and cried that my moms Jewish, so I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm allowed to ask his help, he nicely told me that it didn‚Äôt matter how often I skipped church. Or youth group or if I believed in anything, Old Testament or new. 

That he took the job because he wanted to prove God in the way he was meant to; by being a Good Samaritan and caring about people. And he didn‚Äôt mind losing sleep, because bringing me home safely was what Catholicism is about; doing the right thing. 

He never brought it up again, but when I saw him he would greet me warmly and ask how I was. Even if I was a random kid off the street that didn‚Äôt have a religion really. 

Some people are just called for that kind of work, and don‚Äôt mind living poor and doing good things for no return. They actually practice what they preach.

As often, it's somewhere between the two. The French Revolution went for 10 years, people change during these years, and some like Robespierre were very reserved so it's hard to know exactly what they had in mind. Also it's such an important event in France's history with such important people, who were praised or vilified depending of which French government was in charge, with so many myths and mysteries, that it is very hard for historians to know what is true and what is not. What was their exact role ? To which degree were they at fault ? For example, there is still a debate about the role of Robespierre in the Vendee genocide. Did he really ordered it himself or was it the generals who went too far ?  Did Marie-Antoinette reveal sensible information to her family in Austria, making her a traitor ? Who was really responsible for the Terror (because Robespierre wasn't the only one in the Public Safety Comitee and the National Assembly...). There was a lot of corruption in the National Assembly, where people often changed sides according to their interests or because of fear. It's a really interesting period to learn about.

Non-French people only know Robespierre because he's the most famous and think he was in charge of everything, but there were other important people (Danton, Desmoulins, Saint-Just, Barras, Couthon, H√©bert, Marat, Fouquier-Tinville, etc) who also played a big role and made decisions leading to the Terror, but who are unheard of in other countries.

That was the de Gaulle fiction created after WW2. Once all the details were unfolded it was pretty clear France had collaborated heavily at every level. The choice was made by de Gaulle to more or less establish a fictional history because his alternative was to mass produce guillotines to kill millions of traitors.

Literally on de Gaulle's death the historians of France all pulled hidden histories from under the bed to say ""actually shit didn't work like that"". A lot of WW2 understanding is basically torn between the propaganda fictions of the time and historians trying to put together an accurate understanding of what went on.

That‚Äôs Alan watts.  I was in a very very low place ( actually many times, and there will probably be many more times) and I truly felt like I didn‚Äôt have anything to live for. I eventually came across this quote. It didn‚Äôt make things better, just made me realize the truth about this life. 

There‚Äôs no purpose. somehow we are all here doing whatever the fuck we‚Äôre doing. I think of us as ants. Busy bees like we are all always on own own missions. But fuck that. Fuck standards or what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be doing or what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be stressing about and just fucking do what ever feels right to you. Like now. I know that we all have some thing that makes us tick. I like to be in nature. I like the feeling in the sun on my skin. I like looking at rocks. I like thinking about how different rocks are formed. I like finding cool rocks or crystals and thinking about how many years it took for them to be made and then how many more years it took for me to find it. 

Conclusion is life‚Äôs about rocks. 

No but really it‚Äôs just about doing whatever makes you happy and truly, like truly to your core just saying fuck it to everything that you don‚Äôt care about and doesn‚Äôt make you happy. And if you feel like there‚Äôs nothing that makes you happy you‚Äôre looking at it too broadly and you just in a bad mindset at the moment. And probably feeling the pressure of the way society make us feel like we should always be doing more. 

Truly, lifes happiness in the little things. Go find your little things. And don‚Äôt start to make excuses; ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just not that simple‚Äù - bc, yes it really is that simple. It‚Äôs so fucking simple we overlook how simple it really is.

Everything would cause panic attacks. Driving, walking a certain distance from my home, taking the bus. My brain had destroyed the ""off switch"" and rebuilding would take years.

My parents were beside me when I had my first panic attack.  It felt like I couldn't go anywhere, but still  I wanted to escape it. (If that makes sense) Then afterwards it was like I had lost the function to relax, even breathing properly was difficult for many years.

As the months went by I got ""better"" at making the panic attacks not as obvious on the outside. But on the inside, it felt like my body was super tight, and in my head it felt like I was looking at a movie of my life. I were observing from the outside. I knew it was silly having panic attacks, but I couldn't find the ""off switch"".

I struggled with higher education and getting jobs, and my parents thought I were just ""being lazy, sitting on my computer doing nothing"". They didn't thought it was such a big deal, because they couldn't see it/experience it. ""Why not just quit it, because it's easy for me"". Then my wider family also started to get aggressive with me. Like even if I explained it, it seemed everyone thought ""it wasn't a big deal"" or something.

Everything is (almost) back to normal now. I've really worked to gain back my mental/physical muscles. I've got a new job and things start to go upwards.

I believe you should too; I know the pessimist that usually follows depression and self-hatred makes you think this is just empty platitudes from strangers on the internet, but believe that this(and other comments) are heartfelt and real.

I guarantee the boys in middle school and high school that looked so smooth asking girls out, were either faking it, or they had enough experience getting rejected that they were bulletproof by that point.

My dad told me, ""don't stress about asking your crush out. They can only say yes or no. If you realize that what you are doing is basically saying, 'hey I like you, let's see if that has any substance', then you realize that rejection is actually worse for the person who rejected you. You are practicing the habit of opening doors and creating relationships, they just practiced closing doors and isolation.""

It took me another 20 years of getting rejected, and accepted, in so many different contexts, to realize he was being 100% honest. These days, if I have a crush at all, I don't beat around the bush, that just wastes time, and if you aren't cruel about the rejection, then we can work on a platonic friendship, and I have more time to find a new crush that may actually find me attractive.

Don't waste your time, and potentially the other person's time. Just ask. It's far better to *know* where you stand, than it is to hold on to a fantasy, that over time will become the pillar you stick your idealized version of that person on top of. 

Also if they say yes, then you get to have more time as a couple.

If they reject you, that isn't your loss. It is theirs, because they aren't rejecting *you*. They can't because they never took the time to get to know you. They are rejecting their idea of you, and that is pretty sad for them.",1647272713.0,8

It may be time to examine the deeper reasons why each marriage didn't work. Try to view it as a team effort that failed and try to identify where each team member could have done better. (Unless one partner cheated, then that's another issue.)

 Your own weaknesses are fixable, basically no matter what. It just takes a lot of introspection.

Another great quote of his, ""We would accomplish many more things if we did not think of them as impossible"".

On a personal note, mistakes are often the most important vectors in personal growth. Unfortunately, humans aren't very good at learning from others' mistakes. Playing guitar which is an artistic endeavor could benefit from thinking outside the box... Paul McCartney can't read music and is self taught on nearly a dozen instruments he's played on records and if you just listen to the music they were doing shit nobody had ever really done before because they had no classical training and they were experimenting so much (with different types of music as well as the drugs). There's something to be said for getting down the basics before you start getting too experimental though and you can definitely ""waste"" practice time by not being efficient with your time/energy. The first example that comes to mind is studying for a test in college, you can read the entire book OR you could pick out the 25-40 bold/italicized words and write them down with their definitions. Everyone is a little different obviously, but in general the latter will be much more successful and take much less time. I had to teach several of my friends how to study back in college because they would do shit like take an Adderall to read 4-5 chapters of a science textbook the night before the test then be confused as to why they did poorly and I made an A while studying for maybe 30-45 minutes. It's strange trying to convince people you aren't as smart as they think you are, that you just found a few tricks to make memorizing information easier. Having said all that, it would be best to take full advantage of any opportunity and treat every subject like it's really interesting so you'll actually be able to learn and retain that information for the long term. I definitely wish I had more of that kind of attitude when I was younger, I would be invested if I was interested in the subject, but if I wasn't I would do the bare minimum that would still be passable as ""good enough"".",1647274011.0,12

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren‚Äôt appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don‚Äôt we spend more time with them, why don‚Äôt we go out more, why don‚Äôt we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don‚Äôt do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven‚Äôt done it yet, I probably won‚Äôt ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,3

She comes, and she talked to me, she calm me down and pray together with me.

Im not that religious, although i still remember that moment.
Its not a big thing, she just calm down a kid, and in a way that she know and i know at the time, praying.
She isnt an adult either, i remember her being teen-like, maybe around 14-16 years old.

I dont think that person realize how much she effect my life.
We dont know when or whos life we can effect, and im sure most of the time we have no idea we did just that, over very small things. Like simply smiling to strangers, or go ask your old friend whats up.

They clearly wanted to keep that convention on the SNES controller and add two more buttons so for them I guess it made sense to make the mapping this way, with y and x 'reversed' like b and a are when read left to right. Every Nintendo product since has kept that convention if I'm not mistaken.

Edit: Cool 1000 upvotes :) Im about to hit the hay, so i will leave some more info here.

Inspired by the brave people in Ukraine, and this subreddit r/FarmersStealingTanks Made in a week in Unity with my 2 kids helping, mostly playtesting, as i think i lost them after trying to explain the physics of a spring joint. Was about to add the health system and one of them got real sad that the farmer could die, so now he pops out of his tractor and you can run him home , he is invincible. Drink Nemiroff to double your speed for a bit, and you can destroy other tanks by ramming them with a stolen tank and get a free life. The enemy tanks are terribly incompetent, mainly due to my subpar ai coding, but in the end i left it as it seems to reflect reality ;)

Nowadays there are platforms where you can buy this things for little money. So all you need to do is put this into a game engine and script what do to with it. (Don't be fooled that's a massive understatement) 

But off course there is also a market where you can buy existing code doing dedicated stuff in the game engine of your choice. Like control an object like a car. That expanses the ground functionality of the engine by a lot.

With all this and a good time management making a prototype in a week is very feasible. However everything that goes beyond prototype and mini games needs exponential more time because you can't simply throw in those default solution you purchased somewhere. You will never get an outstanding art style with 3d models you got from random guys on the internet. You quick and dirty code is not working well together with oder qick and dirty code or dedicated code parts that you purchased somewhere if you lack a overlaying concept.

So yes making games is still very time consuming and you will probably need years for everything that's beyond an mini game or prototype.

She's *so. bad.*  And I've read that puppies will test what's acceptable behavior towards their humans once they get more comfortable with them, but I feel like every day is a struggle, and I'm doing my best to conceal my frustration towards her.  I want her to feel only the love I have for her and not my frustration when she's being a total pain in the ass.  But I just feel like she's walking all over us.

All of the advice we receive seems contradictory.  Reinforce positive behavior, distract and redirect bad behavior.  Okay, but how about when 25 little puppy razor teeth are clenched on the palm of my hand and she's tugging on it like it's a game?

How can I show her she lives in ***our***  house?

We've got her in training now, and my wife and I are learning a lot, so time she would be spending destroying our house and attacking us is spent training and practicing, but we're still not sure about getting through this puppy stage.

I'm just venting.  Every day is getting easier.  I just feel like she'll never look at us like the pretty doggo in the OP.",1647284750.0,1

For holidays my parents, me and our dog went to the English seaside.  We fitted our dog in a red lifejacket and we attached a super long flat blue rope to it so he could go swimming in the ocean safely.  Keep in mind this was a Labrador retriever who‚Äôs job back in the day was to retrieve fishing nets from the Labrador Sea, but Asian parents can be a tad overprotective.  

We get to the beach and despite his ¬£60 dog lifejacket and safety rope our supposed water dog wouldn‚Äôt dip one toe in the ocean.  He was practically standing on my mum's feet.  I decided screw it and waded out to start swimming.  I dunk my head in the ocean and start doing the front crawl, after 30 seconds I feel something scratching at me and trying to grab hold of me with it's mouth.  The cowardly yellow custard had only swam out to sea to rescue me.  Worst rescue ever.

My dog was the least demonstrative dog when it came to showing affection, but that memory sustains the belief that he loved us.

5226,aww,I've posted Rusty here before but look at his little hands clasped together as he patiently waits for his daily pretzels,Horcrux922,1647281845.0,62,1932,0.99,"@GoinBlind - Squirrels in the wild should remain that way. They arent meant to keep inside. Only time thats ok is for rehabilitation or rescue of an injured animal. They are meant to be wild. 

I love animals and the best way to show that, is to let wild animals remain wild and enjoy them in their natural habitat. 

FYI: Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other forms of direct contact with infected squirrels. Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid. Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease, Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. - googled information.",1647282736.0,7

If you don't know what you want, you shouldn't be using the drive thru. Different places have different speed of service standards, but generally speaking from the time you trigger the pad until you leave with your food should be 90-180 seconds.

- the sweater pattern is mechanical and all aligned, which wouldn't be the case on a real sweater

- the sweater and shirt both feel composited in, and the shirt is both in and out of focus

- focus drifts and disagrees at different points: for example, her ear (and neck) is out of focus but the hair in front of and behind her ear are both in focus

Very nice job. 
One thing I would consider working on is the background and levels. The thing that has the most artificial impression overall is the background fading into black in the lower left of the picture, because it contrasts with her very colorful cheeck which is receiving light from that area. its much brighter in the original source. I can see the stylistic choice you might have made for a portrait shot, but it might require darkening the cheek just a litte bit. very fine hair on the cheek receiving backlight to add a smooth fade for the silhouette might help sell it even more.",1647260480.0,1

However, I think that it is important to colorize photos, especially in a historical sense. Most people's historical reference point starts with their birth. When they see a b&w photo of say Ruby Bridges as a child being escorted, the technology to produce the original photo gives it an ancient, 'so long ago' reference. When viewing the same photo of Ruby Bridges being escorted, but this time in color, gives the photo the right historical framework as in 'not that long ago'. 

It's weird how our brain perceives color and time together.",1647260948.0,1

1. It looks like there is a curl of her hair in the original that has been removed/confused with background plant life - would be good to add that back in as it looks a bit too clean on that side
2. As a result of this, the 'indent' around the outside corner of her right eye is also absent, giving it a less naturally rounded appearance. As a result it looks like her cheek is basically in line with her brow/forehead rather than curving in at the top.

There is a colorized image of our fire department from the 1920s in my local bank that drives me nuts. Whoever colorized it made the New Jersey flag red instead of yellow. Although, it's also clear that it was done before modern computer tools.

1. Fix any photo damage and over exposed areas.
2. Expand the image for better composition and fill out the areas that need to be. I did that in this case but ended up replacing the entire background anyway coz there was barely anything there.
3. Remove noise as much as possible while trying not to wash out information in order to be able to used later.
4. Spend hours trying to find the closest high quality replacement from stock photos for all the facial features / skin / hair / and other stuff in the photo.
5. Spend more time trying to morph and blend them all to match with the original as much as possible. Improvise when there's no information. Spend a lot of time on this step because the more accurate you can make it, the better the final result will be.
6. Do a base color coating on the entire image.
7. Study the materials in the image and try to overpaint on all of them trying to replicate the material effects -- glossiness, refraction, reflections, specular detail, subsurface scattering for the skin and transparent materials and etc. The more time spent on this, the more realistic the final image will be.
8. Add noise and some intentional photo distortion to make it look like a photo and less like an overpainted image
9. Get lazy after all that work and find hackjobs for less important areas coz it can get tiring.
10. Do a final color grade / lighting fix / overpaint to fix anything that stands out too much.
11. Save and post to reddit.

Here's a WIP GIF of another restoration I did a while ago. This is not the same kind of restoration work as the OP ..but it does kind of outline my process a bit. This one is missing an entire overpaint layer that I now do for skin and etc. [https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4)

But you're right. If I spent more time, I'd have added some more visual detail to the outline of her hair fringe on that side of the face and probably indented her eye socket area a bit more to make it more pronounced on the edges.

A quick rough overpaint . .but I'd have probably built on it this way and done better with the hair. https://i.imgur.com/VUdGpiU.png",1647258267.0,42

Obviously we have more choices and ways of imparting colors, but people regularly wore colorful clothing in the past too, all over the world. And decorated their surroundings in bright colors. Black and white photos are great, because the alternative is almost entirely either nothing, or portraits of the rich. The portraits do show us the colors they had available, but they are biased because they're being paid for, and they create bias in us because the only color we see is worn by the aristocracy.

The change in my world from 0-10 may have been incredible from a scientific view, or an outsider's view...but for me, it goes from being a kid, to still being a kid..  From 10-20, though, enough personal change happens that it could easily be broken into multiple time/emotional groups.  From 20's on out...my views have changed, my circumstances have changed, my lifestyle has changed...but in perspective, I still feel the same person.  So time doesn't feel as impactful.

So things that happened 10 years ago to me, feel very much like they could have only happened last year.  The passing of time just doesn't hit as strongly.  There is little difference from one year to another.  (Taking out huge milestones like the pandemic, 9/11, etc...just considering day to day events)

But as a kid, each year or two years brought about a lot more change.  So time and individual time periods had greater impact.  So that is my perspective on passing time, where I felt it having more of an impact in my life.  During that time, 50 years prior was the 1930's.  Intellectually, I know that is now nearly 100 years ago...but emotionally, it still feels that same 50 yr period as it did when I was coming to terms with life and everything about it.

Time is definitely relative.  And perception becomes one's reality.",1647266035.0,8

We know this isn't true, though. The same factors that caused them to be radicalized by right-wing conspiracist nonsense are the factors that prevent them from recovering from that spiral of radicalization.

The ***overwhelming*** majority of the time, once a person is radicalized, they will remain radicalized for the rest of their life. We don't know a way to reliably de-radicalize people at scale. The only intervention with ***any*** observed success is to engage them in painstakingly patient conversation over a period of months or years, and even then the likelihood of that working is depressingly low. It's a difficult truth to accept, but it simply isn't worth trying to rescue radicalized people. Once they're radicalized, all you can really hope to do is limit the harm they can cause by isolating and marginalizing them so that they are prevented from radicalizing anyone else.

If you want to fight right-wing radicalization, the way to do that is to prevent vulnerable people from becoming radicalized in the first place. That means ***dramatically*** increasing funding for public education, and relentlessly supporting crucial democratic institutions like the free press, voting rights, rule of law, etc.",1647291409.0,1

B) but more importantly, because there is a very obvious right and wrong here. Russia invaded. Ukraine defended. Russia has given no evidence to show why their invasion of a sovereign nation was justified. Ukraine is defending their country, which is justification enough to fight. Russia has committed acts that go far beyond the constraints of war (bombing hospitals, breaking negotiated ceasefires, etc). Ukraine isn't attacking Russia, and is indeed treating Russian prisoners decently by all accounts. If Russia gets to annex Ukraine, it has wide reaching implications for other sovereign areas that Russia would like to reclaim, and eventually for the world. If Ukraine maintains freedom, no one is threatened but Russia, and even then only because they want to take over Ukraine.

So even if we believe that Zelenskyy is actually an awful guy, that doesn't actually justify Russia attacking the country. Especially knowing what we know about how Putin has run Russia. The Russians suffering over this isn't a strike against Zelenskyy... it's another against Putin.

So: would the US respond to Russian aggression against an African nation? 

It depends. 

What does the US have to gain for contesting Russian aggression? Are there strategic importance to the area of contention? And if the US do have something to gain - would the return of investments be worth it?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_submarine_disaster

Quick version

>(The Kursk sank during)... the first major Russian naval exercise in more than 10 years, and all 118 personnel on board were killed. The crews of nearby ships felt the initial explosion and a second, much larger, explosion, but the Russian Navy did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the sub for more than six hours. Because the submarine's emergency rescue buoy had been intentionally disabled during an earlier mission, more than 16 hours were needed to locate the sunken boat.

>(The cause was a) faulty weld on a¬†[65‚Äì76 ""Kit"" practice torpedo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_65_torpedo), leading to an explosion of¬†[high-test peroxide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-test_peroxide)¬†and secondary detonation of 5 to 7 torpedo warheads

>Once officially informed, the British government, along with France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Norway, offered help, and the United States offered the use of one of its two deep submergence rescue vehicles, but the Russian government refused all foreign assistance.

>For President Vladimir Putin, the Kursk crisis was not merely a human tragedy, it was a personal PR catastrophe. Twenty-four hours after the submarine's disappearance, as Russian naval officials made bleak calculations about the chances of the 118 men on board, Putin was filmed enjoying himself, shirtsleeves rolled up, hosting a barbecue at his holiday villa on the Black Sea.

I remember back when the war had just started (as if it was that long ago). People were upvoting Ukrainian resistance news like crazy, especially everything that glorified Zelensky. Then, when he (Zelensky) lashed out at NATO for not putting up a no-fly zone, people refused to upvote those articles until 1-2 days after when eventually all the newspapers talked about it. And when they finally started upvoting it they made one excuse after another like ""don't blame him, he's under a lot of stress"" or ""It's his job to ask for a no-fly zone, and it's NATOs job to say no. It's just standard procedure"" and the likes. Just an endless stream of redditors with self-proclaimed diplomacy and tactical warfare experience.

NATO needs to make it clear to him which actions constitute suicide, and then needs to stick with it no matter what. If he wants to burn the world, there's not much we can do to stop him; NATO's efforts are instead designed around the premise that he won't just decide to end the world.

Given that, the best way to avoid a nuclear escalation is to make the line very, very clear. If Russia uses WMDs in Ukraine, we're at war. If Russia violates NATO territory, we're at war. This avoids any accidental escalation, and it avoids the frog-in-a-boiling-pot problem where we find ourselves staring at nuclear war wondering how things got to that point.

Basically, if Russia knows that a chemical attack on Kyiv means war with NATO, then they won't do it unless they're prepared to burn the world anyway. If they don't know that, they might try it to see if they can get away with it. You risk escalation. But by the same token, it's important that the lines being drawn *aren't* bluffs. We will actually start shooting in Ukraine if Russian troops enter Poland, or gas Kyiv. If they're a bluff, and Putin calls it, then NATO loses the ability to draw a hard line elsewhere - fool me once, etc.

And this is reflected in the actual behavior of the governments in question. Britain is making bellicose statements if Russia enters NATO territory. Poland made downright aggressive statements about what will happen if Russia deploys chemical weapons in Ukraine. These statements are the signals to Putin - here are our lines; if you don't cross them we won't escalate but if you do we will.

If Russia decides they want the world to burn, make no mistake, the world will burn... but for any scenario short of a deliberate murder-suicide on their part, this path is safer.

One further point: It's important to NATO's strategy that they don't apply hard lines *retroactively*. A major goal is to avoid escalation by making decisions crystal clear - if decisions Russia has already made could be cause for disproportionate response, the whole concept of deterrence loses meaning. This is why NATO doesn't intervene in non-NATO countries when nuclear diplomacy is on the line, it's why NATO won't fight in Ukraine without some clear trigger, and it's why Finland needs to get off their asses and join NATO if they want that protection, because if they apply for NATO protection after Russia has already invaded, they're out of luck.",1647286819.0,5

>Russia continues to undermine U.S. relationships and influence using a wide range of capabilities below the threshold of conflict seeking to solidify its great power status.  They actively leverage ambiguous actions through the use of state actors and unattributed individuals and groups in domains with ill-defined boundaries, such as cyber.  These active measures are designed to coerce states on its periphery and expand beyond the near-abroad to interfere with the defenders of international norms, such as the United States and our allies.  To bolster these actions, Russia has pursued modernization of its conventional and strategic nuclear forces.

>Nuclear weapons remain a foundational aspect to Russia‚Äôs strategy, and it has recapitalized over 80 percent of its strategic nuclear forces.  This includes increased warhead delivery capacity.  Modernization efforts of its Strategic Rocket Forces are focused on replacing aging Soviet era road-mobile and silo-based missile systems with modern ICBMs.  Russia, as the leading nation in the world in hypersonic technology, for the moment, continues to heavily invest in and develop hypersonic glide vehicles.  On the 19th of July, Russia successfully tested the ship-launched Zircon hypersonic cruise missile.  They are quite proud of it and publicize it widely.  Dual-use capable weapons systems, like the Zircon, raise the level of ambiguity and complicate deterrence efforts across the continuum of conflict.  Russia proclaims that the modernized land-based hypersonic glide vehicle, the Avangard, is already ‚Äúon-duty‚Äù.

>Hypersonics are in addition to other novel modernization efforts, such as the Poseidon long-range torpedo and the Skyfall cruise missile.  Both are nuclear-powered nuclear-armed weapons which are designed to give Russia asymmetric advantages.  These measures present new challenges for our strategic deterrence.",1647287244.0,4

India and Pakistan each have enough nukes to trigger a small nuclear winter. Yet they have had numerous conflicts, including a small war, in the past 25 years without using nukes. They didn't resort to nukes because at no point in time was the existence of their countries threatened.

The existence of Russia is not threatened by a No Fly Zone over Ukraine. There is no reason they will resort to nuclear weapons.",1647285306.0,4

You cannot enforce a no fly zone without blowing up the other side‚Äôs anti-aircraft weapons and shooting down their planes.

If that nation is a NATO nation, Russia confirming a casus belli against the nation enforcing the no fly zone *probably* (but not automatically) puts massive pressure on the rest of NATO to join in a war against Russia. 

Therefore, the most likely outcome of a no fly zone is war between nuclear-armed nations.

Considering this has never happened before, I am not sure why you're stating it like it's a fact. This is your opinion and mostly conjecture. For all we know, Nato could join the fight in Ukraine and Russia would just back down and leave. It's just as equally likely. 

> How many people including myself saw the amassing of troops as a bluff?

Literally everyone who was paying attention did not see it as a bluff. You do not spend that much time and money putting so much of your infantry and equipment next to a boarder unless you plan to attack. Every expert was saying the attack was going to happen unless someone could talk some sense into Putin, which was unlikely. 

>He invaded Ukrainian for gods sake what makes you think he‚Äôs bluffing about nukes?

Because he first invaded Ukraine in 2014 and the world did basically nothing. Some talks were had, some sanctions put in place by the US, but overall the world turned away and ignored it.... So, he obviously expected the same results. He's spent the last 30 years getting away with whatever he wanted and it's pretty obvious he was not expecting this kind of response from the rest of the world.

Using nukes only has 1 result for Putin. Death. And he knows that.

>If no fly zone is implemented it could trigger a chain of reactions that leads to the worst case scenario

So could arming the people of Ukraine, or implementing sanctions, or seizing Russian assets. It's all calculated risks and a delicate balancing act. But, the fact that the world has managed to basically harm Russia financially to the point of pushing them back towards the brink of collapse, and there's still no escalation outside of Ukraine, is a pretty big indicator that jumping to Nuclear isn't something Russia is anxious to do.

Salt is definitely still available as I bought a pack just a few days ago.

Buckwheat  and flour - haven't checked but there has been nothing of it being out of stock on the news. I guess ill check it out next time I'm at a grocery store, but I suspect that there are no supply issues.

Some members of the Russian speaking minority definitely have been brainwashed by the Russian state media, but a great deal of the Russian speaking populace (especially younger and more educated lot) is very much pro Estonian and anti Putin.

The only things I remember are Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf and his repeated stuttering because he was a hyperactive character, and Megan Fox leaning over a car engine. 

I have a lot of animator friends who worked on the films and they loved it because the cg character rigs for the Transformers had so many moving bits that they were fun to animate, but then on screen most of the action is just a blur of motion.  And none of the designs were very memorable to be honest.  They all looked like junkyard trash monsters.

The Michael Bay movies never had faith that the Transformer characters & lore could carry a movie on their own. Humans play such a minor role in the cartoons, with Spike & Daniel as pretty much the only ones we see on a regular basis. The movies center around the humans with a robot battle thrown in once in a while. The designs were terrible. After half a dozen movies, I couldn't tell you what any of the characters look like aside from Optimus & Bumblebee. The characters have no faces, and their silhouettes are just random jumbles of noise rather than discernable figures.

The death of Optimus Prime and a LOT of the G1 crew was a legitimate trauma for those of us who were kids when we watched it. I hadn't seen anything like that - a show where they'd permanently\* killed a lot of the most important characters in an ongoing series. And at the BEGINNING of the movie, to boot. 

But it's also a story about the difficulty inheriting the mantle of leadership and not being ready for it. Ultra Magnus was a ""good man"", but couldn't fill Prime's shoes. That's a complicated message for a ""kid's movie"". There were a broad spectrum of characters, but you always understood their motivations. Starscream valued power over loyalty - but like Ultra Magnus, he couldn't hold that power when he had it.

Unicron was a legitimate threat - not just to the Autobots and Decepticons, but to \*everything\*. In the Bayformers movies, nothing ever really feels grounded in anything I care about. The characters are so bleh that they're not distinct or interesting, they're not motivated by things I believe or care about, and even when characters died in those movies, I didn't have any emotional attachment to them beyond their ties to \*other versions\* of those characters I \*did\* care about.",1647289313.0,2

Some of the animation is attrocious. Like, really, really terrible. Compare it to something like Akira which came out at a similar time (hardly a fair comparison, I know) can you can tell it was done for at little as possible.

Find me a remake of an animated movie in live-action, and I'll show you a crappy movie.

Why is that? Because an animated feature-length film is a special effect that lasts for 90+ minutes. That means that the filmmakers need to work much, much harder to plan out their film in the concept stages. By contrast, in a live-action work, only the effects are planned out meticulously, and the dialogue is quite literally just *filler*, meant to pad out the runtime of the movie, as well as provide the necessary exposition dump required to make the movie make sense.

There are exceptions, of course. George Miller's magnificent ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was thoroughly storyboarded before they ever went to shoot a single inch of filmstock.

I think this is one of the more understated problems of the Bay films is that there's kind of no design language to the Transformers' look in that iteration. Like they sometimes don't have a coherent style within themselves (Scorponok in the Bay films)

The original toys and by extension the original animated iteration knew that part of the joy of the transformer is getting a hint of what it could turn into, parts of the vehicle shows up on their robot forms. There's also a sharp idea of color theory and what models Hasbro got from Takara to establish who is ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"".

Decepticons are not only typically warmachines they're usually angular and their colors are cooler, mint, neon. By contrast autobots are squarish and come in warmer & solid colors. You don't really need to know jack potatoes about the Transformers to see in the animated ones of who's good and who's bad because it's aware it's for kids.

They're both ""dumb commercials"" but the difference is animated one has fully embraced the idea of ""this is how children play with their toys"". Whereas the Bay films trying to rationalize the Transformers which is kind of stupid on top of an idea that fully admits it's kinda dumb.

He was exploring because he was bored.  ET did it.  It's pretty much a genre trope to happen with this kind of story, character who is meant to be hiding, get's bored, sneaks out to explore and then makes a mess in a ""comedic"" way.  It happens in the aforementioned ET, Short Circuit, any movie with a stray dog that's been taken in, Transformers (the first Bay film), Harry and the Hendersons, etc.

>What was all the silly shit about the female lead being some sort of traumatized diver?

Did... did you not watch the movie?  Her father was connected to her love of diving, and he died and she's been depressed and refuses to dive anymore out of depression.  It was pretty on the nose. It was character development that came full circle when she needed to dive into the water at the end.

>What was everything to do with John Cena?

Again I feel like you haven't actually seen the movie.  Cena was part of the military, when Bumblee crashes into Earth and fights with Blitzwing, and Blitzwing kills most of Cena's soldiers, and now you have Cena with a burning case of revenge on his mind against sentient machine aliens.

It looks super good, I will definitely watch this. However, as a kid (35) who has played all the Sega Genesis Sonic games, I feel like this movie is out of sequence. Chronologically, I thought they would go for Sonic 2, but instead they are basically going Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Things that would indicate this are; At the end of Sonic the Hedgehog movie, Robotnik is seen in a thicket of tall mushrooms, which would indicate that his is in Mushroom Hill Zone (Sonic & Knuckles),  Sonic snowboarding downhill avoiding an avalanche, indicates Ice Cap Zone (Sonic 3).  The temple with the Master Emerald, is from Hidden Palace Zone (Sonic & Knuckles). I could go more in depth but those are just some of the obvious ones (to me).

The rules for any kind of safety are chosen to result in an ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù level of risk. For food safety, ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù is nearly no one would get sick if the rules are followed. 

It‚Äôs possible that someone with a compromised immune system could get sick from an amount of bacteria or mold that a healthy person could handle no problem. It‚Äôs possible that your food was exposed to a very unusual bacteria or mold that can survive colder/hotter temperatures than most pathogens, and so the standard rules missed a rare exception. It‚Äôs also possible that you have a great immune system, and maybe you could eat more salmonella than most people without getting sick.

Keep in mind that some pathogens make toxins that won‚Äôt break down from cooking, even though the pathogen itself dies when the food is reheated.

If properly cooked food stays in the ‚Äúdanger zone‚Äù for less than two hours, you probably won‚Äôt get sick by eating it. Nothing magic happens at the two hour mark, that‚Äôs just the number that the USDA recommends for what they‚Äôve decided is an acceptable level of risk. 

I know people who will eat leftovers that sat out at room temp for several hours. They haven‚Äôt got sick yet to my knowledge. Maybe they will someday. Some foods go bad faster than others, some places are cleaner than others, food that‚Äôs covered and left alone probably won‚Äôt get as much bacteria/mold on it as food that‚Äôs sitting in the open or touched a lot.

Basically, our brains are hardwired for certain traits, including altruism, empathy, etc. For the most part, it's adaptive to have these traits because individuals with empathy will be welcomed as co-dependent members of the tribe who engage properly within social systems, for example, trading, caring for one another, not clubbing your neighbour for his food, not stealing, not raping, and so on. However, any human population is going to have some degree to which it can tolerate ""cheaters"" - those who do not exhibit pro-social traits but can successfully freeload and survive to pass on their genes by stealing, killing, raping. When you look at a heterogeneous gene pool within a tribe, it makes sense that the evolutionarily optimal distribution of members within this group may not be 100% empaths and 0% psychopaths. If everyone was a ""cheater"" then altriusm would dissolve and the tribe would fail, so the majority intuitively ostracize cheaters, but if cheaters can exist in some number on the skirts of a population then, just like actual parasites, there is an evolutionary niche for them to fulfill in the population. 

Similar theory can be applied to many other ""disorders"". It's useful for the tribe to have some members who have a heightened sense of anxiety - they might enjoy life less and live slightly less long, but they'll sound the alarm earlier in the night when a neighbouring tribe comes to bash skulls. Even though it's not nice for the anxious person, it's nice for the tribe to have those anxious people around. Part of the human experience is that we may each have traits that were adaptive for primitive tribal living, but now feel maladaptive in our safe, artificial society.",1647234781.0,39

For example there was a surgeon and a cancer nurse. Both considered that they had a certain disconnect from people but were able to fake an interest in patients to set them at ease. The lack of an emotional connection meant dealing with patient death became much easier. The nurse in particular mentioned that she felt it made her a better worker in comparison to her colleagues.

The thing is that neither were criminal and could be considered as fully functional human beings. They couldn't even be compared to the legendary psychopathic CEO screening at employees. They just weren't that bothered by people but were helping them as a matter of professional pride.

This is a matter of definition *and* the inevitable result of evolutionary processes being viewed subjectively through human sociocultural value systems.

There are many natural things which are abhorrent or tragic yet functioning as ""intended"". Some survival strategies become evil when utilized by homo sapiens - That stigma prevents investigation and understanding.

I've been suggesting for years that psychopathy is a real-deal survival strategy (A ""Hail Hary"", epigenetic or psychological) which exists specifically to maximize reproductive fitness by throwing away social exchange ""checks and balances"" in favor of maximizing personal gain Prisoner's Dilemma style. This can be spontaneous or in response to the environment.

Is it a shitty deal for everyone else still ""on rails"" with the trusty, rusty socialization impulses that made our species so successful? Oh yes! And we respond with primal intensity when we detect subversion of that system. Hell, it comes with a whole minefield of faux pas and validation checkpoints that help ensure the consistency of social interaction/exchange. What's a blush response except a signal? ""Faux pas noted! See?"" It's genuinely a system.

So yes, there's all sorts of disorder-adaptations out there. Forming new and more accurate distinctions would aid with patient care, management, therapy - Word choice/association *alone* can often change perspectives and outlooks.

One of the disorders I'd like reconfigured in this manner is psychosis - I believe we now exist in an era where ""in opposition to consensus reality"" is insufficient to describe the desync. Populations can easily compartmentalize deeply into echo chambers and disinfo hives where cognitiohazards bloom *directly* into legitimacy - ""You get it too, right? Me too!""

Only about 1/3rd of individuals meeting the criteria for ASPD also meet the criteria for psychopathy. But nearly every individual that meets the criteria for psychopathy meets the criteria for ASPD.

The difference is that psychopathy tends to include traits from the other Cluster B personality disorders as well, borrowing traits from narcissistic (the lack of empathy and grandiosity),  borderline (with impulsivity) and histrionic (exaggerated emotional expression).

But among psychiatrists? It isn't that useful a construct, as it would generally be better to define someone as having ASPD with narcissistic traits, or some such, given the stigma associated with labeling someone a psychopath and the lack of actual diagnostic utility in doing so.

To put it another way: Psychiatrists don't actually use ""psychopathy"" as a diagnosis anymore, and have not for decades.

Only tangentially related, but there is a character in a game I was playing a while ago that I was pleasantly surprised by.

In Shadowrun Hong Kong you can find a party member named Richter. He is basically an engineer that builds drones with a direct mental interface. After you do enough work with him and become friends he admits that he is diagnosed as a psychopath.

I expected the game to immediately have him turn darker and more sinister and less trust worthy and all the other things they usually do,but the character actually develops a great deal of depth. First off you are safe from his darker tendencies because he likes you. Also he has nothing to gain from hurting you, and rather enjoys the conversation you have.

He brings up that he does not enjoy hurting other people and doesn't do it for fun. He just also doesn't care if he has to hurt someone. He will try other methods first because they are more efficient, and because he considers himself pro-social. He just also isn't going to feel bad about blasting someone that refused to stand down when he offered them another way out.

It was interesting to see them write a character that is undeniably a psychopath by his behavior, with a general disregard for their own safety and the safety of others, narcissistic grandeur, and tendency toward casual violence, but that is not all their is to him.

Everything you said makes perfect sense and I agree, except this part. You, as well as the authors of the article, seem to have completely misunderstood what the term ""disorder"" means in psychology.

I feel like there is some desire of people to separate disorders from the ""natural order"" of things thst supposedly exists. To identify them as something  ""unnatural"", but that's not what they are and that is pretty much universally agreed, which is why the nomenclature used in the article is misguided. There's no reason why it would matter for a disorder if it stems from a genetic defect, learnt behaviour or an evolutionary useful trait. (Except for helping when devising treatment of course.)

Disorder is clearly and exclusively a construct of society and morals. What is and isn't a disorder depens on the norms and values of society, not on the reason for its occurrence. A disorder is (broadly speaking) a trait that leads to non-normative thinking or behaviour that is impairing, distressing or otherwise harmful to the individual exhibiting the trait or others around them.

This makes the idea of mental disorders innately cultural. Case in point: We used to think of homosexuality as a ""disorder"" (it was included in the DSM until 1987), because it lead to behaviour that society at large thought of as harmful and suppressing that behaviour based on that disapproval lead to distress for the person exhibiting the desire to do so.

We luckily changed that, but that is not due to better understanding of homosexuality, but due to a shift of cultural norms. The old classification wasn't ""wrong"" in the sense that it is unscientific, it was wrong in the sense that we now agree that it put the burden to adapt their behaviour on the wrong person, that being homosexual doesn't actually harm anyone and the people feeling offended by others sexuality are the problem. 


tl;dr: If you want to argue about psychopathic behaviour not being considered a disorder, you don't need to argue about why or how it occurs, you need to argue that as a society, we should embrace and accept psychopathic behaviour as something that doesn't harm the people exhibiting it or others.",1647244150.0,56

Yes that's a good line of thought, however it will depend a lot on how that society is structured.

Psychopaths often rise to the top because they ruthlessly seek power. So the ability of a society to regulate the destructive influence of psychopaths is related to how much basic democratic power there is, or if it's an oligarchy where commoners have no practical power over elites.

I think this plays a role in explaining why small states often create better living conditions than big ones. Their elected representatives have more direct social connections to their voters, who can therefore sort out psychopaths more effectively.

The answer was to tell everyone that all-mighty, invisible entities were watching you at all times, and if you did something ""wrong"" (as determined, conveniently enough, by the rulers) those entities would punish you for eternity.

Assuming this to be at least somewhat plausible, then religion would have provided a means to keep even the psychopathic among a population at least nominally under control, as everyone around them would demand that everyone else obey lest they all incur the wrath of <INSERT GOD OF YOUR CHOICE HERE>.

First, this study uses meta-analysis, which can be controversial depending on the inclusion criteria of the selected studies. However, we could make the weak conclusion that psychopathy is not associated with handedness. To make the weak conclusion that psychothapy is not a mental disorder, one would have to assume that all mental disorders are associated with handedness. Just because some mental disorders are associated with handedness or prenatal stress doesn't mean that all mental disorders must be associated with handedness, or the worse reverse association, which philosophers and religious figures used to wholeheartedly embrace. Maybe psychopathy is not strongly associated with prenatal development. 

For example, [an small but actual study (not a meta-analysis) published in nature found that 30-90% of psychopathy is associated with the expression of a number of different genes.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0488-z) Prenatal development might affect the methylation of these genes, but would presumably not have a causal effect on their expression or lack thereof. If genes are associated with what most people believe is a mental disorder, then I think it is pretty hard to say that genes help determine psychopathy but imply that psychopathy is purely an environment dependent strategy, rather than a disorder.  

In conclusion, psychopathy is not associated with handedness, but is associated with certain genes. I don't think that should disqualify the characterization of psychopathy as a dangerous and disruptive mental disorder.",1647238721.0,31

Merriam-Webster defines ""begging the question"" as ""to pass over or ignore a question by assuming it to be established or settled."" In other words, it means that you're stating as fact what you are trying to prove. For example, Brian Klems is funny because he writes humorously. The conclusion is that Brian is funny. The premise assumes that he writes humorously. There's no evidence in the statement that supports the claim that he's funny. Therefore, the sentence should read: Brian Klems is funny because he writes humorously, but that argument begs the question of whether he writes humorously or not.",1647261191.0,5

This is why the term ""neurodiversity"" has become so widespread in the community.

As far as labeling it a disability, though, I still do. Disabled to the community is not about the trait being inherently bad, it's about society's reaction to and willingness to accommodate the trait. While ADHD is a plus to me, it's also a lot harder to function in a society that prioritizes a 9-5 schedule, mandates specific tasks be done in specific ways or orders, and that says fidgeting or hyperkinetic energy is ""unprofessional"" for example. Thus, with ADHD, *I am disabled by my environment, not my body.* Similarly, multiple close friends are deaf and/or blind, and all say the same thing. The issue isn't their body, it's the environment and accessibility.

lead is a very practical metal with tons of usecases, and it's apparently very common in jewellery, likely for its malleability and weight. It's also often used in solders for its lower melting point, making it significantly easier to work with.

[This old paper I quickly found says](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/JBCPP.2006.17.4.213/html) that jewelers have a good 3-4x the amount of lead in the blood than those who're not occupationally lead-exposed.

You've got me wondering how this manifests in actuality. Meaning, throw in some random noise to cause a slightly different outcome, ie, instead of a choice between 2 states, it would be on a scale of 1 to 100 (or to 1000) where at some point the 50% threshold is crossed and the value flips.

I'm guessing if it got stuck in a loop of vengefulness there would need to be another variable, such that receiving forgiveness increments a value and vengefulness decrements the value. And below a certain threshold (""bank account"" value) a bias is added to attempt option 3 with a cumulatively greater probability.

It's like radar that's always on and kind of like that enhance thing we make fun of in TV series. I can ""zoom"" in on conversations all around the business office, sometimes half a room away. It's a real struggle not to hear conversations or to ignore scenarios of discussion I have the answer to. I can make a problem go away real quick by interjecting but it's considered rude to interrupt the conversation. Instead, I sit there and listen to people arguing about a non-issue and wishing they would stop arguing so I can focus on work. I can hear telephone calls three cubicles over, even when the person physically present is speaking in a normal voice. I can't block out the sound of the electronic hum of devices in the background, the best I can do is make it ""white noise"" that I zoom in on as needed.

The person who gives me an MRI for the autistic women over 40 research I've consented to be part of says that autistic brains can't ""still"" even when attempting medication. They are looking at drugs that make the brain slow down and I declined that. I don't want my brain to slow down, there are parts of my brain like pattern recognition and noticing differences that make me very valuable at work - I make a decent living that allows me to support my kids. I don't want to shut the thing off that makes people headhunt me for jobs.

But it's a struggle sometimes, when it's finally quiet, I'm lonely and separate from people. But I want to be around the people I love. They are just so excruciatingly noisy though and it's hard to tamp down the irritation at the overwhelming noise.",1647269855.0,22

It was bizarre, but I think my brain just *has to* be solving a problem and if there isn't a problem, it just creates them out of nothing.

ABA aims to stop autistic people from doing ""weird"" things without any consideration of *why* the autistic person is doing the weird thing.

For example, let's say an autistic kid keeps taking their clothes off in public. This is a pretty serious problem, because most society has a pretty strong rule against being naked in public. How do you resolve this mismatch? A classical ABA practitioner would simply punish the kid every time they take their clothes off. They'll try to justify it by saying ""it's for their own good"", but a lot of parents don't buy that, and take their kids out of ABA. Maybe the specific parent of the kid from our example does. Then, they have to find an alternate way to solve the problem, because public nudity is still a big taboo. The parent finds a recommendation for a different ABA place, one that promises to be ""punishment-free"". This looks better to the allistic mind, because punishment is the problem, right? If the kid simply gets rewarded every time they *do* keep their clothes on, isn't that better than them being punished? Well, no, because there's a deeper issue here. Our example parent doesn't have a lot of experience with autism, so they've never asked *why* their kid keeps disrobing in the grocery store and at school. It turns out that for many autistic people, sensory input is interpreted very differently. Something as normal as wearing clothes can be downright painful for some autistic people. So training the kid to keep their clothes on is basically training them in pain endurance. That's the real problem with ABA- they're treating the symptoms, not the cause. No amount of ABA will ever decrease the amount of discomfort the kid is feeling in their everyday life just from wearing clothes. So what would a better solution be? Maybe you try to find clothing that they're more comfortable in. Even if they end up being under-dressed most of the time, that's better than going around naked. So go shopping with them and help them pick out clothes that they'd rather wear. Maybe you compromise on *when* they have to wear clothes, so they can, say, just wear underwear at home, decreasing the total amount of discomfort over the day and thus making it easier for them to cope. Maybe you do just offer praise or a reward for staying dressed, if nothing else works, because pain can be easier to go through when you know it's being acknowledged. But the main point is to meet the autistic person halfway, and accommodate for their struggles in some way. ABA doesn't do that, and that's the main problem with it.",1647282832.0,2

On that note, what we've been calling the ""new normal"" is in fact a collapse. Old institutions and norms are insisting that they'll survive this period of chaos and complaining of a slight cough when what they have is cancer.

Exposure to even moderate ambient lighting during nighttime sleep, compared to sleeping in a dimly lit room, harms your cardiovascular function during sleep and increases your insulin resistance the following morning, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.

‚ÄúThe results from this study demonstrate that just a single night of exposure to moderate room lighting during sleep can impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation, which are risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome,‚Äù said senior study author Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for people to avoid or minimize the amount of light exposure during sleep.‚Äù

There is already evidence that light exposure during daytime increases heart rate via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which kicks your heart into high gear and heightens alertness to meet the challenges of the day. 

‚ÄúOur results indicate that a similar effect is also present when exposure to light occurs during nighttime sleep,‚Äù Zee said.

We handed your question to the researcher behind this study,  Postdoc Angela Pinot De Moira, and she replied:

""This is of course an important consideration when interpreting the results of our study. However, we did try to explore this possibility by examining whether the effect of having a cat or dog in early-life differed in children who had a parent with a history of asthma compared with children whose parents did not have a history of asthma. We also explored whether the effect differed in children who experienced wheeze in the first 3 years of life compared with those who did not. In both case there was no evidence for a different effect.   
  
We did, however, also examine the effect of timing of ownership and the risk of asthma. Here, effect estimates were very small (suggesting timing had little influence on the risk of asthma), but there was a tendency for ownership prenatally only to be associated with greater odds of school-age asthma, and ownership in early childhood only or continuous ownership to be associated with lower odds of school-age asthma compared with no ownership. This could suggest that sustained exposure is required to maintain any protection conferred by early-life dog or cat ownership, as has been suggested from farm studies. It could, however, also be consistent with reverse causation, that is, the removal of cats or dogs from the homes of children with early manifestations of allergy or asthma.""

Very low sample size, but this is what happened to my older son. We do not own pets (except a frog at the time), and my older son was at a home daycare with multiple dogs as an infant, with no reactions then. Around a year of age, we changed to an institutional daycare, and he had zero contact with dogs or other animals. He developed a peanut allergy as well as severe dog allergy. The peanut allergy is being managed through exposure therapy through an allergy clinic, but the dog allergy persisted.

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279012.0,27

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times.

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead. That knowledge, that I would take someone else's life, even in self defense, has permanently fucked up my mind. I thought I was a pacifist. I never knew how I would feel or what decisions I would make until I was in that situation. But now I know and I can't unknow it anymore.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die.

An attacker within arms reach is still a threat.

Now, if they turn and run, or throw their hands up and back off, cool. Confrontation over.

If they keep fighting with you, then... you may have to do what it takes to make them unable to harm you.

Reagan was BY FAR one of the WORST Presidents in American history.  I truly can't stand the demented bastard.  I can't even count the number of times I've mentioned Reagan's destruction of the 2A to a right-wing nutjob during an argument and EVERY SINGLE TIME I do, they just stop responding because they have no comeback.  It's truly pathetic.

How ironic that the Republican President who is almost universally regarded as ""the best President in American history"" (or WAS prior to Diaper Donnie and the Trump Derangement Syndrome that has overtaken 99.9% of Republicans today) by Republicans is the President who did BY FAR the most damage to the 2A out of any President in the last 40+ years.

Reagan used his assassination attempt and the crippling of James Brady as an excuse to ban a MYRIAD of firearms...none of which were even remotely similar to the little .22 caliber REVOLVER that he and Brady were actually shot with.  Funny how that works, isn't it?  ""Gun control"" legislation always seems to target the firearms that the gun-grabbers consider ""scary"" or ""dangerous"" and NEVER the ones that actually account for a majority of the ""gun deaths"" in this country.  Brady's namesake gun-grabbing group has spent over three decades trying to ban EVERYTHING BUT the type of firearm that actually left him wheelchair-bound.

Reagan's passage of FOPA essentially banned the sale of full auto firearms to law-abiding Americans.  And I am absolutely certain that turning a specific subset of firearms into something that ONLY the rich and powerful can actually afford to purchase is quite literally THE EXACT THING that the Founding Fathers intended to prevent by including the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights.  And the reason why Reagan's signing of FOPA into law is by far the worst gun control legislation EVER is because I am absolutely certain that it is one of the anti-gun laws that we will NEVER be able to get repealed.

While pretty much everyone knows about Reagan's signing of FOPA into law, very few people seem to realize that it is specifically because of him that the 1994 ""Assault Weapons Ban"" was passed.  Clinton may have pushed for the law and signed it when it reached his desk (and Joe Biden may proudly take 100% credit for it), but it never would've made it past the Senate if not for the actions of one Ronald Reagan.  

Reagan PERSONALLY called up multiple Republican Senators and told them that voting for the ban was ""the right thing to do"".  Clinton didn't have the votes to pass it...it was Ronald Reagan's personal pleas to multiple Republican Senators that got the bill passed by...I believe...ONE single vote.  Just imagine how much damage Reagan would've done to the 2A if the 1994 AWB didn't have the 10 year sunset included?  It's terrifying to even think about.

So it's safe to say that I have a deep hatred of Reagan.  He did a ton of damage to the USA in multiple ways, but it's his destruction of the Second Amendment that makes me truly DESPISE him.  I was born just after Reagan's second term ended so I never had the opportunity to buy a brand new MP5 for $1,500 or whatever they cost new back in 1985.  Never had the chance to buy a full auto M16 for $1,000.  Never had the chance to buy a MAC-10 for $200.  

I've been contemplating getting into full auto firearms for years now but it's hard to justify it when the most entry-level .223 rifle you can buy is a $12,500 Ruger AC556 and an uncontrollable-but-probably-really-fun MAC-10 is $8,500.",1647293053.0,1

Reagan signed the repeal, which was placed on his desk by Congress, but he was merely following the wishes of the elected representatives of his constituents.

Reagan agreed with the majority of the Democrats that it was better to allow the states to retain control of funding and operations in mental health institutions.

What Reagan did do, as governor of California, was to sign the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act in 1972.

* The portuguese royal family supposedly didn't have to flee the country, the french battalion that Napoleon sent to Portugal was weak and tired and couldn't have won the battles even if they wanted.
* The main reason Brazil is under developed to this day is because the country started being a nation (in a european sense) after 1808. After 1808, the country started having formal education, universities, books (were forbidden until then), currency, banks, justice system and a Constitution. Contrary to the US, in 1800, only 1% of the brazilian population was able to read.
* The brits were responsible for the voyage, and they noted many interesting things, like the very precarious situation in the portuguese ships, like the rotting wood of the ships, spoiled water, etc.
* In 1808, Rio didn't have currency (they exchanged goods) and the official language was Tupi Guarani (native tribe). Which means, Rio spent 300 years being developed in a semi european semi tribal way.",1647271724.0,12

A m√©trica d'Os Lus√≠adas exige uma leitura sil√°bica - o que, em lingu√≠stica chama-se de pron√∫ncia ""syllable-timed"", onde todas as s√≠labas possuem a mesma dura√ß√£o temporal. O portugu√™s brasileiro possui essa caracter√≠stica. J√° no caso do portugu√™s europeu, a pron√∫ncia √© ""stress-timed"", e as s√≠labas t√¥nicas possuem dura√ß√£o temporal muito maior que as outras s√≠labas. Da√≠ a pron√∫ncia cols-TROL europeia, enquanto a brasileira √© CO-LES-TE-R√ìU (como dizes).

Se declamares a primeira estrofe de Os Lus√≠adas, ver√°s que o ritmo brasileiro encaixa-se melhor na m√©trica decass√≠laba camoniana, enquanto se acaso uses a m√©trica europeia, ver√°s que o ritmo fica comprometido. E √© compreens√≠vel, porque o portugu√™s europeu adquiriu essa forma nos s√©culos XVIII e XIX, enquanto o brasileiro conservou uma forma mais arcaica de pron√∫ncia, mais pr√≥xima da de Cam√µes.
Portugu√™s brasileiro:

And they were anointed kings.

That's precisely *why* there would be implications.

Prior precedent was that the English *and* highest regnal number were the same. It was a bit of an issue with Elizabeth II, but most people accepted the 'highest regnal number' justification. Going with David would mean the highest regnal number was the Scottish one, and someone's nose would be put out of joint.

If he becomes David I,  it becomes explicit that it's the *English* line which is followed. This will anger people in Scotland. If he becomes David III, it becomes explicit that the English line is being downgraded. This will anger people in England.

Choosing names that are either entirely new post-Act of Union (Victoria, George) or which have higher English numbers (Edward, Elizabeth) mostly avoids this. Everyone in England is kept happy, and there's a reasonable justification for people in Scotland which minimises the dissatisfaction.

Of Prince William's names, probably the least controversial would be Louis. William would play badly in Northern Ireland and areas with a large Irish population. Arthur is just pretentious. Philip raises the question of whether to count Philip II of Spain, who was crowned King when he married Mary I of England.

>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

Still, it would be really weird to see someone else's face on there! Her coins will still be around for a loooong time after she's gone though, I still find ones from the early 80s in my change. Stamps and paper currency will be changed right away though, when that happens there's usually a window of time for the old ones to be collected before they're no longer legal tender.

Changing paper notes can't be *that* hard though, about 20 years ago there was a massive bank robbery here in Belfast where they made off with millions (funny enough I walked past right as it was happening and wondered why there were vans there!). They got away with so much money, the local bank decided it would just be easier to reprint all the notes in new colours instead of looking for the millions in stolen ones, and render them worthless to the robbers. The old colours were made worthless paper. We all had a few months to exchange our notes before they were withdrawn, and serial numbers were checked at the same time. I imagine the heisters were pretty pissed, they probably had a nice bonfire with their haul! :D
