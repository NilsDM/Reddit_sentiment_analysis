I high school I took drivers ed and one of the vehicles we had to drive was a Rambler with a 3 on the column. Everyone in the classes had to drive that old car. After that a 4 or more on the floor was easy.

Then there was the old, and I mean really old small truck we had at my summer job. I worked at a lodge in a national park in a neighboring state one summer. There was this old truck that was a floor shift which was really the easy part. The hard part was that there was a choke that had to be set just right or you would flood the engine or it would refuse to start. Seems that old truck liked me as I was one of the early arriving staff and drove it to get supplies to all the cabins as we cleaned and opened them for the season. One day I was waiting tables for breakfast and got called outside to the truck. All the guys from the garage were there along with all the housekeeping staff who were trying to get to their assigned cabins. No one could start the truck. I got in, set the choke, and started that old truck right up. Seems they had flooded the engine but, while they waited for someone to get me from the dining room enough fuel had drained and setting the choke properly made it just turn over right away. I did not let any of the guys from the garage forget that a 19 year old girl could start an old truck that they could not.",1647296549.0,93

It has a choke, spring brake chambers on an air brake system that won’t release until it builds pressure and hit a button under the dash.  It has reverse where most manuals have first. The 5 speed transmission has almost no synchros and the shift linkage is stupidly complex which makes it very vague. It has a two speed rear axle just to confuse things further. 

If they did manage to get it rolling it maxes out at 55mph absolutely wide open at the engine’s redline.  You could almost keep up with it on a moped. granted it can still do 55mph while hauling 14,000 pounds.

OK... it wasn't stolen. And it technically wasn't my first stick ever... I grew up on a farm where having access to stick was a norm so I'd been introduced to the concepts in a growing form (note that tractors and the sort have very different transmissions so don't match 1:1 with a car's tranny).

But the day that I learned to drive an actual stick, all on my own with no assistance, was when I was around 12. My dad was a truck driver who hauled cars. And I'd ride with him all the time to ""spend time"", or to just travel. Like if I was going to visit him in Florida for the summer, I'd ride in the truck rather than fly.

Well he was moving a porsche down for a friend of a friend on heavy discount as a favor. And the guy was being a total dick bag about it and was going to stiff my pops on the money because he thought he could get away with it due to the relationship that tied the 2 together (lets just say my dad was in some unsavory side business back when he was alive).

So my dad was going to have to eat the loss on this one.

Well, while sitting in the palm beach auto auction where he was unloading the rest of his load. He tossed me the keys to the porsche and said:

""I think it's about time you learn to drive stick.""

For 2 hours I drove around that auto auction lighting that clutch on fire!

In my experience it's usually the people who hill hold and the people who constantly rest their foot against the clutch when they're not shifting. Hill holding is absolutely awful for your clutch and is a bandaid for people's inability to do hill starts without rolling back, and the foot resting there often turns into slightly riding the clutch 100% of the time without noticing. Lot of people also constantly rest their hand on the shifter (I call it Vin Dieseling) which tends to cause unnecessary synchro wear. 

Granted I'm a big dickwaving manual transmission elitist who learned in a manual from day one of driving, but as far as I'm concerned the clutch on a street car making stock power and doing standard commuter duty is functionally a lifetime part.

That's not the only reason valets are used.   

Some times the parking lot is small and you can't fit all the cars into the spaces (i.e. cars need to be blocked in).   In those cases a valet has access to all the cars keys, and can move cars as needed to get them in and out.

Other times valets have specific lots they have access to as well for parking cars.

Sometimes it's simply convenience rather than laziness.   You're at a hotel, you're checking in, you have bags.

He spent years following Jesus' teachings, which as we know, were not easy to follow. He had to sell his possessions and follow Jesus around, being selfless, caring and just an overall good person. He probably lived his life as a better person than most people who ever lived.

Then the man was predestinated to betray Jesus. His betrayal was literally prophesied. If he didn't do it, Jesus would have given a false prophecy, which couldn't happen. Also if he didn't betray Jesus, God's whole plan to sacrifice Jesus for the sins of the world wouldn't have happened.

(These pictures are still inaccurate as they are super racist, by picturing Judas as being of darker skin and hair. )

""to betray with a kiss"" is a saying for this reason. 

FYI - the anti homosexuality rhetoric comes  from Leviticus in the old testament and some of Paul's letters in the new testament.  

Leviticus is full of purification laws that that 99% of Christians do not follow anyway and the bit about homosexuality being a sin may have been a mistranslated and is actually forbidding pedophilia,  which was very common between bosses and apprentices  in Greece at the time. 

Paul also makes it clear every time that he talks about homosexuality, that he lumps it in with other sexual sins, eg sex before marriage, cheating on your spouse etc.  and that he thinks it's something that a person can change about themselves.  He claims to have known people who were  no longer like that.  ( Which could have easily been bi people who now had heterosexual relationships or gay people who became celibate.)

The current focus on anti-homosexuality as the ""worst sin"",  especially to the extent that someone might disown their child,  is modern and completely against the teachings of Jesus.

(2) Unless it was for a portrait, even Renaissance paintings often used stock faces and postures, so repetition was common.  There is a ""Crippled beggar"" that basically is copypasta-ed across the Renaissance oeuvre.

(3) People often had much more restrictive ideas of personal space than we do.  People being close together was not the indicator of romantic intimacy we treat it as.  Often, other signs were used to indicate romantic intimacy

(4) Public demonstrations of closeness were often used to make a point to the viewers, not to get a sexual smooch.  Kissing or hugging someone was a way to say  ""This person and I are closer than they are with you, so I have more worth"", not to say ""We shag all the time""

(5) Implying Christ was homosexual was straight up heresy - and they tied people to posts and lit them on fire for less.  Even implying Christ like a good pegging was a one-way trip to a BBQ where you were the pig.  And all of the Renaissance painters were massively Catholic living in Catholic nations.  They were not going to risk serious punishments even if they did think Jesus and Judas got it on.

(6) This isn't to say there were no homosexual men in either Antiquity or the Renaissance, but using modern homosexual signifiers doesn't translate as seamlessly as you are implying.

There's a bunch of other stuff too. Halos were stolen from Egyptians I think.

But that's all later retconning to make the religion more palatable to other cultures as they were taken over. Totally unrelated to whether there was an original ""truth"" before the religious leaders got their corrupt little hands on it.

Actually, in Joseph Smith's time, black people could receive the priesthood, and even after the restrictions, could still be baptized and be a full member of the Church. As to WHY those restrictions were even put in place at all... I don't know. And nobody in the Church, past and present, leader or otherwise, knows for sure either. There has been no official position on why this was done. Only rampant speculation. Anyone who tries to say that there was an official reason for it is talking out of their ass. All we know for sure is that the leaders were instructed by God to put those restrictions in place, to give a prophecy that they would be lifted at a later date, and then of course later on were instructed to lift them as was said.

I wish I could give a better answer than that, but I don't have one, and to say anything more on this subject and pretend I know what the answer is would be dishonest. And likewise, the Church taking a position on this when nothing has been confirmed yet would be equally dishonest.",1647311611.0,1

This video touches on the subject of the Prophet Muhammad having red hair, as well as the Arabian nobility of his time also having red hair and fair skin and briefly mentions the Egyptian princess who fled to Scotland. This YouTuber makes a bunch of informative and well researched videos about various historical and mythological subjects and I highly recommend his stuff. 

Personally I don’t believe that the racial demographics we have today would be identical with those of the time of JC or Muhammad. That’s ignoring over 2000 years of migrations, military campaigns wars and the rise and fall of half a dozen or so empires.

Just as an example here is a video about the Turkic people and how the country of Turkey came to be where it is today.

In terms of Jesus the literary character he was compiled from several different sources and may have even been inspired by other folks and common myths/legends for the people at that time.


Most of us can say with confidence that Jesus, as he was written about in the Bible and being responsible for miracles and whatnot, did not exist since ya know miracles and such are impossible fantasy.

When I was at my lowest, I thought things had no potential to get better, which was the most painful thing for me. I even called up the suicide hotline and walked them through the logic of why suicide was the logical option. They didn't have anything to say to me. Thankfully I stuck around because my life is fantastic now. If I could have written a story for my future when I was in my 20's (I'm in my 40's now), it would be about the life I am living. And that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't struggled through the rough times.

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren’t appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don’t we spend more time with them, why don’t we go out more, why don’t we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don’t do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven’t done it yet, I probably won’t ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,28

I dont think that person realize how much she effect my life.

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"".

Understand this. An accident outdoors is believable and means your family and friends will be sad but nobody thinks of suicide. That is important because if they did, the pain is much worse and goes on for decades.

The risk as you say is remaining alive with a broken body. People do not always die in a fall which makes this a problem.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,602

He told this man that, because his wife had Alzheimer's, she was basically dead already, so it would be perfectly OK to divorce and remarry.

This absolutely enraged me. My mother had Alzheimer's, plus was pretty much bedbound from a stroke, and a lot more things wrong. When she had her stroke, she told my dad that she'd ""release him from his marriage vows"" and he could leave because she didn't want to be a burden.

He didn't leave. He didn't give her up for dead. Because his VA benefits were shit, and wouldn't pay for a home health care aide, he was her sole caretaker for the last two years of her life. He did everything for her - fed her, cleaned her, gave her meds, dealt with the mood swings and the memory loss, all of it. 

When she was terminally ill, he moved heaven and earth to get her into hospice because he knew she hated the hospital and wouldn't want to die there, even though by that time, she was unresponsive. 

My dad's actions were the epitome of the marriage vow ""in sickness and in health."" Robertson, however, just would have said that she was dead already and to walk away.",1647301889.0,21

Gene LeBell (who was a stunt coordinator for the movie) heard about the claim, and allegedly gave Seagal the opportunity to prove it. LeBell is said to have placed his arms around Seagal's neck, and once Seagal said ""go"", proceeded to choke him unconscious, with Seagal violently evacuating his bowels in the process.[5] After refusing to comment for many years, LeBell circumspectly referred to the story in 2012 when questioned on the matter in an interview; some outlets chose to consider this ""confirmation"" of the story, despite LeBell refusing to directly comment.[6]

My priests were lovely. Couldn’t fiddle kids because there just wouldn’t have been time in the day with all of the actual humanitarian work they had going. If they had been bad people. 

I remember once being 14, drunk, at a house party at 2am where I felt uncomfortable. I couldn’t call my mother, because I lied about where I was that night and didn’t want to get in trouble. 

I needed to get home but had no idea who to call. For some reason I had my youth pastors number, even though I had only gone to youth services once or twice. 

I called him and drunk explained; and he was there in 5 minutes, in sweatpants and clearly just out of sleeping. 

He went through the drive through coffee place and got me a coffee and then talked with me on the 30 minute ride to my parents house. 

It never once felt judgmental. We didn’t talk about god or the Bible per say. 

When I apologized for calling him (despite hardly knowing him) and cried for feeling bad, and cried that my moms Jewish, so I’m not even sure if I’m allowed to ask his help, he nicely told me that it didn’t matter how often I skipped church. Or youth group or if I believed in anything, Old Testament or new. 

That he took the job because he wanted to prove God in the way he was meant to; by being a Good Samaritan and caring about people. And he didn’t mind losing sleep, because bringing me home safely was what Catholicism is about; doing the right thing. 

He never brought it up again, but when I saw him he would greet me warmly and ask how I was. Even if I was a random kid off the street that didn’t have a religion really. 

Some people are just called for that kind of work, and don’t mind living poor and doing good things for no return. They actually practice what they preach.

Yeah, if I go to a church, I should do my part to keep the lights on, but if they're telling me that I can buy my way out of whatever punishment I definitely deserve (I've done some weird shit) by buying the pastor a Cadillac, I don't go for that.

When I didn't want to take any of the available classes, he got the principal to approve a class (Sociology 3, in case you're curious) where it would be just me in the class and he ""taught"" it. I didn't have to do shit but hang out with him for an entire period and got an A. Solid deal.

Well, I graduated at semester and he bought me a grad card. He'd filled every single blank space with tiny writing about how much he loved me and couldn't he just keep me. If he couldn't he was feeling like he would kill himself. 

As I type this now, I'm getting creeped out but at 17 I was too naive to see that for what it was, and I'm only giving you about half the story here. Anyway, that's my crazy friend story. Last I heard he quit his job of 20+ years after I graduated and moved to CO. Idk what happened to him from there. 

EDIT: ok, I'm getting some messages about elaborating on this. To be clear, I don't have any trauma associated with the situation.

The relationship started when I was 15. I went to a tiny rural school and even then I stood out in a crowd. Not a brag, it's relevant to understanding how this all came about. 

The teacher was in his late 40s. Never married, and as I learned later, never even had a girlfriend. Very quiet type. I was going through some things at home and I needed a trusted adult. I was drawn to him and confided several things to him, and he was a true friend when I needed one. You can simultaneously be very beautiful and very lonely, as I learned early in life. I took to spending a lot of time in his room, just talking, playing on the chalkboard, nothing more. 

The next year our talks turned to boys, and he tried to give me some advice about not falling for the BS that high school boys do to get in your pants. He was very critical of boys I dated, always pointing out flaws and such. I started driving that year and that put him on edge because he didn't always know the boys I went out with personally. He was constantly asking if I was ok, was I comfortable doing what boys and girls that age do...it seemed like he was looking out for me, protecting me and I believe he was.

I visited him at his house, but he didn't make advances or anything. He did call me in the evenings and weekends quite a bit. He had a stuffed bear I'd given him which he named after me, usually he'd call to say he and ____Bear missed me. 

My senior year was when we had the 1 on 1 class but again it was just talking although by that point we were so close people noticed it. I think I knew he was in love with me, but he never touched me except for a hug here and there and never asked for anything that would make me uncomfortable. 

Other than the card, he never did anything odd. We confided a lot in each other, and we were two people who needed one another at the time. If I had to do it again I'd make the same choices. I remember when I read the card being deeply sad and sorry for him that I couldn't return the kind of love he had. For me he was a dear friend and nothing more. I remember him fondly and hope he's well, wherever he is.",1647297807.0,223

But the ex said she was going with her kids (we didn’t live together, obviously) to stay at a resort (live in LV) when in fact she was staying at NYNY casino with a truck driver. Said driver got extremely drunk and belligerent the next morning/afternoon and she clearly must have too, because she ended up passing out in his truck cab that evening as he in a rage withheld her phone from her. He evidently discovered the phone video of me and her doing the deed and proceeded to post it on her FB page. 
I started to get texts/ calls around 7pm from friends, then her close friends. Was insanely embarrassing and heartbreaking at the same time. I was in a bar within the hour trying to calm down. 

Since said video was not (because of the angle) breaking any FB decency rules and her being passed out, it took until 10-11am the next day before it was removed. By that time her ex husband (yeah, bizarre) already had a missing persons report with the police. Everyone from her hometown was bugging him and me (most thought I posted it, at first) as to where TF she was.

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off “just over a block” from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn’t recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn’t have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn’t find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it’d be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn’t call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn’t ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn’t believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn’t have money at the time, so I didn’t want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they’d release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I’d been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I’d been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn’t have to pay a fine or take DUI classes.

I reported their conduct to their institution so they knew about it (and apparently they already did and had taken action on some of it already). Professional society said they would tell them to leave me alone and I thought that'd be the end of it.

Every month or so they would harass me online. I ignored it, and documented it. Then out of the blue, an anonymous social media account shows up posting death threats against this colleague, and trying to associate those threats with me - that I was responsible for their life being threatened. This colleague posted on their blog that they were in personal danger, further associating it with me. I sent the anonymous account a link to a webpage that grabbed their IP address and device information- and of course it was them posting fake threats against their self. I caught them in the act.

They are still experiencing the consequences of their own actions, and have learned no lessons to this date. Banned from conferences, job duties changed, and restrictions on activities.

Neither of us were particularly mentally healthy, I was very depressed and he is a narcissist. We had a very tumultuous breakup, I moved away for college and came back a year later. We were friends. He had convinced himself in the time I was gone that we were going to be getting back together, but at that point I’d had enough time away to realize how terribly manipulative and cruel he was the entire time we were together so I was NOT about it. He kept telling me he wouldn’t take no for an answer and he’d convince me. I kinda just ignored him, did my own thing. Hooked up with a mutual friend that I’d known way longer than I knew my ex, it had nothing to do with him but he took it personally.

To my knowledge, there wasn't anything in the toilet but water but it wasn't, like, a sparkly clean toilet either.

I have a lot of opinions about toilet hygiene and it grosses me out when people flush with the lid open because poop mist (or pee mist) is getting EVERYWHERE and the idea of that mist landing on my toothbrush grosses me out.

**The longer answer is**: This was years ago. My ex was visiting my then-partner and I as well as a couple other friends (we were all friends from college). My ex was....deeply disturbed in a lot of ways, and was commenting on how ugly she was in a picture (but really going over the top with descriptions). It was making everyone uncomfortable and finally I asked her to stop.  She looked at me like I had asked her to watch me kill her dog. Hate. Disgust. Anger. But then she stopped and the day continued normally.

In the evening, everyone was leaving. My partner, who I lived with, also left to go somewhere else for the rest of the weekend with friend (who had also been hanging out with us all). I was getting ready for bed and I went to brush my teeth, and in a I-think-my-guardian-angel-is-looking-out-for-me moment, I noticed that my toothbrush was missing, which means that my partner probably took it accidentally. 

I called my partner to tell her about the funny mix-up and when I mentioned that she had taken my toothbrush, I could hear the friend make some noise on the other end of the phone and my partner was like, ""hold on."" There was muffled talking and then my partner came back to me and was like, ""lol isn't that funny about the toothbrush! my bad!"" It was kind of a weird situation, but I let it be.

A couple days later, I had totally forgotten about it all. My partner came home and was like, ""So, you might want to sit down for this."" She proceeded to tell me that my ex was mad at me for asking her to stop saying terrible things about herself and her revenge to me was to swirl my toothbrush in the toilet and leave it for me to use. My partner completely accidentally had taken my toothbrush, and when the friend she was traveling with learned about the mix up, the friend told my ex to throw out the toothbrush and explained why.

Yeah I had a BPD ex who had manipulated the neighbors to see her as the victim and myself (peace loving hippie adjacent at the time) some kind of monster abuser.  Long story short she ended up breaking into my house repeatedly as I slept **even after I screwed all the doors and windows shut from the inside.** Finally after MUCH trouble, drama, courts, and a restraining order, she stopped coming around.

Surprisingly, no matter how much evidence came to public light, people have a hard time mentally exonerating someone they believed was evil and accepting someone they thought was some poor sweet victim is actually sadistically mentally damaged and dangerous.   At best, many people would kind of ""split the difference"" and just assign some manner of truth value to ALL claims and accusations about BOTH parties, no matter how contradictory or mutually exclusive.  Even worse, they'll resent you the VICTIM for the necessity of having to un-believe something they once believed; and will even hold on to an untruth out of pride or pettiness.",1647299222.0,37

As often, it's somewhere between the two. The French Revolution went for 10 years, people change during these years, and some like Robespierre were very reserved so it's hard to know exactly what they had in mind. Also it's such an important event in France's history with such important people, who were praised or vilified depending of which French government was in charge, with so many myths and mysteries, that it is very hard for historians to know what is true and what is not. What was their exact role ? To which degree were they at fault ? For example, there is still a debate about the role of Robespierre in the Vendee genocide. Did he really ordered it himself or was it the generals who went too far ?  Did Marie-Antoinette reveal sensible information to her family in Austria, making her a traitor ? Who was really responsible for the Terror (because Robespierre wasn't the only one in the Public Safety Comitee and the National Assembly...). There was a lot of corruption in the National Assembly, where people often changed sides according to their interests or because of fear. It's a really interesting period to learn about.

Non-French people only know Robespierre because he's the most famous and think he was in charge of everything, but there were other important people (Danton, Desmoulins, Saint-Just, Barras, Couthon, Hébert, Marat, Fouquier-Tinville, etc) who also played a big role and made decisions leading to the Terror, but who are unheard of in other countries.

That was the de Gaulle fiction created after WW2. Once all the details were unfolded it was pretty clear France had collaborated heavily at every level.

Literally on de Gaulle's death the historians of France all pulled hidden histories from under the bed to say ""actually shit didn't work like that"". A lot of WW2 understanding is basically torn between the propaganda fictions of the time and historians trying to put together an accurate understanding of what went on.

Persecution of the Jewish population transformed as countries became secular with religious issues making way for social dawarnism and the competition of races being the fueling factor for their attempts at eradicating them. It is weird when it comes to the term Jewish because it has wider connotations than just religion and makes up their identity much more. That is why people will still describe themselves as Jewish even if they are not practicing due to it being more about their heritage than religion.   


The complication arises from the origin of the term Jewish to denote people frollowing their religion as before the assault of the Assyrians on Israel, they were known as the Israelites and composed a number of tribes. However, the only real surving tribe following the invasion was the tribe of Judah and in some part Benjamin who were absorbed by the former. As a result the term Judah was adapted and adopted as the denotion for anyone following the religion. Whilst, it is why the term Jewish is in a grey area when it comes to what it denotes as many will trace their lineage to this original tribe as a sort of racial heritage.",1647307172.0,17

1.	The face buttons (aka the four buttons on the right) are always lined up in cardinal directions (and for the sake of this I’ll refer to them as such)
2.	“Confirm” is usually the “south” button in majority western games. It’s occasionally the “East” button in Japanese developed games and  Nintendo games. 
3.	“Cancel” is typically the inverse of the above. 
4.	“Triggers” are always the rear most buttons on the top. These are your RT/R2/RZ
5.	the shoulder or top lost buttons are the “non-triggers”. So I generally think of them as shoulder buttons. So when I see RB/R1/R I always think shoulders aka “non-triggers”. 
7.	The menu buttons in the middle of the controller, no matter what I pretty much always call them “Start” and “Select”. Everyone usually knows what I mean because that only changed recently and fuck that change. 
8.	If I play a game that’s on different platforms, the “North” and “West” buttons typically do the same things across all platforms.

So if I’m playing a game like Apex Legends, “South” is always Jump or Ability and confirm. “East” is always crouch or cancel. “West” always is Use or Reload, “North” is always weapon swap. The only weird one is occasionally some Playstation games swap R1 and R2 functions so that they’re opposite of what other consoles do but that’s rare. 

This probably helps no one but once the consistency is realised, it’s much less about 

>	Press A to Jump

“Where’s A!?!?”

And more like 

“Ok so ‘South’ is jump like in every other game and system I’ve played”. 

Or 

>	Square [] Is attack

“Ok so ‘West’ is attack like every game”. 

Worse comes to worse I reconfigure to match as well. Like I actually change Jump in most arena or Deathmatch shooters to L1/LB/L.

I don’t refer to them as NSEW in my head it’s usually “the button on the left/right/up/down” like the Dpad but on the right hand side. The Switch utilises this best on the joy cons.",1647294039.0,2

This is best, keeps their teeth in shape and loads of nutrients.  Peanuts are not nuts, they are legumes and not ideal for squirrel nutrition..

Squirrels are omnivores, but the best thing for him to keep going in the winter are nuts. Not sure that prezels, with tons of salt are very good for him.

Building a squirrel box in your backyard would be great so he/she can ride out the winter. They build winter nests of leaves/hair other materials, but these can get blown down in a hard winter. Natural cavities in trees are also great places of refuge for them.",1647297848.0,74

Wife and I have been feeding this squirrel for a few years now. We can tell it’s the same one because it has this scar on its side.

She was pretty skittish at first but we’ve gained her trust over time. Nowadays we’ll see her at our back door in the morning. We keep a bag of peanuts there to feed her. So we’ll open the door before grabbing the bag and she just straight up comes in our house and sits at our feet waiting for us to give her peanuts.

They arent meant to keep inside. Only time thats ok is for rehabilitation or rescue of an injured animal. They are meant to be wild. 

I love animals and the best way to show that, is to let wild animals remain wild and enjoy them in their natural habitat. 

FYI: Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other forms of direct contact with infected squirrels. Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid. Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease, Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. - googled information.",1647282736.0,8

For example, 2019 saw The Cure, Radiohead, The Zombies all admitted. All totally deserving, but it was Radiohead's first year of eligibility while the others were obviously overdue. It wouldn't have been the worst thing if Radiohead was held off for a few years and, say, Iron Maiden was admitted instead. That being said Radiohead is on a short list of bands that do deserve admission asap.",1647294320.0,3

I remember when Fiona Apple's ""Shameika"" won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance, and people were up in arms about it not really being Rock.  I really like the song.  I still have no idea whether it's really Rock or not.  But every 10 years or so, a totally new music emerges and becomes part of ""Rock and Roll"".  If your definition of Rock and Roll is Chuck Berry, you might be surprised by the Beatles ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", even though they were big fans of Chuck Berry.  If your definition of Rock and Roll is the Beatles, you might be surprised by funk emerging in the 70s.  (Actually I remember this discussion coming up separately on reddit once, of whether or not funk is rock.  To me it is, at least...)  If your definition is funk, you'll be surprised by New Wave.  If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

If I were to try to define Rock and Roll, maybe some of the key features are that it is loud and features guitars, but neither of these things are actually essential.

Hell, a lot of those early soul groups got their start as doo wop groups like the Miracles and Marvin Gaye started as doo wop artists. Otis Redding even took a lot of influence and began as a Little Richard imitator and if you listen to see some slower Little Richard songs like Send Me Some Lovin' sounds like soul.

For those unaware, as Cash got popular, he was invited to play a private show for president Nixon and other high profile members of society. 

The Nixon admin thought it’d be a safe bet, because he played old boy, country music and wouldn’t have to worry about all the anti-war criticism being leveled at him at the time for Vietnam. Nixon hated the hippies and their anti-war sensibilities, so getting a show by good ol country boy Johnny Cash should have been a safe bet.

We know this isn't true, though. The same factors that caused them to be radicalized by right-wing conspiracist nonsense are the factors that prevent them from recovering from that spiral of radicalization.

The ***overwhelming*** majority of the time, once a person is radicalized, they will remain radicalized for the rest of their life. We don't know a way to reliably de-radicalize people at scale. The only intervention with ***any*** observed success is to engage them in painstakingly patient conversation over a period of months or years, and even then the likelihood of that working is depressingly low. It's a difficult truth to accept, but it simply isn't worth trying to rescue radicalized people. Once they're radicalized, all you can really hope to do is limit the harm they can cause by isolating and marginalizing them so that they are prevented from radicalizing anyone else.

If you want to fight right-wing radicalization, the way to do that is to prevent vulnerable people from becoming radicalized in the first place. That means ***dramatically*** increasing funding for public education, and relentlessly supporting crucial democratic institutions like the free press, voting rights, rule of law, etc.",1647291409.0,9

B) but more importantly, because there is a very obvious right and wrong here. Russia invaded. Ukraine defended. Russia has given no evidence to show why their invasion of a sovereign nation was justified. Ukraine is defending their country, which is justification enough to fight. Russia has committed acts that go far beyond the constraints of war (bombing hospitals, breaking negotiated ceasefires, etc). Ukraine isn't attacking Russia, and is indeed treating Russian prisoners decently by all accounts. If Russia gets to annex Ukraine, it has wide reaching implications for other sovereign areas that Russia would like to reclaim, and eventually for the world. If Ukraine maintains freedom, no one is threatened but Russia, and even then only because they want to take over Ukraine.

So even if we believe that Zelenskyy is actually an awful guy, that doesn't actually justify Russia attacking the country. Especially knowing what we know about how Putin has run Russia. The Russians suffering over this isn't a strike against Zelenskyy... it's another against Putin.

However, Downtown Houston and particularly Downtown Dallas both have pretty good walking scores. Downtown Dallas was a bunch of deserted office skyscrapers when I lived there but I hear it has gotten better.

EDIT: Since people are getting confused, Houston and Dallas being ranked 24th and 26th walkability score of large American cities is a VERY BAD ranking. The website is saying that Dallas and Houston are car dependent and UNWALKABLE. So everyone replying saying, ""That website is wrong! Houston and Dallas are terrible to walk!"" Yes, that's exactly what the website is also saying. The ""downtown"" neighborhoods that have decent walk scores are pretty small areas of both Dallas and Houston which are only a handful of blocks large.

Then it's 100°+ in the shade everyday for like 5 months. They get a winter now though for maybe a month which they are still not prepared; no infrastructure really and stores don't stock much for ice removal or anything like that. 

During the freeze last year we were standing in line to cut up untreated lumber to burn, for the few that could skid down the road to the lowes. I think we were out of propane too. I found one small tank and used a blow torch to defrost drain pipes. You have to drip faucets all winter so they don't freeze but during the power outage, that froze up the drains. 

Anyway, we're closing on our house there soon hopefully and already left for good. The power outage and the following pipe bursts was the final straw on an already broken back. 

Fuck Dallas and most of Texas and the whole Texas State government and US Congress idiots. They get what they voted for now. Good luck.

Anyway, I had to come up with the messages and my night maintenance guy changed the letters on the sign for me. He hated the sign more than all of us combined. One day I offhandedly told him what we should put up as a joke and he, for the rest of his time working there would periodically ask if we could put up that message which I always had to say no to.

Here are a few of the reasons for that feeling:

- the sweater pattern is mechanical and all aligned, which wouldn't be the case on a real sweater

- the sweater and shirt both feel composited in, and the shirt is both in and out of focus

- focus drifts and disagrees at different points: for example, her ear (and neck) is out of focus but the hair in front of and behind her ear are both in focus

- the coloration of her face is splotchy and transitions abruptly from olive to rosy and back again",1647258472.0,57

Remini has already been discussed, but I am unfamiliar with it (I imagine it's similar to DFDNet). Recently with stylegan2 some interesting ideas have been implemented. One with particular promise is time-travel re-photography in which the latent space is queried for a similar looking face to the input image, and then the AI face is converged toward the input image.  

[AI Comparisons of this face](https://i.imgur.com/W6bUmq0.jpg)   

I would say the GFPGAN output actually produces a really believable result and better represents that age of the subject (I think there is a decade of difference across these photos).

Very nice job. 
One thing I would consider working on is the background and levels. The thing that has the most artificial impression overall is the background fading into black in the lower left of the picture, because it contrasts with her very colorful cheeck which is receiving light from that area. its much brighter in the original source. I can see the stylistic choice you might have made for a portrait shot, but it might require darkening the cheek just a litte bit. very fine hair on the cheek receiving backlight to add a smooth fade for the silhouette might help sell it even more.",1647260480.0,1

However, I think that it is important to colorize photos, especially in a historical sense. Most people's historical reference point starts with their birth. When they see a b&w photo of say Ruby Bridges as a child being escorted, the technology to produce the original photo gives it an ancient, 'so long ago' reference. When viewing the same photo of Ruby Bridges being escorted, but this time in color, gives the photo the right historical framework as in 'not that long ago'.

1. It looks like there is a curl of her hair in the original that has been removed/confused with background plant life - would be good to add that back in as it looks a bit too clean on that side
2. As a result of this, the 'indent' around the outside corner of her right eye is also absent, giving it a less naturally rounded appearance. As a result it looks like her cheek is basically in line with her brow/forehead rather than curving in at the top.

I see that her sweater is green.  Was that an educated guess?  Was it computer-assisted? There used to be a bot here on reddit that did a really good job (by machine learning standards) colorizing b/w images. 

There is a colorized image of our fire department from the 1920s in my local bank that drives me nuts. Whoever colorized it made the New Jersey flag red instead of yellow. Although, it's also clear that it was done before modern computer tools.

1. Fix any photo damage and over exposed areas.
2. Expand the image for better composition and fill out the areas that need to be. I did that in this case but ended up replacing the entire background anyway coz there was barely anything there.
3. Remove noise as much as possible while trying not to wash out information in order to be able to used later.
4. Spend hours trying to find the closest high quality replacement from stock photos for all the facial features / skin / hair / and other stuff in the photo.
5. Spend more time trying to morph and blend them all to match with the original as much as possible. Improvise when there's no information. Spend a lot of time on this step because the more accurate you can make it, the better the final result will be.
6. Do a base color coating on the entire image.
7. Study the materials in the image and try to overpaint on all of them trying to replicate the material effects -- glossiness, refraction, reflections, specular detail, subsurface scattering for the skin and transparent materials and etc. The more time spent on this, the more realistic the final image will be.
8. Add noise and some intentional photo distortion to make it look like a photo and less like an overpainted image
9. Get lazy after all that work and find hackjobs for less important areas coz it can get tiring.
10. Do a final color grade / lighting fix / overpaint to fix anything that stands out too much.
11. Save and post to reddit.

Here's a WIP GIF of another restoration I did a while ago. This is not the same kind of restoration work as the OP ..but it does kind of outline my process a bit. This one is missing an entire overpaint layer that I now do for skin and etc. [https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4)

I mean, there is a picture there of people farming in bright red shirts! Lots of color wasn't just some luxury thing in past centuries, it was as normal as today. Obviously we have more choices and ways of imparting colors, but people regularly wore colorful clothing in the past too, all over the world. And decorated their surroundings in bright colors. Black and white photos are great, because the alternative is almost entirely either nothing, or portraits of the rich. The portraits do show us the colors they had available, but they are biased because they're being paid for, and they create bias in us because the only color we see is worn by the aristocracy. It is also part of the reason that I like Vincent van Gogh's work - he shows how things of his day *felt.* You can look at his work and know what it was like to be where and when he was and it is beautiful.",1647269908.0,106

Oddly enough media depicting ancient history often is more colorful and bright, and there is a far greater spectrum ‘life’ happening. It’s not until the middle ages that things are just…monochromatic.

Fantasy novels especially fall victim to this narrative. This dark and dreary monochrome world where everything is just glum and horrible.

The change in my world from 0-10 may have been incredible from a scientific view, or an outsider's view...but for me, it goes from being a kid, to still being a kid..  From 10-20, though, enough personal change happens that it could easily be broken into multiple time/emotional groups.  From 20's on out...my views have changed, my circumstances have changed, my lifestyle has changed...but in perspective, I still feel the same person.  So time doesn't feel as impactful.

So things that happened 10 years ago to me, feel very much like they could have only happened last year.  The passing of time just doesn't hit as strongly.  There is little difference from one year to another.  (Taking out huge milestones like the pandemic, 9/11, etc...just considering day to day events)

But as a kid, each year or two years brought about a lot more change.  So time and individual time periods had greater impact.  So that is my perspective on passing time, where I felt it having more of an impact in my life.  During that time, 50 years prior was the 1930's.  Intellectually, I know that is now nearly 100 years ago...but emotionally, it still feels that same 50 yr period as it did when I was coming to terms with life and everything about it.

Time is definitely relative.  And perception becomes one's reality.",1647266035.0,10

In the process, they penetrated very deeply into Rosneft Deutschland’s systems. So deep, in fact, that they easily found backups of employees’ and executives’ laptops.

As far as the backed up data is concerned, one simply has to be satisfied with the nearly 20 terabytes pulled last week. Included are complete hard disk images of employee laptops and computers, hard disk images of a mail server (34GB), many archive files (ZIP, TAR.GZ and 7Z), CSV, XLSX, DOC and of course software packages, manuals, license keys for software, and – because everything is Microsoft Windows – thousands of DLLs.""",1647289890.0,5540

If you have a specific target as a part of contract, it's specific and it's hit/miss almost randomly, sometimes you can't get anything really at all and sometimes you will own a complete state-wide network of a huge insurance company with admin access in 2 days in 2 person team.

If you don't have a specific target, it's much easier ""to hack something"", there are so many targets. Also you will only report the successful hacks, not the unsuccessful ones. So behind huge hack there have been many other attempts at other things. It would be just too boring to list all the things you tried and not newsworthy (hence why pentesters hate writing reports). If you made a real movie about it, mostly it's a lot of sitting and almost mind-numbing trying like 99% and maybe 1% action.

Given the stakes and resolve, this changes from ""stupid DDoS"" to something much else even if you don't hire anyone as government.

All old crusty badly configured VPNs which haven't been upgraded in years, operating systems which haven't been upgraded in years. VMWare so out of date it is hard to get modern OSs installed on it, and so on.

From what I could see they had three layers of security:

* Old odd software which is unlikely to be in the average kali like toolkit.

* Such weird configurations of VPNs and networking that it is easy to get lost even when you are invited.

* All running on hardware which the average toolkit/hacker is not going to be super familiar such as VAX/VMS (yes in 2022), Solaris, HPUX, etc. Usually, a mix from many eras. Some old servers/networking gear from the 90s or before and everything inbetween up to and including some new local cloud stuff. Often each of these upgrades was because they bought something new which wouldn't run at all on their old style crap. So instead of upgrading everything they would shove a few new servers in with the new stuff and the let it sit and rot. 

As for good practices like honeypots or even backups these places are swamps of bad IT so nothing like that. I am not exaggerating to say some of these multi billion dollar operations could be down for days with a single drive failure. Often they have redundant systems where ""backup"" server is just corrupted junk because the system making it redundant failed 3 years ago. Their attitude is to put it on a list and not worry as the ""good"" server is fine right now. Even better are those redundant systems where if the master server corrupts it will probably happily corrupt the backup servers. The backup servers which don't actually have backups.

Best part is if you ask them about their security they will brag about it being impregnable. ""Three layers of VPNs. Firewalls, secure server rooms, multiple redundant everything."" This is a case of where they don't have a clue of all the things they don't know.

Also, quite a bit of their stuff is very custom built. Thus installing it can be involved and highly hardware dependant. I have seen industrial installations where the guys installing it have the source code open in visual studio working on a live system.",1647306636.0,2

For instance, one laptop could have a 2TB image, while that image only has 250Gb of data and 240GB of it is system files. And I frequently work with single email accounts that are larger than 34GB. And seeing that it was a whole mail server under 34GB, that leads me to believe it's either very old, or it's not actually an image of a whole mail server and only a few targeted accounts from it. (But is named to appear to be a whole image, which has yet to be confirmed/verified content-wise.)

In fact, there's a very good chance that what they obtained was the data related to a single legal hold that was being handled in relation to a lawsuit and discovery request.

A DLL is a non directly executable binary file which holds the compiled contents of a library of functions (code). They are specific to Windows and are started by various processes including Windows itself. They make it possible build applications out of existing building blocks by using an existing DLL. In contrast to a .DLL is a .LIB which contains uncompiled code, a text file (usually headers). One major benefit of DLL is that it’s compiled independently on the application depending on it. That means the DLL author can ensure the optimization instead of passing that to the consumer. Another perceived benefit of DLL is that it’s harder to reverse engineer and is often times used in conjunction with obfuscation. This is not really true for anyone smart or dedicated enough though.

There is arguably potential value in having the reverse engineered DLL source code of this oil company. Just conjecture but I could believe it.",1647307064.0,2

Everyone backs up the VM images but backing up the VM machine itself and all it's custom config along with the storage arrays are easily forgotten, not automated, and likely outdated.

They fester this attitude so that fewer people are likely to even bother looking at the truth, which limits its spread. If people refuse, as a culture, as a society, to acknowledge the truth because they think it has no value then the truth dies. And propaganda, totalitarians, etc know this, they intentionally spread the lie that the well of truth has dried up so that no one goes to it. We should be mindful of the spread of this attitude that truth has no value and doesn't matter.

Here’s the thing, anyone that is truly paying attention already knows the overall answers. Everyone in my life that follows politics and has for many years connected the dots and will hardly talk about it now or unplugged completely because it’s too fucked up to deal with and no one who can do anything is doing anything, not even calling it out.I mean plenty of academics, sociologists, political scientists have called it out but no one with enough power to fix anything has stood us and said the plain truth: 

*America we’ve were compromised by Russian operatives and assets and for four years they had the keys to the kingdom and of we don’t stop it we will collapse.*

So the thing is, if we saw it all together, in writing, with  undeniable proof, would we do something  or just go back to Netflix? Shouldn’t the Panama papers have started a world wide rebellion? 

My extremely educated uncle mentioned the other week how so many of the biggest mouthpieces have been outted as fascists that want to install a dictatorship and work with Russia like it was the first time he said it out loud. I looked at him and said “yeah we and our kids are going  to have to kick ass( our kids are adults) and he just looked at the ground and said “I think it’s too late”. There were probably 7 or 8 highly political people in the room (family funeral) and not one person said a word. That moment scared me more than any other so far. Even my young adult nephews that have masters in history just stared ahead. 

Are we too tired, too afraid, too beaten down? Are we just so demoralized by 50+ years of fighting in good faith with people that not only aren’t using good faith they use every dirty trick in the world to put on a pretend play while literally driving their supporters into madness. And also, who exactly is fighting on our side? Anyone?

No.

Those sites are just a way to make advertising revenue off of people's ignorance.

People get a ""Cannot find Entry Point..."" error and lock onto the dll and figure ""ahh! Of course, I can just replace it with a newer version!"" they do a google search, land on dll-files.com or whatever, and oh, good! there are 20 different versions of gdi32.dll (why the FUCK do they have that file at all?). Well, they pick one and then they go down the rabbit hole of forcibly replacing gdi32.dll on their computer and make it unbootable. 

or, taking the old game example, maybe the error is that mvscr90.dll cannot be found.

So a user google searches and oh look, lost-dll-files.com and dll-files-for-less.com and dll-files.com and free-dll-files.net and who knows who else has it for free download! Surely,  that is the solution right?

No. The ""solution"" is to install the Visual C++ 2008 redistributable.

or maybe the error is that ""mfc42u.dll"" could not be found. Same story. Except you need the Visual C++ 6.0 redistributable.

Hell, just looking into that specific game and I'm finding shitloads of bad advice. Dinput.dll missing? oh, here, download this random fucking zip file and extract it.

Like, no. Just install DirectX 9.0c.

Hacktivists hack shit, tell the world, exfiltrate data and show everyone. The CIA would gain access, maintain persistent access for likely as long as possible, and it'd be some TLP Red shit that only a few people know about. Imagine some 45 year old CIA executive being like ""oh yeah take that super secret data and leak it to the whole world, likely burning our persistent access, fuck it. That'll show Putin."" Dumping a fuckload of questionably useful data is more of a hacktivist show off thing.

If several of their oil rigs suddenly stopped working and they discovered the source was malware, I'd think it's likely intelligence agencies. If it's just a data dump, unless there's a real and obvious goal that weakens something, I doubt it.

Intelligence agencies are stealthy until real and useful damage can be done. Hacktivists are ""release everything to the public whatever we can exfiltrate"". I mean, look at stuxnet. It fucked up Iran's nuclear program. That shit is more their style. It was a surgical strike.

Mike Pence could very well have been the next link in the Reagan - GHWB - GWB chain that masks the right's evil under the veil of boring legitimacy, while slowly chipping away at our rights.

Trump basically stole their plausible deniability. He took all the racism and ignorance that was always there, but neatly tucked away, and put it center stage. He forced middle Americans to take a side. Now we have a tough fight on our hands, maybe an unwinnable one but at least its a fight.

Not 'nation' or 'the government right now', but civilization as a whole.  Once things are safe enough that the investment in critical thinking and resisting intuition in favor of reason, it no longer makes sense to go to that trouble.  So, people don't.  Eventually it becomes hard to get public support for expanding the infrastructure protecting people, then it gets harder to get support for maintaining the infrastructure, then things start breaking and the dangers everything was set up to protect people from re-emerge.  We know what happens then, it's like clockwork.  People double down.  They blame what remains of the infrastructure as actually causing the danger.  And they start actively dismantling it.  As things become less and less safe, they triple down, quadruple down, etc, accelerating the tearing down.  Eventually, humanity returns to its base state, racked with disease, starving from famine, slogging through the mud killing each other over whose god is stronger.  Before you say 'no, people will course-correct and become reasonable again', I ask you: Do you see calls to abandon the emotional, intuitive approaches to life and invest instead in science and reason on a significant scale?  We removed the very thing that motivated going against intuition, danger, and HAD to do so.  Failing to remove danger wouldn't be civilization.

And the reason they are so concerned if you're dishonest is not because they want to be sure they know everything about you.  It's because they don't want you to be blackmailable.  If you won't talk about it when background checking for your job, then if someone external approached you with info about it and said they would tell your boss and cost you your job and probably worse unless you gave them some innocuous-sounding intel, you probably would.  Obviously you might not give them the nuclear launch codes but that's not how shit really works.  They don't ask for recognizably dangerous information until after forming a relationship with you based on that initial foot in the door - they wait until you're so deep in it that they could nuke you completely if you stopped cooperating.

What you said is important and maybe exactly right. If y’all want to fight, I’m here for it. I’d happily go out fighting fascists, the one thing they have never been able to take is the humanity we have and they lack and they know it’s something they want to destroy but can’t even identify. I can live with this ending even if we lose but the idea that we just sit and get absorbed into the fray is the most depressing thought I’ve ever had. Seriously. Nothing is more depressing than humanity just rolling over. 


This conversation makes me think of one of the funniest books I’ve ever read, written by Mikhail Bulgakov while he was living in Stalin’s Soviet Union (his wife was able to only publish it 25 years after his death) , people think these people we deal with can’t be evil because they are stupid and they do and say ridiculous things but Mikhail said all fascism is that way. The book reads a bit like a dark Alice in Wonderland but Alice is Satan and also Stalin and his sidekick is a humongous talking cat.

Even if Russia didn't have veto power, it probably wouldn't happen. The UN has no army of it's own, when a resolution calling for peacekeeping passes, the UN sends out a request to member countries to provide troops and equipment. 

Say Russia had a hissy fit and missed this vote and it passed. What would happen? The UN would call for a peacekeeping NFZ, and ask the member nations for troops. Biden's already said the US won't send troops unless NATO gets attacked, so the US wouldn't send their troops - so there goes the largest air force (one could argue ""there goes 4 of the top 5 air forces,"" in terms of both aircraft number and power, the US AF is the strongest air force, second is the US Navy, fourth is the US Army, and fifth is the US Marines). The second largest is Russia's, they're not sending troops to enforce a NFZ against themselves. The third largest is China's, they're ""neutral"" (soft-pro Russian), the fourth is India's, also ""neutral."" Fifth is Egypt, they're probably not going to send in their planes. Sixth is North Korea, which voted in Russia's favor over the Ukraine invasion. Seventh is South Korea. Somewhat doubt they'll try to send planes to Ukraine on basically the other side of the world, eighth largest is Pakistan (also neutral), ninth largest is Japan, but they have a ban on their military getting involved in foreign engagements, also, other side of the world. And tenth is the Saudi Air Force.

On top of that you'd need air fields or aircraft carriers. The Baltic states or Poland have airfields close enough, but the Baltic states are likely to face invasion if they permit airfield use (and this would probably not trigger article 5). As for aircraft carriers: the US has 11, but has said they'll sit this one out, China, India, and Russia obviously won't send theirs, so that leaves the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Thailand.

NATO may be intended by some member states as a defensive alliance, and Articly 5 is a big part of its founding treaty, but nowhere does the North Atlantic Treaty specify that NATO is a defensive alliance or restrict its institutions into only fighting defensive conflicts.Obviously, claiming you're a defensive alliance is good to prevent escalation and I don't think it's a good idea to establish a no-fly zone, but it's not technically true that NATO's hands are tied.",1647299945.0,13

If Russia overruns the Baltics before NATO can react (and they probably can if they tried), they can present NATO with a fait accompli, making them choose between two unpalatable options: either to fight a bloody counteroffensive and risk nuclear escalation, essentially risking New York to save Tallinn, or to concede and accept the consequences (the collapse of NATO and a new Cold War, most likely).

We don’t know which choice NATO will make until it happens. But the more likely Russia thinks the former will happen, the less likely they will actually do this, and this is why a show of force, showing that we *are* willing to accept the risks of escalation is important: it upholds NATO’s credibility as a deterrent. Conversely, if we allow Ukraine to fall, giving up major interests in the area - that sends the signal that we are averse to escalation, undermines our credibility, and increases the chance that Russia would actually try something in the Baltics or elsewhere.

The people mindlessly parroting “we won’t defend Ukraine because we don’t want to risk nuclear war, but we definitely *will* risk nuclear war to defend a fellow NATO country” apparently think that Article 5 is some kind of Word of God that can override all other considerations and magically compel NATO members to act, but that simply isn’t the case, the risks of being outmaneuvered are very real.

Realistically Russia has a few hundred 4th generation fighters and a large amount of 1970s/1980s stuff that wasn't even that good at the time and it's been pretty clear their air force is just as much of a mess as their army from how it's been performing in Ukraine.  As for airfields Northern and Eastern Europe is littered with them from the Cold War and all the different countries military bases so I doubt this would be a major issue.  Aircraft carriers would be unlikely to play a significant role as the only place they would be of use would be if it came to retaking Crimea and entering the Black Sea would likely mean a naval conflict.  I suspect European air forces also have much better AWAC capability, maintenance, pilot training and munitions than the Russians which would play a part.

Another factor that would come into play is whether the US stayed neutral or not I would expect they would significantly speed up the delivery of the 100+ F-35Bs that the UK has on order as well as providing other passive support.

>Also, any country or coalition could try to establish a NFZ without the UN calling for it, if they aren't already, don't see why a UN request would change that.

The reason the UN endorsement is important is that it makes it a legal enterprise.  Establishing one with out it just a military force securing air space rather than a No Fly Zone which typically has some legal authority behind it.

  NATO added four battalion-sized battlegroups to the defense of the Baltic states last month to supplement the ~4k NATO troops already there, added to the dozens of combat aircraft that are based there and patrol regularly, the US added 4k more troops to their presence in Poland, and the presence of NATO forces in eastern Europe in general has increased dramatically over the last month. The Baltics getting easily overrun was probably a realistic possibility before Putin decided to invade Ukraine, but all eyes are pointed east so there's no advantage of surprise to be had right now. I suspect we'll see NATO's presence in eastern Europe remaining high for the forseeable future exactly to guard against any NATO nations getting overrun.  

  There's also the point to consider that the war in Ukraine has greatly exposed the overestimated military capacity of Russia to wage a land war in Europe, and in particular support that war from the air. While the fighting spirit of Ukraine's military is admirable, on paper this war should have been a decisive victory for Russia instead of a slow and expensive slog fought a kilometer of Ukranian soil at a time.

If NATO started to invade Russia than the likelihood of a nuclear strike happening increases, of course a nuclear attack within a NATO country could result in a equal force directed at Russia so the first nuke from Russia (IF they used one) would probably be Ukraine, from there it is anyone's guess to what will happen, it is a massive risk from Russia to launch a nuclear weapon.

Of course this is considering the fact that Russia actually attacks a NATO member or NATO put in place a no fly zone, also we have to consider if NATO gets involved what will other countries do, what will China do? Get involved? Attack Taiwan? What will India do? What will Belarus do? Etc...

Quite a lot of uncertainties but NATO would defend themselves but probably not invade Russia, but I would imagine them pushing into Ukraine.",1647283245.0,10

I have a hard time believing Putin ends all life because we defended Ukraine. If we March on Moscow and start bombing sites deep in Russian territory, maybe he would. But defending Ukraine is questionable. Odds are the generals don't even go along with it if he decided to launch over that either, a Soviet Submarine commander defied protocol once before and literally saved the world. There IS precedent there for that scenario to happen again. 

If Russia uses chemical weapons NATO has to close the skies imo. There is a point we have to step up. I'm sick of the world living in fear of Putin and whether he'll push the button. It's time for him to start living in fear of what the west can achieve when we are unified.",1647283334.0,25

Considering this has never happened before, I am not sure why you're stating it like it's a fact. This is your opinion and mostly conjecture. For all we know, Nato could join the fight in Ukraine and Russia would just back down and leave. It's just as equally likely. 

> How many people including myself saw the amassing of troops as a bluff?

Literally everyone who was paying attention did not see it as a bluff. You do not spend that much time and money putting so much of your infantry and equipment next to a boarder unless you plan to attack. Every expert was saying the attack was going to happen unless someone could talk some sense into Putin, which was unlikely. 

>He invaded Ukrainian for gods sake what makes you think he’s bluffing about nukes?

Because he first invaded Ukraine in 2014 and the world did basically nothing. Some talks were had, some sanctions put in place by the US, but overall the world turned away and ignored it.... So, he obviously expected the same results. He's spent the last 30 years getting away with whatever he wanted and it's pretty obvious he was not expecting this kind of response from the rest of the world.

Using nukes only has 1 result for Putin. Death. And he knows that.

>If no fly zone is implemented it could trigger a chain of reactions that leads to the worst case scenario

So could arming the people of Ukraine, or implementing sanctions, or seizing Russian assets. It's all calculated risks and a delicate balancing act. But, the fact that the world has managed to basically harm Russia financially to the point of pushing them back towards the brink of collapse, and there's still no escalation outside of Ukraine, is a pretty big indicator that jumping to Nuclear isn't something Russia is anxious to do.

Salt is definitely still available as I bought a pack just a few days ago. Russian salt (the cheap kind) has been removed from the shelves, or the retailers will not buy more of it and sell off the stock (some donating all the profits to Ukraine). Maybe some people panic a little, but people are mostly calm and at least in my bubble feel relatively safe. Different commanders of our military have been on the TV (mostly) every evening and give a professional overview of the events, trying to explain the events of the war from their POV.

Buckwheat  and flour - haven't checked but there has been nothing of it being out of stock on the news. I guess ill check it out next time I'm at a grocery store, but I suspect that there are no supply issues.

Some members of the Russian speaking minority definitely have been brainwashed by the Russian state media, but a great deal of the Russian speaking populace (especially younger and more educated lot) is very much pro Estonian and anti Putin.

Putin will continue flying planes in a no-fly zone, which means an instant escalation to a full-blown conflict between NATO and Russia. Plus the anti-aircraft systems that Russia is using against Ukrainians aren't just placed in Ukraine, they are also placed along the Russian border.

A lot of other smaller places as well are great. Cute little towns with castle ruins everywhere. Manors and churches everywhere.

The Russian armed forces just don't have the manpower for urban warfare on any scale.

If Russia ever decided to invade the Baltics then the lesson of Ukraine is that NATO would take out the railheads inside Russia and wait for the invasion force that's incapable of taking over cities to run out of food and fuel, then accept their surrender once they're done sightseeing the countryside.  Russia using tactical nukes in such a situation would if anything degrade their ability to supply their forces, so there'd be no point unless suicide-by-nuclear-response is their aim.

He won't nuke Ukraine, either.  There's too much of a tactical and resource advantage to be had for Russia to re-absorb Ukraine.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90’s.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

And just look at The Fellowship of the Ring! That is a gory ass movie. Had the Orcs and Goblins been humans it would've been a hard R, but because they're fantasy creatures that bleed black it could be PG-13.",1647311622.0,10

That is literally all I can think of...the age old 'race grifter' rearing his ugly head is the only thing that makes sense.Think about it, someone has to sell the bed sheets to the Klan.

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,18

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?'

They know next to nothing as a rule about their own history, or the histories of other nations, or the histories of the various social movements that have risen and fallen in the past, and they certainly know little or nothing of the complexities and contradictions comprised within words like “socialism” and “capitalism.” Chiefly, what they have been trained not to know or even suspect is that, in many ways, they enjoy far fewer freedoms, and suffer under a more intrusive centralized state, than do the citizens of countries with more vigorous social-democratic institutions. This is at once the most comic and most tragic aspect of the excitable alarm that talk of social democracy or democratic socialism can elicit on these shores.

>An enormous number of Americans have been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than, say, Germans or Danes precisely because they possess far fewer freedoms in the concrete. They are far more vulnerable to medical and financial crisis, far more likely to receive inadequate health coverage, far more prone to irreparable insolvency, far more unprotected against predatory creditors, far more subject to income inequality, and so forth, while effectively paying more in tax (when one figures in federal, state, local, and sales taxes, and then compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country, as almost nowhere else, their taxes do not cover). One might think that a people who once rebelled against the mightiest empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services. But we accept what we have become used to, I suppose. Even so, one has to ask, what state apparatus in the “free” world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens while providing no substantial civic benefits in return, solely in order to enrich a piratically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the immensely wealthy?

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

I’m certainly not rich but I grew up with absolutely nothing and live a very comfortable life now. 

For some context, I was raised by a single parent who was a disabled Vietnam vet and unable to work. While he did get a VA disability check, it was only a partial disability because of an arm injury. His real disability was PTSD resulting in a lifelong battle with alcohol. He was later classified as fully disabled but that was after I was out of the house. We lived in a single room shack that was about 15 feet by 10 feet. My father slept in a lazy boy and had a cot. There were no appliances. We had a microwave and a fridge that was about 2 feet by 2 feet. We mostly didn’t have running water because the bill wouldn’t get paid. 

I had ok grades in high school and went to an in-state public university. I was able to afford it because tuition was really low, I got grants, some student loans, and worked. I did ok on my GPA but nothing stellar by any means and graduated with my BBA in finance. I immediately got a job out of college making a very good salary. 

I worked in that job for two years and then went back to a different in-state public university to get my MBA with a concentration in financial analysis. Again, being in-state and public, the tuition was quite reasonable. I did ok and got decent grades. I also passed the first two levels of the CFA while in graduate school. That wasn’t an expensive designation to pursue. 

When I graduated, I immediately got a job making almost three times what I was making before. I’ve been at that same company for over 15 years. Now, I make three to four times the amount I did when I started. 

None of this was that difficult (except the CFA). I didn’t go to top tier schools, I didn’t have a 4.0 GPA, I didn’t go into serious debt. It was so damned easy to DRASTICALLY improve my situation. 

My wife basically did the same thing. She grew up above the poverty line but not by much. She went to the same schools I did, got her Masters in accounting, and went to work in audit at a big 4 firm.

It shows less mobility in the States than in europe. But the perception is its the reverse.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,47

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

I've got a friend, initials DID, who grew up in a trailer park to first gen Trinidadian immigrant parents who speak with heavy accents, so zero privilege. In 5th grade, DID's teacher thinks he's pretty smart and he should do an international baccalaureate (IB) preparedness program at a magnet middle school (harder middle school classes to prepare for harder high school classes). DID convinced his parents to sign the forms, which they only do because the school is a magnet program so he'll be added to a bus route and they won't have to take him to the miles further away middle school.  
  
During 8th grade, DID does all the paperwork himself to get into magnet high school with the IB program. DID excels in the IB program and gets into the nearby state university (now a top 10 public university) on a variety of scholarships and grants, which he researched and applied for all by himself. Never received any financial help from any family members.  
  
At the University, DID meets eventual wife, who is premed. Travels around the country with her for med school and residency. Works at several advertising firms along the way. After residency, moves to Jacksonville, FL where wife takes job at one of the hospitals and DID founds his own online advertising firm. Now DID makes like $300k/year and his Dr wife makes more and they live in a huge house like 6 blocks from the beach.  
  
That covers the work ethic and up by his bootstraps point. Now the natural intelligence.  
  
DID has 4 siblings. They're all short sighted, immediate gratitude, poor decision making, in their 40s and still working menial jobs BUT as far as I know (known DID since 6th grade) not on drugs or with criminal records (so it isn't like they got into the system early and had additional barriers). The only one who doesn't live in a trailer park near the parents, check to check, is one sister who married her HS boyfriend who eventually became a Ford dealership manager after working there like 20 years and lives a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  
  
Those 5 people grew up in the same home, all born in the USA, none had noticeable accents, and all went to the same schools outside of DID choosing basically on his own to go to the two magnet programs. All of his siblings suffer from dumb people issues like lack of logic and inability to prepare for the future. The only explanation is DID being naturally smarter than his siblings.",1647305935.0,-2

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

>Values have been adjusted for **purchasing power parity** and take into account both the payment of **taxes and social contributions**, and transfers in kind received by households (such **health** or **education** provided for free or at reduced prices by government).

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

Holding every western country to the same, HIGHER standards used in the US makes just about every country not named Norway(1/2 the population size of Los Angeles county) or Luxembourg (~9x smaller than Norway) look worse.

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,7

In 2011, Professor Hsiao, told lawmakers in Vermont that a single payer system would have to be financially supported through a payroll tax.

* He predicted the tax would be 12.5 percent in 2015 and 11.6 percent in 2019, including a 3 percent contribution from employees.

> Professor William Hsiao, A health care economist now retired from Harvard University, Hsiao has been actively engaged in designing health system reforms and universal health insurance programs for many countries, including Taiwan, China, Colombia, Poland, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Sweden, Cyprus, Uganda, and recently for Malaysia and South Africa. In 2012 he was part of Vermont's Healthcare and in 2016 he was part of Bernie's M4A Healthcare Plan

> * Hsiao developed the “control knobs” framework for diagnosing the causes for the successes or failures of national health systems. His analytical framework has shaped how we conceptualize national health systems, and has been used extensively by various nations around the world in health system reforms

Exposure to even moderate ambient lighting during nighttime sleep, compared to sleeping in a dimly lit room, harms your cardiovascular function during sleep and increases your insulin resistance the following morning, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.

“The results from this study demonstrate that just a single night of exposure to moderate room lighting during sleep can impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation, which are risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome,” said senior study author Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician. “It’s important for people to avoid or minimize the amount of light exposure during sleep.”

There is already evidence that light exposure during daytime increases heart rate via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which kicks your heart into high gear and heightens alertness to meet the challenges of the day. 

“Our results indicate that a similar effect is also present when exposure to light occurs during nighttime sleep,” Zee said.

Yes, that is the main way it is regulated.

Transient activation of p53 triggers blockage of the cell cycle, extended activation triggers apoptosis (regulated cell death). So by default it should definitely not be stable and active. You just ideally want it to become stable and active in cancer cells, to stop them dividing and hopefully make them die (though many of them are resistant to apoptosis in other ways).

There does appear to be one evolutionary optimization that we're lacking - elephants have many copies of their p53 gene, so it's much less likely for pre-cancerous cells to lose them.",1647299640.0,1

I found it to be a pretty interesting look into his persona. Just a snippet:

 ""Bob Hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station in Anaheim, providing they have a camera there and three people. He'll go to the opening of a market to receive an award. He'd get an award from Thom McCan for wearing their shoes. It's pathetic. It's a bottomless pit. A barrel that has no floor. He must be a man who has an ever-crumbling estimation of himself. He's constantly filling himself up. He's like a junkie – an applause junkie. What happens to those people when they can't get up and do their shtick, God only knows. Bob Hope, Christ, instead of growing old gracefully or doing something with his money, be helpful, all he does is he has an anniversary with the President looking on. It's sad. He gets on an airplane every two minutes always going someplace. It didn't bother him at all to work the Vietnam War. Oh, he took that in his stride. He did his World War II and Korean War act.

Worked for AOL for a brief time in the late '90s (it was terrible, the company had no ethics at all, but that's not the story here).

However with celebrity accounts, even when they'd get a CAT strike or block, they wouldn't deal with CAT, but could still call the VIP team and get the block or strike removed, basically no questions asked.

He became legendary as Razor Ramon in WWF and continued to be successful in WCW as a founding member of the NWO.

But then after his life started to spiral out of control. He was known for showing up completely wasted an indie shows. Pretty much every wrestling fan considered him a lost cause.

But somehow, with the help of fellow legend Diamond Dallas Page, Hall was able to turn his life around and finally gave us insight into how great of a mind he had for wrestling. I always wished to see his return as a manager or trainer. So sad to see him go; wish he’d been around more but he could’ve left us much earlier.

Bad times don't last, but bad guys do."" 

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279012.0,37

Bad times don't last, but bad guys do."" 

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

How true that last part is, I dunno, but Hall was that kinda guy to the fans so I buy it. He conquered a lot of demons, he shouldn't have to go out like this.",1647279019.0,9

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die.

While I can't speak to your very specific and extremely traumatizing experience, I just wanted to share the perspective that pacifism and the right to defend yourself against the aggression of others are not at all at odds with each other.

I'm not religious myself, but **even Jesus** told people that nobody could be expected to just sit there and take any kind of treatment. He said, ""If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men."" To me, those provisos were his way saying, ""Be nice to people, but if someone comes around looking for a fight, that's on them, not on you.""

And as far as the ""turn the other cheek"" concept, I like this interpretation:

>At the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to be of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and dominance. If the persecuted person ""turned the other cheek,"" the discipliner was faced with a dilemma: The left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was demanding equality.

>Wink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10–13). By giving the lender the cloak as well, the debtor was reduced to nakedness. Wink notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, and not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20–23).

>Wink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions.[3] In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law, as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law.[4]",1647301393.0,3

I saw the clip of him interrupting the roast for Iron Sheik, juxtaposed to an interview with him discussing it sometime after.

Hall looks beaten and he just kind of mumbles, “I have a tendency to do that. I’m a little bit too old to be changing my ways now.” Like he just accepts his addiction and the fallout that inevitably comes.

I'm a bit of a rambler but I'll do my best to keep it concise, but there was a lot going on all at once. 

I had moved in with my then boyfriend of two years (now husband) and our roommate (best friend of husband, close friend of mine). We lived in a 340 sqft studio apartment (yes, that's a really small apartment for three people! It was supposed to be temporary while we looked for a 2 bedroom apartment) in one of those old apartments where they just stacked some studios on top of each other in concrete squares. We lived in the biggest city in the state and studios were the cheapest living, especially split three ways. It was the kind of place where when we heard scratches in the walls, we just assumed rats because well, its a shitty old apartment. 

On February 17th, we were woken up to a knocking sound coming from upstairs, like someone was aggressively putting together IKEA furniture. It woke my boyfriend and I up, and I just covered my head with my pillow. We had heard noises late at night from him so we just always assumed he worked night shift. Well this night, the banging noises didn't stop, and went on throughout the day until 1PM. 

At 8AM, my boyfriend got out of bed, and went to work. Our upstairs neighbor ran down the stairs, chased him into the parking lot and said ""If I ever catch you in my apartment again, I'll fucking kill you!""

Having never BEEN in this man's apartment, my boyfriend was confused, said ""Okay man"" and got in his car and started driving to work. He called me on the way and told me to make sure the deadbolt was locked. I did and told him to call the non emergency line (Note: At this time, we just thought this dude was victim of a break in and thought my boyfriend was part of it, we had no idea what was going on here). So he called them, they said they'd send someone over and to be home by 2 so we could give our statement. 

The roommate and I go about our day, listening to the banging, semi worried, mostly focused on applying for jobs (both of us recently unemployed). I'm more concerned than our roommate, but just waited for the cop to get here. 

Boyfriend comes back at noon, the banging stops at 1PM, at 2PM a cop comes over. She comes in, listens to our side of things (""We dont know this dude"",""weird noises last night"" ""threatened to kill me if i ever went into his apartment, I've never been in there"",etc), and goes up to talk to the neighbor. 

40 minutes go by. We can hear them through the floor, which really should have been a clue that the floor's structural integrity wasn't how it used to be. 

After 40 minutes, she comes back down and knocks on our door. We open the door for her, and she comes back in, turns around and deadbolts the door immediately. I'll never forget how she turned back to us and said ""Holy shit guys, its so much worse than we thought."" because that was the LAST thing I'd ever want a cop to say. I remember I burst out laughing. At the time life had been really rough on me and this just felt like a kick to the nuts. Of course it was worse than we thought. 

So I can't remember everything, there was a lot, but basically she went up there and this guy had FIVE locks on his door, that he himself had installed. He was VERY excited that a cop had ""finally"" come to help him. He claimed several things, but the ones that I can remember were that we had been floating (yes, floating) through the ceiling, whispering to him about how we would ""get"" him, how no one would ever believe him, how they'd never find his body, he claimed we had been sexually assaulting him every night, we've been spying on him and had put cameras in his apartment, he just couldn't find them because they were imperceivably small. How'd we get them in there? Well when we floated in there. Also that we had stolen his watch, his belt and had been drinking the milk from his fridge. 

So that knocking noise we had been hearing, from 3:30AM to about 1PM - well apparently he had decided he had had enough and ripped up all the carpet in the apartment and began digging a hole into his floor/our ceiling, to ""take care of the three punks downstairs"" and if the cops didn't do something about it, ""\[he\] would do what he needed to do, they needed to be stopped"" - based on his threat to my boyfriend, we took this to mean he planned on killing all of us. 

Oh, and what we thought were rats? Yeah turns out that he wanted to counter spy on us and had bought cameras and had been pushing them down the vents to try and spy on us. The  vents were in the bathrooms. I try not to think about it too much cuz the idea that this guy had footage of my 11PM shits and shower snot rockets (and you know, my naked body) is too creepy. The cop said the cameras he got weren't good quality nor were they hooked up to any sort of device that could save all the footage but still.

If you were able to snatch the gun from them, is it not equally likely that they can snatch the gun from you?

An attacker within arms reach is still a threat.

Now, if they turn and run, or throw their hands up and back off, cool. Confrontation over.

If they keep fighting with you, then... you may have to do what it takes to make them unable to harm you.

Problem of course is that there may not be time to wait and see if they throw their hands up.

If someone else is trying to hurt or kill you, and you get a window to take action and stop them, you don't know how quick that window is going to close, sometimes you may need to act while you have the chance to act.

I'm slightly shaking, partially out of terror but mostly from rage. Thankfully the cop is trained in mental health crisis, but this is a doozy even for her. She said the creepiet thing is the man APPEARED sound of mind. If it wasn't for the five locks on the door and  talking about us floating through the floor, he didn't come off like a lunatic. He had a job. He had no record (she checked) of mental health or criminal issues, though he did come from out of state, so we dont really know his background. 

  
So she tells us the game plan. In our state, if she admitted him involuntarily today, they would have to take his accusations seriously. He apparently wanted a rape kit done on him. If they did that, we would be continually exposed to this guy, and the cop could tell we were just knocked out of left field by this. It'd be months or YEARS of this following us around. So instead, she told us she would tell our apartment we needed to break lease and emergency vacate the apartment (the apartment had been notified at this point that this dude had ripped up the carpet and several light fixtures). Due to tennant laws in our state, they couldn't evict him immediately, but she could get us away from him immediately and she knew if we stayed he would eventually attack us. So what we had to do was vacate the apartment and get a restraining order. Because my boyfriend was technically the only one on the lease, he had to go get the restraining order. So he had to leave, and the cop had to leave to go with him and report to the judge.  She said she had called backup, but because this guy hadn't even technically gotten in, we had to wait for some cops to get done with other calls and get to us. The reason this needed to happen this way and with this timeline, was because if we got a restraining order first, and THEN he was admitted after we left the apartment, when they admitted him and he said ""my downstairs neighbors were r\*ping me"" the cop could say ""He doesn't have downstairs neighbors and the ones he did have have a restraining order against him"". It was the best way to protect us from dealing with it for years. But it meant leaving me and my roommate alone in the apartment. 

Before she left with my boyfriend to get the restraining order (This took a total of SIX HOURS because at this point it was 4PM on a Friday and the judge supposed to take care of our district had already left by the time they got to the courthouse. The whole time my boyfriends phone was dying so I had no clue when he'd get back) she asked if we had a gun on hand. We said yes - my boyfriends shotgun. She asked if I or the roommate knew how to use it, I said I did. In fact a month ago I had learned from a friend in the coast guard how to combat load it. She told me to keep it on hand but out of reach from the door. She had lied to the neighbor upstairs and claimed to be taking my boyfriend in for questioning, but had no clue if he would stay in his apartment like ordered. Not that that was safe either as he had already decided tunneling to us was a solution to his problems. 

I knew we were in a bad situation because the cop seemed so upset because she couldn't keep us safe. We were in a hard situation. Everyone involved in this was in a difficult situation, even mr crazypants upstairs. 

So that's how I sat, holding a shotgun in my lap for about six hours, next to my roommate, waiting for the crazy person upstairs to realize a door was much thinner and easier to get through than a floor-ceiling. And realized in that moment that if he came through the door, I was going to pull that trigger. That was honestly more traumatizing than realizing someone wanted to kill me - realizing that I was willing to kill them back. I think about that moment a lot, especially around the anniversary. It makes me feel cold in my soul. It takes something different inside someone to take a life, even in self defense, and you don't know its inside you until you're there. I haven't been able to watch the Life of Pi since, because I know what its like, having that Tiger on the boat (assuming you subscribe to that metaphorical interpretation). It's been five years and I still feel weird about that knowledge of myself now. 

To sum up the ending of a very, very long story, after six hours my boyfriend got the restraining order and the cops escorted us out of the apartment. We had just our backpacks, my medications, and the shotgun. We slept on several friends couches for two weeks while we tried to find a new apartment (and we did, eventually going back for our stuff). The first night I didn't sleep at all, just laid down next to my friends two puppies petting them, listening to my roommate and boyfriend snore. Last I had heard they were admitting mr crazy pants to a psychiatric hospital. That was five years ago and to be honest, I didn't really care to pursue it and just wanted as far away from it as possible.

I've now married said boyfriend and still am great friends with the roommate (who now has a girlfriend himself and god they're so cute together). Hilariously the \*NEXT\* upstairs neighbor (the one that ordered takeout every weekend and scared me haha) ended up being a therapist and helped me find a good one. I'm also god-mom to his dogs and he ended up playing Led Zeplin as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. So not all my neighbors have been bad lol

I just wanted to end by saying, I do not feel hatred towards the neighbor. I mostly feel pity. He thought we were torturing him, and if someone had been floating up and sexually assaulting me, I probably also would want to kill them. However I also do not feel guilt about holding a shotgun ready to shoot him, and I would not have felt guilty about shooting him if I had to. He was the one threatening to kill us after all and I'm sure if he had managed to kill my husband I probably WOULD hate him. I still cannot put into words how I exactly feel about it. My hope is he got help, somehow, and never put anyone else in danger. 

Hope you enjoyed the ride. I keep telling myself I'll put it on youtube but never get around to it lol",1647304309.0,6

Jake Roberts was so defeated by his history of drug abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and industry abuse that he had basically resigned himself to die. DDP took Jake into his home, helped him get and stay off drugs, helped him lose weight, and helped him reach out to the fans to crowd fund surgery to repair the damage to his body which was causing him to keep using pills. 

Jake was so touched by how fast the fans funded his surgeries that he started crying. This whole experience was filmed and his reaction was to cry and say something like ""...after all those years, they never forgot me."" He wound up kicking his habits, surviving his minor relapses, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame shortly after.

* The portuguese royal family supposedly didn't have to flee the country, the french battalion that Napoleon sent to Portugal was weak and tired and couldn't have won the battles even if they wanted.

After 1808, the country started having formal education, universities, books (were forbidden until then), currency, banks, justice system and a Constitution. Contrary to the US, in 1800, only 1% of the brazilian population was able to read.
* The brits were responsible for the voyage, and they noted many interesting things, like the very precarious situation in the portuguese ships, like the rotting wood of the ships, spoiled water, etc.
* In 1808, Rio didn't have currency (they exchanged goods) and the official language was Tupi Guarani (native tribe). Which means, Rio spent 300 years being developed in a semi european semi tribal way.",1647271724.0,10

> In 1808, Rio didn't have currency (they exchanged goods) and the official language was Tupi Guarani (native tribe). Which means, Rio spent 300 years being developed in a semi european semi tribal way.

Just no. First of all, there's no language called ""Tupi-Guarani"". Tupi-Guarani is the term of the branch, Tupi and Guarani being languages that share the same root. Second, we are talking about early 19th century Rio here. Sadly, most native people of the coast fled (or were murdered) centuries before that. 

You could say that São Paulo, in the 17th century, spoke mainly a Pidgin language between Tupi and Portuguese (with Spanish loan words), called Língua Geral Paulista, because São Paulo was an inland settlement, and it was the starting point of many incursions into the country seeking to enslave natives and search for goods (Entradas e Bandeiras). 

But Rio was a totally different thing.

Firstly, it's a costal city, at the time, the second largest city in Brazil, after Ouro Preto. Also, the main port where all the gold extracted in Minas Gerais was shipped to Europe (after the Estrada Real was closed in 1710 and Paraty lost importance). In fact, all that gold attracted lots and lots of Portuguese migrants (I'm a descendant of a few), and made Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro trully Portuguese-speaker places. Don't forget that years before, in 1789, there was a revolt in Ouro Preto against the Portuguese rule, lead by Tiradentes, himself son of a Portuguese settler. In 1763, the Marquis of Pombal transferred the colonial administration from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro.

Also, because it was already the capital for 45 years and all gold was shipped from there, there's no way they didn't had currency in 1808. Again, you could say that to 17th century São Paulo, but not 19th century Rio.

TL,DR: Rio already was a deeply Portuguese settlement. The natives were wiped out from the region way before 1808.",1647293309.0,2

A métrica d'Os Lusíadas exige uma leitura silábica - o que, em linguística chama-se de pronúncia ""syllable-timed"", onde todas as sílabas possuem a mesma duração temporal. O português brasileiro possui essa característica. Já no caso do português europeu, a pronúncia é ""stress-timed"", e as sílabas tônicas possuem duração temporal muito maior que as outras sílabas. Daí a pronúncia cols-TROL europeia, enquanto a brasileira é CO-LES-TE-RÓU (como dizes).

Se declamares a primeira estrofe de Os Lusíadas, verás que o ritmo brasileiro encaixa-se melhor na métrica decassílaba camoniana, enquanto se acaso uses a métrica europeia, verás que o ritmo fica comprometido. E é compreensível, porque o português europeu adquiriu essa forma nos séculos XVIII e XIX, enquanto o brasileiro conservou uma forma mais arcaica de pronúncia, mais próxima da de Camões.

let's take a circle, we are going to make this a BIG circle, for it's radius we will use each and every atom in our universe spaced out the width of the universe. so this is a REALLY big circle. now we somehow have determined this length exactly, so our only error will be in the value of pi. when we calculate the area of the circle, and use 150 digits to do it, our error will be less than the area of an atom.
