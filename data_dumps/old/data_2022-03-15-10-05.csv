One ankle bite from a pit or a German Shepard and that's a wrap on your career, do you think it's reasonable to ask them to take that chance every time, over the thousands of dogs they'll encounter in a career? How long until they're wrong one time and that's it, no 2nd chance. 

They don't just shoot dogs willy nilly they shoot them when they're unleashed and aggressive, and almost always during trying to apprehend someone or get them to come out of a house. Those guys don't want to break a kids heart, but they're not gonna risk their career over it and we can't expect them to. 

I do wish they carried some sort of dart or non lethal specifically for dogs, but as with the taser, these are almost always split second decisions that have to be made. 

Cop pulls the dog dart as the dog runs at them, the suspect takes that opportunity to run at them with a knife and now they're not holding their gun. That's why they don't take the chance.

So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide.

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting - this is not unlike when you get a Check Engine light over something that‚Äôs not related to the engine

458,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,7062,16566,0.93,"I'm fine now, but:

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind‚Äôs rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, ‚ÄúWell, now you‚Äôre just like the rest of us,‚Äù meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke.

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

732,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,7062,16566,0.93,"I had the same thing happen to me. I was diagnosed depressed and put on Cymbalta. About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Didn‚Äôt need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn‚Äôt focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn‚Äôt remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I‚Äôve described seek medical attention.

It‚Äôs been two years almost now since that event and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight. I‚Äôm talking 80 pounds or so. I‚Äôve been through a few other medications and psychiatrists and think I‚Äôve finally found one who understands what the drug interaction did. I don‚Äôt know for sure if Im actually bipolar or if it was the drugs but I have been safely off of medication for months now and feel ok.

GPs should really be under some kind of obligation to keep up to date with advancements in medicine. Obviously they can't be expected to learn *every* new thing, but you'd think if it was important enough to earn a Nobel prize that my doctor would have at least heard of it.

Simmer at medium to med-low while stirring for 15-20 minutes, longer with lower temp (but you MUST keep stirring or the cream will curdle and while it doesn‚Äôt change the taste much the texture is nasty)

I once rented a house that turned me into a total hippie/urban homesteader. This yard was a foragers dream. Random volunteer plants in the summer from previous tenant gardens, blackberries in September, a grape vine, walnuts and sweet chestnuts in October. So I learned how to harvest all of these things and make stuff from them. I wouldn't say what we made from the grapes was *wine* as much as backyard hooch but it was fantastic as a sangria base.

Walnuts were the messiest, I learned that the black stuff you wash off the shell from the husk was used historically to make ink (and is still used as a basis for furniture stain!), but my GOD they were amazing in our Thanksgiving stuffing.

So one day, I went out to get some blackberries for pancakes and I noticed two random leeks growing along the fence.

I walk back inside and one of her friends approached me and told me if I told her, the friend, that I never wanted to see or talk to my ex again she would let me leave. I complied and told her friend that it was over and I never wanted anything to do with my ex again. I waited a few and peeked outside and saw the coast was clear and started heading to my truck. I hear a scream and look over and my ex is running full speed at me screaming. Out of no where another lady does a full on tackle of my ex and says get the fuck out of here. As I drive away I get a call from the party saying she locked herself in the bathroom with a knife threatening to off herself. I called her parents and kept driving.

2) egged new girlfriends car

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off ‚Äújust over a block‚Äù from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober.

Soon after this, she secretly planned to move him into our home, and gave him our wifi password.

We needed his portion of rent, with mine to afford the new apartment. We got into an argument that night and I decided to go home to cool off that night. The next day he was unreachable. It didn‚Äôt bother me too much, I had a full day that day and called him the next day where he sounded fine. Then he waited almost a week, then off- handedly mentioned that he didn‚Äôt call the landlord so he couldn‚Äôt move in with me. He knew I didn‚Äôt have the $ to move into the new apartment now. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt call and give notice that day and he said because you didn‚Äôt seem too worried about it when  you argued with me that night. I broke up with him right then and there. And here‚Äôs the funniest part. He was SHOCKED. Two weeks later I was living on the other side of the state and ignoring his letters.",1647308092.0,418

Yknow, because i was ""nice"". That gave her about three weeks. I went on an impromptu road trip with my buddy about two weeks into it and when I got back, she let me know she had moved out while i was away, so about a week prior.

When I got back to my apartment, every single thing I  owned was piled up, in the center of the living room. This isn't an exaggeration. The apartment looked ready to rent to new tenants, except for the massive pile of furniture, collectibles, clothing, medicine cabinet contents, food from the fridge and pantry and since it was June...fucking MAGGOTS!! It took a week to really sort through. I kept finding more fucked up stuff, like my childhood teddy bear, ripped at his neck, so his head just dangled there, 25 year old stuffing, bleeding out.

She married young and moved away after high school‚Ä¶her husband was a defense contractor so they moved around a lot. We kept in touch by phone and met up about once a year for a mini-vacation. Back in 2019 I was going through a nasty divorce and she invited me to come live with her (with my 14 year old daughter) until the divorce was finalized (ex was unstable at this point).  I get to her home over 1800 miles away and find out that everything she‚Äôs told me for 32 years was a lie‚Ä¶her job, her being married, her living situation‚Ä¶everything. She was a hoarder and about 80% of the house was inaccessible. The parts that were accessible were filthy - she had multiple animals and there was poop everywhere!  On top of that, she was in the process of being evicted and she wanted me to give her $8k to lease a new home‚Ä¶in addition to spending every waking moment cleaning up her hoard. Her two daughters (21 and 19) were still living at home and they began telling me the rest of the story‚Ä¶how she had mountains of debt, how she planned to fleece me to get a new place to live‚Ä¶what‚Äôs worse was what they told me about what they had been through. She had mentally/emotionally/physically abused both of them throughout their childhood - just one example: she had beaten her youngest daughter with a wooden broom handle with such force that the broom handle broke. I asked my ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs‚Äù common law husband to confirm this and he said yes, it had happened TWICE. He also said that she would beat her oldest daughter with a laptop charging cable throughout her childhood and she had severe nerve damage in both legs because of it. I confronted my ex-friend about all of this and told her I was leaving and wasn‚Äôt going to give her a cent. She retaliated by calling the police on me and telling them I was selling opioids and meth - almost got arrested until the cops realized I had no record, no large sums of money, and no drugs. Then she called CPS on me saying I was sexually abusing my daughter‚Ä¶no proof (because I wasn‚Äôt guilty) and both her daughters made statements that their mother lied - didn‚Äôt hurt that ex-friend was known to CPS for abusing her own children. She then called my unstable ex - the one who had threatened to kill me - and told him where I was. It was a shit show. It took me two days to sort everything out and prepared to leave. In that time she called CPS and reported me three more times, and tried to steal my car. She also began calling my elderly/terminally I‚Äôll mother, telling her I was a drug addict/dealer and I‚Äôd been arrested. I won‚Äôt even go into the vile things she texted to my child.

When I was a senior in high school, my friend since I was like 5 got kicked out of her mom's house. Her mom was chaotic and not the best parent so my mom let her live with us without much question. My brother had just moved out so we had a spare room.

My friend lived with us for.. let's say a few months, I can't really remember, and one day I give my debit card to my brother to buy me booze. He texts me and says it's declined. 

That doesn't seem right so I check my account. Sure enough, several ATM withdrawals for a couple hundred bucks over the course of a week or so have been made, and not by me.

So I get home from work and am complaining to my friend that someone stole all my money and I have to file a police report etc. She leaves saying she's going to her grandma's like 10 minutes after this. 

The cop comes, I tell him what happened, he says he'll look into it. I have to file a bunch of paperwork at my bank. It's a pain in the ass. Somehow it comes to be known the withdrawals have all been from the bank my friend uses, and my mom suggests maybe it was her. I totally refute that, saying there's no way my best friend would do that to me. 

The cop calls me and basically says like ""we tracked the withdrawals, watched the ATM footage, found out it's said friend, her dad would like to pay you back in full if you won't press charges."" I say sure.

After paperwork agreeing to these terms is signed, she tries to talk to me and I tell her to leave. Her grandma calls me and pleads me not to kick her out. That ship has sailed grandma.

Anyway she comes back to move her shit out and I sit on the couch watching pawn stars while she struggles to carry and load a box spring by herself. I never found out exactly what happened, I assume she'd just take my debit card while I slept and put it back before I noticed. I'm not sure how she expected not to get caught..",1647318961.0,24

I wasn't home, but she convinced the landlord (who knew us) to let her in. I had told the propery management specifically to NOT let her in. Anyway, I came home and my house was completely empty outside of my dog and an empty fish tank. I'm not exaggerating the empty. She took everything that wasn't nailed down. Food from the fridge, cupboards, pantry, etc. She took the SHOWER CURTAINs. We had two irons, she took both of them. Took my furniture, TVs, game systems plus games. This bitch even took the light bulbs out of the light fixtures. And not just the easy to access ones. The ones that are above those apartment panels everyone knows about.

I called the police and told them I had been robbed. When they got there the landlord said he let her in. Her name is not on the lease. They told me it was a civil matter and they couldn't do anything about it. I was obviously upset and being loud. My ex-army buddy was with me. The cops threatened to bash my head into the wall, called me a mutt (I'm mixed) and then left.

Editing because this comment kinda blew up:

We tried going after the property management. Unfortunately, their excuse was there was nothing in writing and the property management ""didn't recall"" me telling them not to let her in. She had already established domicile unfortunately, so she has the same ""rights"" that I do as a tenant. I would have had to evict her or prove that she somehow posed a threat to my life.

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers. Like finding your wife's secret tinder or then Tumblr account and it's just full of other dudes and confessions. We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

I felt so much guilt. I felt guilt for not knowing my.firsr doctor lied. I felt guilt for not being able to keep her inside longer. I felt guilt I couldn't save her and I felt guilt that it was likely my damaged egg that caused it. I survived the c section. I had physical scars and breasts full of milk waiting to care for a baby that would never come home. I hated myself. 

My husband never once blamed me. He was struggling, too. He was devastated. I couldn't do that to him. I couldn't leave him with all that grief. I kept trying to go on for him. And our cats. They were kittens, just babies, and I was still their mama. They still needed me. I got into therapy. It helped.

When I was at my lowest, I thought things had no potential to get better, which was the most painful thing for me. I even called up the suicide hotline and walked them through the logic of why suicide was the logical option. They didn't have anything to say to me. Thankfully I stuck around because my life is fantastic now. If I could have written a story for my future when I was in my 20's (I'm in my 40's now), it would be about the life I am living.

There is this one girl, i dont remember her face or her name at all, i dont even know id she is still going to that church.
She comes, and she talked to me, she calm me down and pray together with me.

Im not that religious, although i still remember that moment.
Its not a big thing, she just calm down a kid, and in a way that she know and i know at the time, praying.
She isnt an adult either, i remember her being teen-like, maybe around 14-16 years old.

I dont think that person realize how much she effect my life.
We dont know when or whos life we can effect, and im sure most of the time we have no idea we did just that, over very small things. Like simply smiling to strangers, or go ask your old friend whats up.

If trying to live another day gave me just a small chance for me to do just that for someone else, im gonna try to hold into that, so maybe i can somehow lessen someone else's struggle, even when no one notice it, including me and them.

When I was completely alone at the house I went for the gun and sat down, thinking about it. In my mind at the moment, I couldn't find any reason not to do it, so I pulled the trigger. 

For a brief moment I wasn't sure if I had died or what was happening. I just awoke and checked the gun and saw it wasn't loaded. After crying for what felt like days, I decided to try again the next day.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal. But while I was eating, a girl from my class randomly started making conversation with me and sat down. Briefly after she asked for a cookie. I was a little annoyed but I just couldn't say no. 

A couple minutes passed and her mom picked her up. She stood up, turned around and told me ""See you tomorrow"".

I came back home and waited until I was alone again and went for the gun. This time I was way more calmed and all I could think of was that ""See you tomorrow"".

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren‚Äôt appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don‚Äôt we spend more time with them, why don‚Äôt we go out more, why don‚Äôt we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don‚Äôt do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven‚Äôt done it yet, I probably won‚Äôt ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live. With each revolution, from guilt to guilt, it feels less and less hopeful each time. And at the end of every distance stage, you feel more and more alone.",1647280936.0,77

If I had known that was the last time I'd see her alive, I would've stayed longer. Just a little bit longer to give her another kiss.

My ex died last August from a drug overdose in the woods. Well honestly in an empty lot next to a construction site. It was egregious and terrible and brutal for him, and not the way any human being should be photographed by police or remembered by their parents. 

Was it a drug overdose as suicide? Was it a garden variety drug overdose? I think there's a 90% chance it was overdose as suicide, his mother doesn't feel that and I would never try to change her mind. 

Regardless of the method though, even if it had been some magical peaceful method (and you know it's a cruel joke that mother nature makes damn sure it's impossible to kill ourselves peacefully) it wasn't about the photographs or what his mother had to see. 

It was the fact her child was taken from her. Adult child but still her son. The people we are put here in the world to love beyond all reason and protect and guide into the future beyond us. It breaks a person. 

She thinks about him everyday. She hurts everyday. I check in on her occasionally and we touch base. There's not going to be a day that goes by in her life that she doesn't think of her dead son. And there have been a very few days between August and today that I haven't thought about him.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1159

Produced by the BBC and RDF TV in 2002, truer than ever. And no, it's not a flat-earth baseless conspiracy theory, but rather an interesting take on how we got to where we are through public relations and mass psychology. From Wikipedia:

> ""Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed our perception of the mind and its workings. The documentary explores the various ways that governments and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew Edward Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in public relations, are discussed in part one. His daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in part two. Wilhelm Reich, an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but if you were too young to grasp how terrible the storm and its aftermath was, I highly recommend you watch the whole thing. 

The video footage of the floating corpses is haunting. And the documentary offers the important context that the suffering did not end following the storms dissipation. People were stranded, without clean water, without food, medical care or electricity, for /weeks/. And then, they struggled to get the help they needed to rebuild their lives for years, being screwed by the system at every juncture.

What the film got right: 

Overfishing is happening. Serious human rights abuses. Specific kinds of aquaculture has led to environmental impacts. Unsustainable fishing is subsidized by public money. A large volume of gear is discarded , adding to plastic pollution. 

What did it get wrong?

Film misleads viewers on the status and magnitude of all the above concerns. Fish 
stocks are not going to collapse by 2048 (the source it uses is a 1996 paper that has been criticized and acknowledged to be a poor study even by its own authors!) 

Discarded fishing gear is a small component of plastic pollution. 
80% of plastic in the oceans comes from what we throw away on land (soda bottles, food packaging), 20% from marine sources (which is a problem, yes)

Its solution (to boycott/not eat fish) completely ignores the fact that fish and fishing play a critical role in the food security and livelihoods of millions of people around the world. 

Seafood is not full of ‚Äúpollutants‚Äù. Such absolute statements are misleading. 

The Marine Stewardship Council does not receive direct payment from the fisheries certified against its standard. 

Aquaculture is not just shrimp and salmon. 

The solution proposed (‚Äògo vegan‚Äô) is a VERY privileged position and cannot be adopted by everyone in the world.

Related  fun fact: the film was partly bankrolled by Leonardo DiCaprio, a 
very vocal (rich white dude) vegan",1647320336.0,7

Wich means, that as game developpement progress and as resolution increase, we could maybe see more and more scopes realistically rendered in fps.

As an exemple, a 4k game could theoretically render a scope with a x2 magnification in HD without any performance loss, as long as you don't consider objects and textures that only appear within a specific range.

Moreover I also have a technical question for the devs out there : if you decide to render a second scene for the scope, does it typically don't add any load on the gpu, since it also stops rendering a similar area on the ""main"" image ?",1647347952.0,3

* It had the worst maps of any cod game to date. Far too big. The one remedy for large maps is ground war yet that wasn't released on the old gen consoles which most people had at the time. 

* One of BO2's best features was the introduction of League Play, a massively popular gamemode. It took IW a couple of months to put in a worse version of it into their game. 
 
* The sniping as mentioned in this thread - awful. 

* Then the worst one, removing SnD?? I understand they added it in after a month or so but that was too late. You can't just remove one of your top 3 most popular and iconic gamemodes.

It‚Äôs from a smaller studio so it doesn‚Äôt have the graphical polish or menu crispness of a COD.  But, it‚Äôs one level more realistic than COD and Battlefield, and I‚Äôm in love.  

It‚Äôs a little slower, one or two bullets kill, no future sci fi gadgets, can‚Äôt shoot whilst going prone or jumping, etc.  it‚Äôs all about strategy and long term communication.  

I‚Äôm not going to sit here and pretend that every game is full of team communicators.  But, everything in this regard is better than COD.  If you create what you want - communication, teamwork, call outs - you‚Äôll get it here in return more than any other FPS I‚Äôve played.

Edit: referring to Insurgency Sandstorm, the game in the original post.  I play on PS5 and from the games subs I hear the player base is a little better here than on PC.  Maybe because it‚Äôs only six months old here.

Older games typically had fairly basic lighting processes, that would light in-game objects on the spot, as they were being rendered. It was trivial to generate reflections back then, because you could afford to re-render each object along the reflection plane (the location and angle that objects are reflected at), due to how basic the lighting processes were.

Nowadays, we have far more complex lighting processes that take place well after in-game objects are rendered, across many passes. We have one pass done at half resolution to compute the ambient occlusion across the entire screen, another half resolution pass to compute an approximation of global illumination, a third full resolution pass to compute shadowing, then a fourth to combine everything and light every object on screen in one go.

Because of this, generating reflections isn't as easy as it was back then. You'd essentially need to repeat this same process again, except on the reflected geometry, potentially many times over for each reflection plane you desire. This would obviously cripple performance, so alternative methods had to be devised, and the most common is screen-space reflections.

Screen-space reflections reuse what's already been rendered to the screen, to avoid having to repeat all lighting processes. This makes generating reflections quite fast, but comes with the downside that only the things that have been rendered to the screen can be reflected, and the moment they go off screen, they stop being reflected.

Because of this, screen-space reflections need another method to fall back onto, and that's typically some form of cubemap or environment probes. Put simply, these are 360 degree renders of the game world at different locations, that have similar lighting processes to old games (to make generating them nice and quick). When screen-space reflections fail, they can instead fall back to either of these, and while they both aren't as accurate, they are convincing enough during gameplay.

Now with hardware-accelerated raytracing (ie RTX), there's a new alternative (or even fall back method) to screen-space reflections, that use a similar principle to older reflections, except they support an infinite number of reflection planes while maintaining a fixed performance cost.",1647348612.0,2

These people are the opposite of Robin Hood. Make it unaffordable for the poor, or even more expensive for them, all so they can enrich themselves. They're driven by greed.

This is the whole reason Monopolies are illegal, and why there's anti-trust laws. Creating artificial scarcity to extort money from people is unethical.

‚ÄúTenga‚Äù is the wrong form of ‚Äútener‚Äù to use in this case. Guy in the video said it twice, knew it didn‚Äôt sound right, and corrected himself the third time.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying ‚Äútengas‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you‚Äôre misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. ‚Äú¬øNo tengas?‚Äù is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are ‚Äúno tengas miedo‚Äù (don‚Äôt be afraid), ‚Äúespero que tengas dinero‚Äù (I expect that you‚Äôll have money), and ‚Äúojal√° que tengas mam√°‚Äù (I hope you have a mom).

Take a look at these resources for more information:

- https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/30848613/Tengas-vs-Tienes",1647362084.0,3
4185,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,570,34648,0.97,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mam√°"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mam√°?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -„Äã ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mam√°) es triste"" -„Äã ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mam√°"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,3

But then he says ""Donde Tu Mama"" which should be ""Donde esta Tu Mama"", the way he said it would sound like ""Where you Mom"" in english. Thirdly the way he pronounces Mama is clearly his english accent as there would be a different inflection on both syllables in Spanish. Then he seems to struggle at the end when he says ""No Tiengas... No Tengas... No Tienes?"" He's mixing up the conjugation on the verb 'tener' which is to Have. ""No Tienes"" is not technically wrong but He should  have said ""No Tenes?"" In this instance due to familiarity with the Deer.",1647361757.0,1
4210,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,570,34648,0.97,"The thing is that Spanish has verb conjugations that alter the spelling of the word in slight ways according to who speaks, what is the subject, the time frame, etc., and in doing so the meaning of a phrase can change or become incoherent.

For example, compare [have](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EnVerbs.aspx?v=have) and [tener](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EsVerbs.aspx?v=tener).

The correct way to say ""you don't have a mom?"" is ""[t√∫] no tienes [mam√°]?"" (square brackets for words that can be omitted). This is indicative present second person (you).

""[t√∫] no tengas [mam√°]?"" doesn't make any sense because it's in the subjunctive mood, present, second person (you). Subjunctive is hard to explain, but it's a more ""what-ify"" way of talking. (I'm clearly ass at grammar theory.)

I remember when Fiona Apple's ""Shameika"" won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance, and people were up in arms about it not really being Rock.  I really like the song.  I still have no idea whether it's really Rock or not.  But every 10 years or so, a totally new music emerges and becomes part of ""Rock and Roll"".  If your definition of Rock and Roll is Chuck Berry, you might be surprised by the Beatles ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", even though they were big fans of Chuck Berry.  If your definition of Rock and Roll is the Beatles, you might be surprised by funk emerging in the 70s.  (Actually I remember this discussion coming up separately on reddit once, of whether or not funk is rock.  To me it is, at least...)  If your definition is funk, you'll be surprised by New Wave.  If your definition is New Wave, you'll be surprised by grunge.

If I were to try to define Rock and Roll, maybe some of the key features are that it is loud and features guitars, but neither of these things are actually essential.

I've never been starstruck, and I don't conflate celebrities with characters they've written about or played in songs or movies, etc.  It's a job.

I was in the production office at Butler Square, across from the Target Center arena, for the 1994 Earth Day concert in Minneapolis, and getting ready to go up the elevator.  Behind me were a couple of girls... When the elevator doors opened, it was Steve and it turns out the two girls were his nieces who drove over from Wisconsin (where he was born).

He basically came across exactly like any typical uncle talks to their nieces and nephews... not a rock star.  Just a sort of ""hey that's our uncle and he's in this band"" kind of guy.  Very folksy, laid back, middle America kind of guy.

I think Lennon summed it up best:

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyonc√© with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded.

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn‚Äôt listen or watch the video because of ‚Äúsatan‚Äù. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church ‚Äúdances‚Äô.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20‚Äôs at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that‚Äôs come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn‚Äôt miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ‚Äôs life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That‚Äôs fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you‚Äôll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince‚Äôs unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It‚Äôs like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn‚Äôt exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don‚Äôt really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

The technical internet as we know it may have started in 1983, but it was nothing like it was between 1994 - 1996.

It was ALLL dialup, no one could afford a Digital Subscriber Line, and the load time for BBS was crazy. The invention of better, inexpensive IBM clone hardware combined with improved GUIs and browsers changed everything, and that was the mid-90s. I assure you no one was getting their music info from online but the top 1% of the 1%.

The bulk of cultural impact was measured in TV ratings, *pulp magazine sales,* newspapers sold, and radio airtime.

Subsequently, the memorabilia, including the jockstrap, were **donated to the last operating Alaskan Blockbuster Video store in Anchorage**.[4][10] The jockstrap remained there in a glass case along with other items from the Crowe auction and became a local attraction.[10] However, the items failed to prevent the store from closing in July 2018.[11] Afterwards, the owners of the Alaska store **sent all their memorabilia to** the last remaining Blockbuster Video store in the United States, located in **Bend, Oregon**.[12] However, **Crowe's jockstrap was missing** from the items sent to this store, with Oliver claiming in September 2018 that he **did not know its location**.""

Legend of Dragoon is a fond one, Parasite Eve was scary for me. 

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

5862,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,682,16933,0.94,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

I'm appalled at the effects of Russian money in our elections and political campaigns. Sadly, we can't call the police to do anything about it now, we don't have that option.

Did Deripaska use the normal process for removing a squatter?

> The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

> After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

> * leave your property within 24 hours  
> * stay away from your property for 12 months

> To get final possession of the property, you must make a claim for possession.

No, they broke the door open and arrested them for trespass. So, actually, I'm more appalled that Russian Oligarchs who are sanctioned get more favourable treatment than British home-owners, who have to get a court IPO to have squatters removed.

So then Reddit is happy when refugees take the property of the rich? Most Americans are considered exorbitantly rich compared to the average citizen of India or Honduras. If your best friend had a vacation house in Greece, would you rejoice if Greek activists broke into it to house Syrian refugees, and the police seemed to be supporting them, and that it is justified because your friend is considered rich and it's his government's fault there is war?

If you say, ""This guy is rich so he can handle it,"" you could probably handle it if someone stole $100 from you, but how would you feel if they did?

What I see is that the happiness in the comments is either racist ""fuck this guy who is Russian because the government ruling the location he lives did something bad"" or (more likely I think) hypocritical jealousy ""fuck this guy who has more than I do.""

The report also states that Manafort was sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, though investigators couldn't determine why. The report outlines Kilimnik in contact with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, trying to resolve an issue involving Manafort owing a debt to Deripaska. The report goes on to state that the Russian oligarch wanted Manafort to advance Deripaska's interests in the event that Trump won the election. It should also be noted that following the election President Trump dropped sanctions on certain companies that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska's bottom line, though no direct link was established in the Mueller Report.**


*Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[1]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)*


>The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort **[redacted]** did not see a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

>...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, **[redacted].** Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 

>Gate's account about polling data is consistent **[redacted]** with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, **[redacted].**

>The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:

>> *I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.*

>> *Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]*

>Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.

**Furthermore, after being elected the Trump administration removed sanctions from Russian entities that greatly benefited Oleg Deripaska.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)**

>The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows.

>...The document identifies the foundation as Volnoe Delo, which was founded and funded by Mr. Deripaska. It supports programs ranging from¬†stray dog rescue¬†to archaeological excavations to book fairs. Under the deal, it will receive nearly 21 million shares of EN+, amounting to 3.22 percent of the company.

>The confidential document reveals that Glencore, which is among Rusal‚Äôs biggest customers for aluminum, will receive 67.4 million shares of EN+, good for 10.55 percent of the company.

>And VTB, which reportedly already owned nearly 10 percent of EN+, will receive nearly 92 million additional shares, bringing its total stake in the company to about 24 percent.

>In return for the additional shares going to VTB, which were worth nearly $800 million at the close of trading Friday on the Moscow stock exchange, Mr. Deripaska would be released from debts he owes the bank, the document shows. Mr. Deripaska had secured the loans with stock in one of his companies before the sanctions were announced. The stock prices of Rusal and EN+ plummeted after the sanctions were announced last year, but rose on the news of the deal to lift them ‚Äî in effect allowing Mr. Deripaska to pay off more of the loans than he would have been able to do absent a deal with the administration.

>Notably, VTB would be able to collect dividends from its EN+ shares, according to the confidential document, despite the bank being under limited United States sanctions.

>...The document specifies the precise ownership stakes in EN+ of other people and entities with personal relationships to Mr. Deripaska. That includes shares owned by his ex-wife, Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff to Boris N. Yeltsin, a former president of Russia. She owns 5.19 percent of EN+, while her father, Valentin Yumashev, owns 1.57 percent, and a firm called Orandy Capital Limited, which reportedly has links to the family, owns another 1.78 percent, according to the document.

>Taken together, Mr. Deripaska, his foundation, his ex-wife, her father and Orandy Capital would own nearly 57 percent of EN+ under the deal.

>...Critics of the deal pointed out that, after Treasury announced it, the share prices of Rusal and EN+ rose sharply, providing a boost to the portfolios of Mr. Deripaska, his family and VTB.

>‚ÄúScore that a win for Putin,‚Äù¬†tweeted¬†Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, referring to the Rusal share price surge.

You can only apply for an IPO if it‚Äôs been 28 days or less since you found out your property‚Äôs been squatted.

>Fill in an application for an IPO and send it to your local county court.

>The court will send you confirmation of your IPO within a few days. They will also send you documents that you must give to the squatters within 48 hours.

>After being served with an IPO squatters can be sent to prison if they do not:

>leave your property within 24 hours
stay away from your property for 12 months

And then you get vaccines, which don't really cure diseases but rather prevent them. Which makes seeing that they help far less self-evident.

Except does that make any sense at all? Why on earth would Ukraine **want** to draw Belarus into attacking them? Ukraine isn't on the offensive here, they're fighting a purely defensive war, the **last** thing they want is to draw in a new attacker while also jeopardizing their global good will by committing an act of aggression. If they HAD long range missile capable of an attack like that, what possible reason would Ukraine have for launching them at Belarus, and not Russia, or the occupying Russian forces?

It does, however, make sense for *Russia* to have secretly fired that missile, especially if done from Ukrainian territory.

> Alexander Lukashenko, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, says that the country has been hit by a Point-U missile, but says he is &quot;Not going to&quot; take part in the war and has &quot;Not been asked to join it&quot;.

> As a confirmation, just two days ago at night another Point-U missile was launched at the territory of our Belarus, which we together with Russians successfully intercepted and destroyed over Pripyat.

> The Ukrainian air defence system shot down a missile fired from the territory of Belarus in Kyiv.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

When the rose slowly bloomed in the studio splash screen, I let out a hefty chuckle because it seemed so retro and campy at the same time. I heard sneers from 2 rows behind us. My girlfriend was embarrassed after about 20 minutes when I was laughing so hard I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath. The movie audience of about 35 was completely silent but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn‚Äôt be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie. Sometimes I think my laughter just became so infectious because it was so cathartic and uproariously uncontainable. The movie would not be denied, I hadn‚Äôt laughed that hard for eons and when ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to‚Äù, that made it even funnier and more taboo - and even funnier.

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

It's so stupidly gory, and ridiculously funny, even in the final moments of its epic climax (spoiler: >!he fights a giant Kandarian demon in a tank and kills it by duct-taping the Kandarian dagger to the front of a tank shell and fires right into the demon's face, and the scene is exactly as funny as it sounds, complete with slapstick stupidity in a fucking tank!<).

Excited to rewatch the og series and remake as well. Personally, I love the extremely dark, violent, self-serious remake. Too bad we didn't get an Evil Dead 2 that kept the violence and gore and inserted the funny like Evil Dead II.

He was however, allowed to make a sequel. He elected to go ahead and film Evil Dead II as a remake and then tack 10 minutes of exposition on at the beginning to technically make it a sequel - so your method is pretty spot on for how it was intended to be watched.

Those ten minutes are the part he compromised to get it greenlit, everything else was all him. 

People tend to talk down Evil Dead but I think both are excellent, just different vibes.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90‚Äôs.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

Yeah, that's precisely my problem. The Marvel universe has a good number of geniuses, and apparently any of them can make something that competes with Peter's most iconic power. So why don't all the heroes have a smaller version? Clint can have web arrows, Steve can have a tether to his shield, and all of them can just toss out a little net to trip up enemies. Even if they aren't coordinated enough to swing, all of them would benefit from an easy to make net device. And we know it's easy to make, since Peter can do it out of a dumpster!

It also raises the problem of Peter's most iconic conflict -- he's poor as shit. But since these amazing webs can be made from common materials and it's just a matter of application, Peter can just patent a sticky net grenade or whatever and sell them as a nonlethal immobilizing tool to immediately solve his money problems forever. Think a can of silly string with more stopping power than bear mace, he'd make gangbusters.

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.

If you're expecting politicians to be good sources of information on matters of vaccine science, I can't help you there.

Edit: It's also worth pointing out that these vaccines *were* very effective against the original COVID strain and even against Delta so someone talking up the vaccine's capabilities and effectiveness certainly wasn't wrong back then. In the time since then, though, Omicron happened and now some dishonest debaters are holding those words against them even though they were said well before Omicron was even a concern.

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,2

No wonder so many millennial men hate women and can‚Äôt figure out how to date them, when their formative teenage years was filled with this trash or anime. Neither of which are particularly great at displaying that women are humans.

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape.

Over the years, seeing my friends relationships and the issues they face, seeing innumerable horrifying stories about relationships here on reddit, and expanding my hobbies and learning to use my time, it became less a cope and more a happy comfort.  Theres a lot of benefits to being single that people don't talk a lot about.  I can decide to drive 10 hours to see friends and family for a week long vacation with basically no planning or notice (my job is also pretty lax about that stuff, thankfully).  When I get food and have leftovers, they will stay in my fridge till I eat them.  I always know where everything is in my apartment cause its always where I left it.  A few years ago, my job moved several hours away.  The people with families or SOs had to talk about the move and weigh their options with their partners.  I decided to go, and had nothing to hold me back.

I'm sure theres benefits I'm not even thinking about cause I haven't ever lived with a partner (I have had roomates though).

Its not something I'd recommend for everyone.  A lot of people would probably go mad living how I live.  Some folks just need people around to be happy, and that makes sense, we're a social species.

In an era in which action against collective entities was discouraged among the general populace (e.g. a few hundred years ago), but action against individuals was encouraged (e.g. physical fights and duelings seen as legal), this might reverse.

Heck, it might even reverse in the USA less then 100 years ago when lynchings were de facto legal and unionization efforts scorned as communistic or otherwise un-American.

A good point brought up below was social media, which could be a societal reversion to a more balanced ability to act against both collective entities and individuals. OTOH social media also makes it easier for others to act against you, which might create a counter-balance away from individual enmity, as being hostile to an individual psychologically increases the thought that people will be hostile towards you.

Lots of stuff is wrong in Canada, for lots of reasons. Can we really not acknowledge that we‚Äôre not always right? Must every political conversation result in a purity test? Is it possible that good public policy is a moving target?

The issue is ideological rigidity. A complete lack of will to even entertain alternatives.

On one side is truckers who refuse to acknowledge their protest did attract neo-Nazis, confederates, conspiracy nuts, and other anti-democratic assholes.

On the other is a government that refuses to acknowledge the distrust, whether founded in reality or not, that comes from a seemingly inconsistent and arbitrary Corona response.

Only by accepting that we are sometimes wrong and being willing to change course can we actually improve. Acting as if we have the answer and everyone else is wrong leads nowhere.

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food. These story tropes prime viewers to reject healthy foods and prepare them for the fast food and TV dinner ads during the breaks.",1647304253.0,2

The only recording of him saying ""temporarily embarrassed capitalist"" is him criticizing American Communists for being too wealthy. Here's the quote. 

>Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property. ""I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew‚Äîat least they claimed to be Communists‚Äîcouldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.""

EDIT:

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

Hard work paying off is literally just RNG. My parents worked hard, my relatives, my peers‚Äô parents? All hard workers. Who was the only one who made it out of poverty? My parents. 

They didn‚Äôt work harder than my uncles though. I doubt they worked harder than my friends in college or their parents. 

I had class privilege growing up so I was ignorant for a while but in college I got to meet a lot more people and finally started listening to them. 

Being poor is expensive. 

If you start with 3 apples and you‚Äôre consistently spending those 3 apples and also bringing in 3 apples, how is it possible for there to be upward mobility? 
And say they cut expenses. Okay cool. But it reaches a point where you really cannot cut down any more. Now you got 1 apple to spare. 

And this is when ‚Äúlife happens‚Äù tend to happen. If you own a car, something broke down. An emergency came up. You need new shoes for work cuz your current one is falling apart. Everything you saved up just got wiped.

Not only that, but the shoe example: They can‚Äôt splurge on better quality shoes either cuz they can only afford the cheapest ones. And guess what happens? It gets ruined in the future and it repeats. You‚Äôre cycling through the same amount of apples no matter what you do. 

As i said there‚Äôs only so much you can cut in an effort to save without sacrificing other aspects like your mental health. And even when saving, there are a whole bucket of obstacles that ppl don‚Äôt consider: time. 

If you‚Äôre born into poverty, chances are, you live further from your work than someone who lives closer to where most work would be. If you live in the suburbs you NEED a car. But regardless if you drive or bus, chances are you are working with a much smaller time frame to do things in your life than the person living in the more expensive place. 

Nothing I said implies that climbing out of poverty isn‚Äôt possible. It‚Äôs definitely possible. My parents are perfect examples. But with the given information and just looking around, I HIGHLY doubt my parents somehow worked 10x harder than my other relatives or my peers. 

You need hard work AND luck to move up.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

I suspect the data might not be so supportive of their preferred conclusions if other countries were included - especially since the differences identified in the article amount to only a few percentage points even when comparing to their carefully cherry-picked northern European nations.",1647305170.0,82

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely. The fact that so many people see it as proof that they too can make it despite the overwhelming odds seems to me to be connected to other issues related to a lack of perspective, introspection or critical thinking skills.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

Well be glad socialism never took in the US. But I feel most Americans conflate ""social policies"" to ""socialism"".

So you end up with Americans - both from the right and the left of the political spectrum - thinking that socialism is ""free"" healthcare and education.

The left will talk about wanting socialism and at times will praise self-proclaimed socialist/communist countries (dictatorships) and promote their propaganda (Cuba, Venezuela, etc) and the right will talk about how they don't want to end up with socialism ""like Cuba or Venezuela, etc"".

The Nordic Model is not equal to socialism and hasn't made those countries socialist in Europe.

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group. It is very possible to ""get unlucky"" - think 6 figure student loan to attend Harvard law School followed by a massive head injury and being unemployable. This kind of thing happens but it's quite literally extraordinary. Literally out of the ordinary.

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

Most of the people screaming ""Europeans have a stronger middle class"" base it on inequality measures and not as much on income thresholds. Holding every western country to the same, HIGHER standards used in the US makes just about every country not named Norway(1/2 the population size of Los Angeles county) or Luxembourg (~9x smaller than Norway) look worse. You can also compare those tiny countries to US states that are relatively rich (e.g. Massachusetts and Maryland).",1647299787.0,34

Making less makes it harder to see the benefits of financial literacy, but it does not make the entire discipline irrelevant. If anything, it makes financial literacy a far more important topic - because the stakes are dire.

It is expensive to be poor. That is very true, especially in our disposable society. The cheapest thing now is often more expensive tomorrow.

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

Maybe upper-working class/lower-middle class (depending on if you consider working class to exist in between middle and lower classes).

I find the classical definition of upper, middle, and lower/working class to be meaningless. I think that the classes should fit the following definitions:


**Upper class** - Family income is in excess of 700k, usually in the millions per year with passive income. Easily pays all bills and can eat incredibly expensive meals every single day if they wished. Passive income is far greater than earned income and they can maintain their lifestyle while having more assets than debts with just their passive income. Most purchases, including houses and boats, would make minimal impact on their wealth. Can survive any but the worst financial crises and pay any expense. Can retire at any moment they wish. 


**Middle class** - Family income ranges from 100k to 700k +. Easily pays all bills and can eat expensive meals often. More assets than debts, likely has passive income but it does not exceed their salary or they couldn't maintain their lifestyle without their salary. Many large purchases would make minimal impact on their wealth, larger purchases like houses and expensive vehicles must be loaned/mortgaged. Can usually survive most financial crises and can easily pay most major expenses. Able to retire comfortably and live off their passive income without eating the principle.


**Working class** - Family income ranges from above poverty level to comfortable 100k-200k range. Can pay all bills and eat comfortably, barring large unexpected expenses. More debts than assets until retirement age (and sometimes not even then), their only passive income is typically from their 401k and is not enough to live on without eating into the principle. Most large purchases would need to be budgeted and planned for, larger purchases like houses and vehicles must be loaned/mortgaged. Can be financially ruined by financial crises such as a medical disaster, destroyed home, etc, but the upper levels of working class usually have enough savings to pay for most major unexpected expenses without going into debt. Can retire relatively comfortably.


**Lower class** - Family income at or below poverty level (specific to the area they live in). Often have to choose what bills they can pay and what bills they have to pay late. Eating a full and healthy meal is often beyond what they can afford, let alone going out. Almost no assets at all, and usually a large amount of debt. Any purchase at all must be budgeted and planned for, and often requires going into debt or having help to purchase. Cant obtain a mortgage without the aid of a government program, probably can't get a car loan either. Any unexpected expense will often put them in debt or even ruin them financially. Likely won't be able to retire without family assistance.


The key differentiator between middle class and working class is that the working class dont own their own business, real estate, or other form of significant passive income, and often don't have more assets than their debts.",1647352239.0,2

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems?

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,8

Germans work an average of 1,353.89. Germany is the lowest country on the list. 

On an hourly basis, outcomes are similar but Americans work more compared to Germans. The difference works out to around 7.75 hours a week.

The process is called 'priming.' People are more likely to pick something they feel they are familiar with even if they don't remember how or why they became familiar with it in the first place. It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high. Information for whatever reason tends to lose context in memory and all that's left after a while is just the impression. It doesn't matter much where that impression came from.

This is just blatantly wrong. Getting into college in Denmark is easy. There's no mighty admission exam keeping the Danish population down. You can enrol and start University any time without a problem. You took a barely related statistics and made up something out of thin air to attribute it?

The reason for this difference is that there are far more upward prospects that don't require you to do a college degree. Well paying trades, certifications, and ""community colleges"" are far more encouraged and successful outcomes for people. This means people aren't funnelled through college educations like in the US where you're fucked if you don't go to college and half-fucked if you do.

 screens prior to its premiere. Fox was promoting the hell out of Brisco  
 County. 

 It's first Friday night was a 2-hour episode, the next Friday   
night, there was a ""UFO special"" on Fox after Brisco County, the third   
Friday night, Sept. 10, 1993, The X-Files started its run.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

  
 I used to work at a graphic arts company and our shift was 2p-10p m-f.    
Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick   
took over and our interest started to wane.",1647359676.0,4

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

This meant the WP's air defense doctrine ended up much more reliant on ground based systems to fill the gap in air power, with a much more extensive proliferation of SAMs and SPAAGs of various specializations in ground units as compared to NATO. These doctrinal differences meant that in a theoretical conflict, NATO would be facing a much more extensive SAM net than WP forces, which necessitated the Wild Weasel role. 

Additionally, the Soviet's SEAD doctine preferred use of standoff weapons and longer ranged jamming to target strategic, high-value targets such as EW radars and especially AWACS. According to what I've read, even smaller SAM systems such as Roland would be ignored by doctrine and left to be engaged by ground units, with the Soviets relying on strategic positioning knowledge and heavy barrage jamming to avoid fire. 

All of this means they're optimized to take out fixed and high-value targets of a relatively limited number and poorly optimized to take out the lower tiers of an air defense network such as MANPADS and short range SAMs, making problems establishing complete air dominance in Ukraine much worse for them in particular.

My favorite use of your version of this tactic is in operation desert storm, by BG Larry Henry (call sign Poobah).

He flew un-manned drones towards these sites, and the Iraqis, thinking they were American f-15s and 16s, turned on their radars and fired.

They even triumphantly reported kills!

Meanwhile the AGM-88 HARMs were already en-route.

At least some of the torpedo bombers had air cover. The problem was that the technique the USN was using at the time sucked.  
Some examples:   
The Enterprises fighter squadron VF-6 was providing cover for Hornets torpedo squadron VT-8 (VF-6 had lost the group of planes it was intended to cover and had basically 'latched' onto VF-8 instead). The issue was that the USN plan was to fly ""high cover"", so the USN fighters were high and the bombers were low, and as a result the USN fighters didn't do much (anything?) to interfere with the Zeros.  
When Enterprises torpedo squadron came in while VF-6 was still in the air and still ineffective.  
Yorktown's strike actually came in together, with the fighters (VF-3), bombers (VB-3) and torpedo aircraft (VT-3) arriving together. They went in as a single strike but one of the ways Japan had of dealing with their CAP being drawn away was keeping 'ready' aircraft on the decks which could be launched to respond to new threats, so by the time they came in the USN fighters were massively overmatched in number (6 USN fighters vs 40+ IJN fighters). VT-3 was also screwed in that they ran headfirst into the fighters chasing down the departing survivors of VT-6. 
  
> The Devastators drew the carrier's Zero cover downwards and they didn't have time to regain altitude when the other bombers arrived.  
  
VT-6 was also the only squadron that really had any effect at drawing the cover downwards, as they actually went in with other attacks. The other torpedo attacks were so early that there was plenty of time for the Japanese CAP to return to altitude. The idea of VT-8 (or VT-6) bravely sacrificing themselves to draw the CAP down is a myth that was created to try and pin a purpose to the slaughter of the torpedo squadron.",1647360789.0,1

My understanding is that they routinely have only a single day of operational training per week. That is simply not enough to compete with NATO's level of training and barely enough to keep their pilots proficient. NATO is a defensive operation not offensive so, without fighter aircraft to dominate the skies, the Russians really have no chance to do what the Soviets very well may have done 50 years ago with regard to a full-on attack. That technology gap coupled with a lack of training in fighter aircraft has just become too wide. There is also the matter of geographic position. 50 years ago, the Soviets were right on the doorstep of what was then Western Germany. Today they would have an additional 1300 plus KM to cover before reaching the same location with their tanks. There is absolutely no chance they would make it that distance without being almost completely destroyed in the process. Russia is completely surrounded by NATO forces on all sides of their Western borders with the only exception being Ukraine and Moldova.

While I agree the initial rocket flare is enough to catch the eye of an aviator if said aviator is looking directly at the area from which the MANPAD was fired. In actuality the aviator is going to be focused not only on potential MANPAD usage but  also delivering the bomb payload to the potential target. The reason why you see videos where the Russian helicopters are all using flares at the same time is because they are communicating via radio. A simple radio call out of ""FLARES!"" tells surrounding strike aircraft that a MANPAD has been fired and all aircraft in the strike group shall take evasive action. 


JDAMs don't use laser designators by the way. They are GPS guided munitions and are typically used on static targets. They can be used in a visual mode which uses a targeting pod which can fire targeting lasers but lasers aren't needed for the visual functionality of the JDAM. The aviators would simply use the TGP to identify a potential target and use coordinates provided to supply the JDAM with targeting information.

Also this is a big reason why these Russian strike aircraft are flying low and fast over areas with high cover. MANPADS require line-of-sight. If the would-be MANPAD user wasn't on a roof-top in plain view then they wouldn't be able to get off a round in time. 

The real big pain in the ass is when you have a mixture of multiple overlapping mobile short and long range RADAR guided missile combined with MANPADS. Without real-life on the ground intelligence even stand-off weapons like JSOW or JASSM won't reach a mobile target.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

These radars are dirt cheap though and extremely reliable, so they're very good for civilian use.

Meanwhile modern flat panel arrays act like a bunch of tiny computer-controlled searchlights or laser beams.  They're intrinsically pretty common & easy to link together different panels, even from different locations, and most modern hardware is built for specifically meshing sensor inputs; since it's all 100% digital it's pretty easy to do.

The real gamechanger is networked imaging w/ thermals, that means that day/night planespotters with basically little more than cellphone cameras can act like organic radar and are almost impossible to spot.  I was reading a few days back a thread of people who'd tracked cruise-missile launches by planespotting the rockets from cellphone cameras and CCTV back to the launch corridor within minutes.

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?

So, essentially as it moves away from the center of gravity (in this instance, think of it as the center of the star although it's a little bit off), it arcs quite slowly, but as it approaches the star it whips around.

Think of this orbit as kind of like a baseball field.  When you're going around the outfield, you're not turning that much in any one step, but as you come around home plate each step has a huge amount of arc in it.

If you draw a line through the middle of home plate, each side has 180 degrees. When you're near home plate, you can walk from one side around to the other in 2 or 3 steps. You've covered those 180 degrees in 2 or 3 seconds. 

Walking the same speed, it will take you what, 10 minutes? 20 minutes? to walk around down to third base, around the outfield, back down to first base, and back to home plate, completing the other 180 degrees and get back to where you started.

The end result of this is that for each degree of bend, when the object is in the outfield, it has many more steps to get across that degree, and so gravity out there, despite being weaker, has more time to act upon it.

With gravitational interactions there are 3 options, collision, escape, and orbit. If an object's speed is below the escape velocity at that distance then it will either collide with the larger body e.g. you on Earth's surface or it will orbit e.g planets/moons/satellites.

The thing is, we just take it that something 'escapes' an orbit, but the assumption there is that gravity affects it by such a small amount that it's negligible. And of course, other larger objects affect a far away body much more.
