Then there was the old, and I mean really old small truck we had at my summer job. I worked at a lodge in a national park in a neighboring state one summer. There was this old truck that was a floor shift which was really the easy part.

One day I was waiting tables for breakfast and got called outside to the truck. All the guys from the garage were there along with all the housekeeping staff who were trying to get to their assigned cabins. No one could start the truck. I got in, set the choke, and started that old truck right up. Seems they had flooded the engine but, while they waited for someone to get me from the dining room enough fuel had drained and setting the choke properly made it just turn over right away.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",1647302435.0,857

lol

OK... it wasn't stolen. And it technically wasn't my first stick ever... I grew up on a farm where having access to stick was a norm so I'd been introduced to the concepts in a growing form (note that tractors and the sort have very different transmissions so don't match 1:1 with a car's tranny).

But the day that I learned to drive an actual stick, all on my own with no assistance, was when I was around 12. My dad was a truck driver who hauled cars. And I'd ride with him all the time to ""spend time"", or to just travel. Like if I was going to visit him in Florida for the summer, I'd ride in the truck rather than fly.

Well he was moving a porsche down for a friend of a friend on heavy discount as a favor. And the guy was being a total dick bag about it and was going to stiff my pops on the money because he thought he could get away with it due to the relationship that tied the 2 together (lets just say my dad was in some unsavory side business back when he was alive).

So my dad was going to have to eat the loss on this one.

Well, while sitting in the palm beach auto auction where he was unloading the rest of his load. He tossed me the keys to the porsche and said:

""I think it's about time you learn to drive stick.""

For 2 hours I drove around that auto auction lighting that clutch on fire!

Trouble is most people are hard on them, so you constantly run into people who replace a clutch every 30-60k like it's routine maintenance, to the point where tons of people will tell you that it is routine maintenance and that you should expect it every 60-100k or whatever. In my experience it's usually the people who hill hold and the people who constantly rest their foot against the clutch when they're not shifting. Hill holding is absolutely awful for your clutch and is a bandaid for people's inability to do hill starts without rolling back, and the foot resting there often turns into slightly riding the clutch 100% of the time without noticing. Lot of people also constantly rest their hand on the shifter (I call it Vin Dieseling) which tends to cause unnecessary synchro wear. 

Granted I'm a big dickwaving manual transmission elitist who learned in a manual from day one of driving, but as far as I'm concerned the clutch on a street car making stock power and doing standard commuter duty is functionally a lifetime part.

That's not the only reason valets are used.   

Some times the parking lot is small and you can't fit all the cars into the spaces (i.e. cars need to be blocked in).   In those cases a valet has access to all the cars keys, and can move cars as needed to get them in and out.

Other times valets have specific lots they have access to as well for parking cars.

Sometimes it's simply convenience rather than laziness.   You're at a hotel, you're checking in, you have bags.

He was the designated driver. We went to a party and I drank more than I should have. He dropped me off ‚Äújust over a block‚Äù from my house. 

When I got out of the back of the car I didn‚Äôt recognize anything. I reached for my phone, but realized that I didn‚Äôt have it. I walked the block looking for a street I knew, but couldn‚Äôt find one. I then picked a direction to walk in to search for a major street. 

Apparently he had thought it‚Äôd be funny to drop me off in the wrong neighborhood instead of at my house and lifted my cell phone off me, so I couldn‚Äôt call for help. Supposedly his plan was to let me wander around lost for like 10 minutes and then find me to actually take me home. He never found me. 

After a few hours of walking around lost I had sobered up and was thirsty. I had found a larger street, but it was like 2am at that point and everything was deserted, so I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone for help. 

Eventually I saw a police car patrolling and flagged them down for help. They told me that I was over 10 miles from my house and that I was in a very unsafe neighborhood. They didn‚Äôt believe my story. After some discussion they offered to give me a ride home, but asked me to put my hands behind my back while they searched me for weapons. I complied and they immediately cuffed me and told me that they were arresting me for public intoxication. 

I didn‚Äôt have money at the time, so I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone to post bail for me. Also I kept getting told that they‚Äôd release me as soon as I was processed, because I was already sober. There were no windows in the holding cell, no clock, and they never dimmed the light, so I and the others had no concept of time. I was fed twice and had access to water and a toilet. I managed to fall asleep a few times, but I kept waking up shivering. 

When I was finally released it was 9am a whole day after I‚Äôd been arrested. My roommate had reported me missing and had been informed that I‚Äôd been arrested. I was able to call my roommate from a pay phone and get him to pick me up. 

A few weeks later I found out that the charge of public intoxication had been dropped, so thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to pay a fine or take DUI classes. 

I have no idea what the hell is wrong with my friend who pranked me. He did apologize and felt bad, but I stopped hanging out with him after that.",1647306662.0,6013

I reported their conduct to their institution so they knew about it (and apparently they already did and had taken action on some of it already). Professional society said they would tell them to leave me alone and I thought that'd be the end of it.

Every month or so they would harass me online. I ignored it, and documented it. Then out of the blue, an anonymous social media account shows up posting death threats against this colleague, and trying to associate those threats with me - that I was responsible for their life being threatened. This colleague posted on their blog that they were in personal danger, further associating it with me. I sent the anonymous account a link to a webpage that grabbed their IP address and device information- and of course it was them posting fake threats against their self. I caught them in the act.

They are still experiencing the consequences of their own actions, and have learned no lessons to this date. Banned from conferences, job duties changed, and restrictions on activities.

When I didn't want to take any of the available classes, he got the principal to approve a class (Sociology 3, in case you're curious) where it would be just me in the class and he ""taught"" it. I didn't have to do shit but hang out with him for an entire period and got an A. Solid deal.

Well, I graduated at semester and he bought me a grad card. He'd filled every single blank space with tiny writing about how much he loved me and couldn't he just keep me. If he couldn't he was feeling like he would kill himself. 

As I type this now, I'm getting creeped out but at 17 I was too naive to see that for what it was, and I'm only giving you about half the story here. Anyway, that's my crazy friend story. Last I heard he quit his job of 20+ years after I graduated and moved to CO. Idk what happened to him from there. 

EDIT: ok, I'm getting some messages about elaborating on this. To be clear, I don't have any trauma associated with the situation.

The relationship started when I was 15. I went to a tiny rural school and even then I stood out in a crowd. Not a brag, it's relevant to understanding how this all came about. 

The teacher was in his late 40s. Never married, and as I learned later, never even had a girlfriend. Very quiet type. I was going through some things at home and I needed a trusted adult. I was drawn to him and confided several things to him, and he was a true friend when I needed one. You can simultaneously be very beautiful and very lonely, as I learned early in life. I took to spending a lot of time in his room, just talking, playing on the chalkboard, nothing more. 

The next year our talks turned to boys, and he tried to give me some advice about not falling for the BS that high school boys do to get in your pants. He was very critical of boys I dated, always pointing out flaws and such. I started driving that year and that put him on edge because he didn't always know the boys I went out with personally. He was constantly asking if I was ok, was I comfortable doing what boys and girls that age do...it seemed like he was looking out for me, protecting me and I believe he was.

I visited him at his house, but he didn't make advances or anything. He did call me in the evenings and weekends quite a bit. He had a stuffed bear I'd given him which he named after me, usually he'd call to say he and ____Bear missed me. 

My senior year was when we had the 1 on 1 class but again it was just talking although by that point we were so close people noticed it. I think I knew he was in love with me, but he never touched me except for a hug here and there and never asked for anything that would make me uncomfortable. 

Other than the card, he never did anything odd. We confided a lot in each other, and we were two people who needed one another at the time. If I had to do it again I'd make the same choices.

Neither of us were particularly mentally healthy, I was very depressed and he is a narcissist. We had a very tumultuous breakup, I moved away for college and came back a year later. We were friends. He had convinced himself in the time I was gone that we were going to be getting back together, but at that point I‚Äôd had enough time away to realize how terribly manipulative and cruel he was the entire time we were together so I was NOT about it. He kept telling me he wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer and he‚Äôd convince me. I kinda just ignored him, did my own thing. Hooked up with a mutual friend that I‚Äôd known way longer than I knew my ex, it had nothing to do with him but he took it personally. He found out, and wrote a song (he had an aspiring ‚Äúrap career‚Äù) about how much he hated me and wanted to kill me. Had my full name in it and everything. Turned every single one of my friends against me whether they thought I did anything wrong or not. Stalked me for three years and I have no idea if he‚Äôs still interested in me or not. I have an entire album in my phone of screenshots for court if it comes to that. He showed up at my moms house (he didn‚Äôt realize I wasn‚Äôt living there anymore), stalked my current boyfriend, showed up at my jobs, made multiple accounts to reach me on all social media. The shit he has sent me is INSANE. Like, psychotic thinks-he‚Äôs-Shakespeare kind of stuff. Half of it doesn‚Äôt make any sense. The horny messages are the scariest. I still have nightmares about him being in my house all the time. Terrible stuff

You know that video clip of the Alaskan news anchor quitting on air after blurting that she supports recreational marijuana or whatever from like 2015ish? 

Claims that he watched it live. Straight faced, no bullshit. ""He walked into the living room and his parents watch strange TV sometimes.""

We do not live in Alaska.

That was the start of the embellishments that we remember. One possible grain of truth in a WILD and CRAZY story.

Every. Story. It got tiring.

What did it in, finally, was him and another brother in law apparently swapping ""dude I was so messed up that night"" stories and insinuated something to the effect of ""I drug women to have sex with them."" Not date rape, but... coerced date rape? Regardless-

WHAT.THE.FUCK. What in blue fuck inspires a person to fabricate a story like that, about a friend? To this day have no idea what fucking ""dude I was so messed up last night"" story of mine had any possible connotation like that or if it was a complete and utter fabrication.

I learned about that, thanks to amazing people like my extended family who realized how bad and weird that was for him to say about me behind my back, and dude came over to my house totally unrelated shortly thereafter. We said nothing about it, I waited to see if like, he would act different or like ""realize what he had just said about me to my extended family days earlier."" Because you've got to be pretty fucking dense to not think a story with rape connotations is not going to immediately come around the horn within family.

Never brought it up. We hung out. He left. Day or two later, I forget what shortly what finally set me off (probably another embellished story or some grandiose claim online) and that was the last straw. I let him have it.

The fact I started getting novels about how it wasn't *really* his fault and he was worried about me and my mental health (what the fuck, and you were in my house with me solo and said nothing? nice try) and otherwise novels upon novels about anything else told me everything I needed to know. He didn't care, saying anything to save face.

Blew up my phone, blew my brother in laws up, blew my sister and sister in law up, started blowing up an ex of his that we all knew-- it was INSANE how many words came out of him in 72 days to like 7 different people. I only caught one block that was mostly copy pasta.

Did not once apologize or take accountability for his shit. Not one time, to any person. It's either borderline or narcissism (or both, or something else along that anti-social spectrum).

I got a small inheritance and told my high school girlfriend about it like a trusting loving romantic dumbass, wasn't a lot just a bit to help with college and get me going. She went ahead and told me everything and anything I wanted to hear until my money ran out then she was gone.

Little did I know that she was sleeping around and then freaking absolutely out anytime I wanted to make friends or go out, unless she was there with me but when it came to me going out with her when she was invited places ... Oh no. The fight would begin with me telling her to fuck off and end with her crying and wailing and calling me a manipulative asshole etc. Etc. Bleh.

Only when she left her diary ( yes people still use those) did I read about her other lovers.

We picked out a small house and I was helping her pay for college and we had just signed up at a local gym together down the street from the house, been together for four years.

It wasn't all bad. She kept our cat then he died shortly after since she didn't know what she was doing and he had a ton of veterinary bills in the end she had to cover on her own. Actually found out he died through a friend and when I asked her about it one time she hit me up for more money!

So I decided to get as far away from my life as possible (about 4000 miles, across an ocean). I walked the streets of London, saw a glacier in Norway, stood in front of the pyramids in Egypt, danced under the cherry blossoms in Tokyo... I could go on, but I think you understand.

Those experiences gave me something real, something to hold on to.

I haven't seen the northern lights yet, so I think I'll just have to stick around for awhile.

Suicidal thoughts create a self-sustaining cycle of guilt, regret, distance, and then more guilt. 

We feel guilty for wanting to leave the people who love us behind. It feels like a betrayal of their trust. No matter how little value we have to ourselves, we have value to them, and on some level we know that removing ourselves from their lives does nothing but pass that pain on to someone else.

The guilt then manifests into regret for the things we aren‚Äôt appreciating right now because we are so caught up in our own self-pity. Why don‚Äôt we spend more time with them, why don‚Äôt we go out more, why don‚Äôt we just fake it until we feel okay.

The reason why we don‚Äôt do any of those things is because the thoughts will always, always, come back. We will always feel that way again, and to save ourselves from feeling the guilt, we create distance. We actively push people away from us to protect ourselves in the event that we do decide to go through with it. 

I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that if I haven‚Äôt done it yet, I probably won‚Äôt ever do it. But this cycle both keeps you alive and wears down your will to live.

I was waiting to be picked up and went to a little store to buy some cookies. I thought of them as my last meal.

So, needless to say, he was ancient, required five pills a day, and had at least one pet ER visit every month. And if I died, who the hell was going to take him? No one. No one was going to want this wretched fuck, and he was the only thing who had ever saw me get fucked up and go, ""You know what? No. Not today,"" and then proceed to do damage the likes of which I could only really appreciate post facto. 
Every time I wanted to die because I was too tired of being in danger, because I was too tired of being alone, because everything was too much? Well, that didn't matter because he'd come in, sit on whatever it was I needed to get done, and I'd look at his crusty eyes and his nasty teeth three different animal dentists wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole (nasty heart murmur issues), and go, ""Fuck, man. I'm doing this for you.""
And the best part? He knew it. The vet gave him six months to live eventually. He dragged it out for another year and a half before I put him down with all the love and pity in my heart.

My ex died last August from a drug overdose in the woods. Well honestly in an empty lot next to a construction site. It was egregious and terrible and brutal for him, and not the way any human being should be photographed by police or remembered by their parents. 

Was it a drug overdose as suicide? Was it a garden variety drug overdose? I think there's a 90% chance it was overdose as suicide, his mother doesn't feel that and I would never try to change her mind. 

Regardless of the method though, even if it had been some magical peaceful method (and you know it's a cruel joke that mother nature makes damn sure it's impossible to kill ourselves peacefully) it wasn't about the photographs or what his mother had to see. 

It was the fact her child was taken from her. Adult child but still her son. The people we are put here in the world to love beyond all reason and protect and guide into the future beyond us. It breaks a person. 

She thinks about him everyday. She hurts everyday. I check in on her occasionally and we touch base. There's not going to be a day that goes by in her life that she doesn't think of her dead son. And there have been a very few days between August and today that I haven't thought about him. 

Even though I have an extremely demanding life and a child and so many responsibilities I can't get everything done.

I guess I should tell the rest of the story.

I almost never have those thoughts now, mostly due to surviving an actual accidently injury.

After 2 years of struggling with persistent desire to end it all, I had finally decided to just give in. I had my plan, and decided that the next time I had an emotional/psychological meltdown I would drive up to this particular waterfall I was familiar with and finally be done with it.

But on the day of my injury I was not having a meltdown. I was having an amazing run during an outdoor exercise class at my gym. It was a beautiful day, my endorphins were high, and I was feeling strong. Then suddenly I felt a snap in my leg, and the most incredible pain, far more intense than childbirth. The pain in my leg was so severe that I couldn't brace myself for the fall and my face hit the sidewalk first. My face was a bloody mess, which was scaring others, but didn't matter to me at all because my leg hurt so incredibly much. 

Eventually I went into shock so the pain subsided. My mind drifted, as it often did, to my waterfall plan. I wondered if this was the universe's way of giving me a little taste of the kind of pain I would be in for. 

Because of the blood loss and sudden drop in blood pressure, I started loosing consciousness. I was completely mesmerized by these 2 elaborate geometric shapes. Those 2 shapes and their orangish-yellow color were everything, they were the universe, and they were me. Then I became aware of the panicked voices of the  first-responders, and realized that I was becoming unresponsive. 

I mused at the irony, the absolute ridiculousness of the possibility of me dieing, not noblely alone in the forest, but in front of the entire gym. And my ego took me to another place. I didn't want to be talked about as that weirdo who tripped and bled out. So, I tried to lift my head and respond, but realized I couldn't. And I became aware that the geometric shapes were separate from me, that they were still all important, but we weren't One.

Next thing I know I am in an ambulance with an IV in my arm.

My ACL had completely snapped apart and I had broken bones in the interior of my ankle. My waterfall plan got replaced with a goal to be able to walk without a limp, and to someday be able to run again. And I am happy to say that I have now met that goal.

Yeah, the universe wants us all here. The void is out there, and some of us may always feel its draw, but it's not for us. Life is for us, all of us. That's what those shapes told me.",1647304439.0,1061

He told this man that, because his wife had Alzheimer's, she was basically dead already, so it would be perfectly OK to divorce and remarry.

This absolutely enraged me. My mother had Alzheimer's, plus was pretty much bedbound from a stroke, and a lot more things wrong. When she had her stroke, she told my dad that she'd ""release him from his marriage vows"" and he could leave because she didn't want to be a burden.

He didn't leave. He didn't give her up for dead. Because his VA benefits were shit, and wouldn't pay for a home health care aide, he was her sole caretaker for the last two years of her life. He did everything for her - fed her, cleaned her, gave her meds, dealt with the mood swings and the memory loss, all of it. 

When she was terminally ill, he moved heaven and earth to get her into hospice because he knew she hated the hospital and wouldn't want to die there, even though by that time, she was unresponsive.

My priests were lovely. Couldn‚Äôt fiddle kids because there just wouldn‚Äôt have been time in the day with all of the actual humanitarian work they had going. If they had been bad people. 

I remember once being 14, drunk, at a house party at 2am where I felt uncomfortable. I couldn‚Äôt call my mother, because I lied about where I was that night and didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. 

I needed to get home but had no idea who to call. For some reason I had my youth pastors number, even though I had only gone to youth services once or twice. 

I called him and drunk explained; and he was there in 5 minutes, in sweatpants and clearly just out of sleeping. 

He went through the drive through coffee place and got me a coffee and then talked with me on the 30 minute ride to my parents house. 

It never once felt judgmental. We didn‚Äôt talk about god or the Bible per say. 

When I apologized for calling him (despite hardly knowing him) and cried for feeling bad, and cried that my moms Jewish, so I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm allowed to ask his help, he nicely told me that it didn‚Äôt matter how often I skipped church. Or youth group or if I believed in anything, Old Testament or new. 

That he took the job because he wanted to prove God in the way he was meant to; by being a Good Samaritan and caring about people. And he didn‚Äôt mind losing sleep, because bringing me home safely was what Catholicism is about; doing the right thing. 

He never brought it up again, but when I saw him he would greet me warmly and ask how I was. Even if I was a random kid off the street that didn‚Äôt have a religion really. 

Some people are just called for that kind of work, and don‚Äôt mind living poor and doing good things for no return. They actually practice what they preach.

Bateman slides his card across the table; it's off-white, with the words PATRICK BATEMAN: VICE PRESIDENT centred and embossed in black.

Bateman leans back in his chair.
""Picked 'em up from the printers yesterday.""

He whips out his card, laying it next to Bateman's on the table. Off-white with the words ROBERT VAN PATTEN: VICE PRESIDENT centred and embossed in black, it is basically indistinguishable.
""Egg shell, with Roman.""
Bateman smiles bitterly.
""Nice.""
Now a third broker pulls out his card. It looks exactly like the first two, except it reads TIMOTHY BRICE: VICE PRESIDENT.

I see a whole bunch of suggestions here, which seem way too premature for the state the game's in. I wouldn't recommend doing anything related to progression, realistic damage, and stuff like that before you figure out the core gameplay loop and make it even more appealing. Progression should come later to complement your gameplay. Lots of other stuff recommended here should come even later.

If you can, I'd love to see a dissolve or rot effect added to the roots as they disappear rather than it just blanking out in chunks. 

Reactions from the humans being smacked would also not go amiss. Some minor stumble or shake, anything to lead credence to there having been an impact.

I don't mind the backhoe exploding as it does, but if you can't destroy the stone building in one pass you shouldn't be able to walk through it doing passive damage. You should bounce off, while doing damage to the structure at that point. With smacks or stomps doing damage in an AoE in front of you by comparison.

And yes, as other people pointed out, if the humans can take more than one hit, the equipment should be a bit tougher too unless you have some kind of special ability to entangle them with roots. Nature beats jenga tower technology after all.",1647314195.0,1

The concept is very cool, but you can probably see how it could feel pretty lethargic to play. Movement speed is very low. It's fine for the identity of the player but if they have to traverse long sections it will become frustrating. The swing of the hand is very unsatisfying. The acceleration curve could use some tweaking to make the peak speed of the attack faster. You also more or less must add more screen shake and extra effects like bright flashes to make it more juicy.

Thoughts:

*End of level, main character plants itself into ground and blooms, grows leaves. The less damage you took, the greater the bloom.  

*collect bird nests and small animals (eg squirrels) as bonuses. They can help you fight.

*weather effects? Wind, snow, rain, lightning. 

*have a move where you can plant your roots deep. It limits movement, exposing you to danger, but allows for unique powerful attacks. 

*Maybe a stealth level where you can hide motionless until humans pass? 

*I‚Äôd love to see some unique environment interactions like walking through electrical wires and they break and drop with sparks, crossing a busy road and cars are swerving out of the way, jumping in a river (floating?)

*Finale in a giant lumbar mill with huge saws, wood chippers, and the like. Basically a horror movie for trees. Maybe the player has to free all the trees about to get cut up?",1647312559.0,2

This is fucking awesome. Do it. 

There should be different varieties of mushrooms that come up in place of the corpses. 

Most trees depend on fungi, generally several different species, to germinate, grow and absorb nutrients. The fungi surround the roots and increase the surface area by a factor of 100.

> I'm currently still playing with the level of destruction per element. But I'll take your feedback into account, thank you once again! :)

I used to work as a welder repairing heavy equipment. Excavators like that are massively overbuilt which is why they move so slow and why they need caterpillar tracks to support their weight. The boom arm is usually 3/8- 1/2 (13mm) thick steel plate of very high strength steel, premium quality stuff. It's a pain to weld because you have to preheat it to prevent the welds from cracking if they cool too quickly, because the structure is so rigid. Operators abuse the hell out of those things so they make them literally bulletproof. Can be up to 50mm/2"" around the pivot pins. Operators sometimes use the arm to drag the entire weight of the machine up a muddy slope. They're also of course rigorously designed not to catch on fire. You can guarantee somone somehere has unintentionally gone out of their way to try setting them on fire. See-Murphys Law.

So I feel like the best tactic in this scenario would be to flip the machine on it's side, or else attack the cab side and come at the driver, ""I am groot"" style. It's not just going to blow away in the breeze. You could just trigger a cracked glass image and some blood spatter on the windows. 

Probably one of the few objects in game that's should be deliberately non destructible. 

Another fun game mechanic might be keeping other creepers from climbing up into the cab and starting it up again. I'm envisioning a boss-fight scenario here where you play king of the hill.

But they come back and eat the third one on the spot.

And it works every time, I am very easily manipulated by small woodland creatures.",1647307039.0,2

Wife and I have been feeding this squirrel for a few years now. We can tell it‚Äôs the same one because it has this scar on its side.

They arent meant to keep inside. Only time thats ok is for rehabilitation or rescue of an injured animal. They are meant to be wild. 

I love animals and the best way to show that, is to let wild animals remain wild and enjoy them in their natural habitat. 

FYI: Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other forms of direct contact with infected squirrels. Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid. Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease, Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. - googled information.",1647282736.0,9

Much as I love Plant, let that guy cash his Allison Krauss checks (richly deserved as those are both great albums) and get Joe Duplantier.

JPJ only gets the nod as a producer and arranger. Garstka is precise, capable of tricky times and has more ""swing"" than either Abasi or Reyes. I suggest Gleason because, while Baroness are heavy, they're pretty accessible - kind of a stepping stone back to arena rock, I guess, and Gleason's guitar work is a big part of that. Duplantier's ability to shift from growls to clean vocals offers interesting interplay with Parton's high, gentle voice and his solid groove in his rhythm playing would provide a great drive.",1647314465.0,1

There's a reason why Shania Twain and Clay Aiken aren't still pumping out at least passable good music, but Madonna is. Madonna works with the best. Always. Fresh, new, new sounds, beautiful tracks. It's possible for Dolly, and even a Britney Spears, if they get a fresh new crew. Honestly, I'd only trust Madonna to manage teams for older stars, as odd as that is to say. She's has the best track record and longevity and an uncanny ear for the next new sound under her belt. She can hear or see something totally new and just know how it will work.

Dolly re-did Old Flames beautifully with Keshsa on her ""I'm a real artist"" album. Jack White blew his pud on Loretta Lynn. I would suggest someone who still has a fight in their belly. A great writer and lover of Dolly. The writer would have to know her, and still have a fight. As risky as this sounds, I'd hire Diane Warren to co-write, and Madonna to produce.

Resident evil Nemesis(I think) I nearly shit myself when the damn nemesis busted through a window on the way down some stairs. 

Chrono trigger/cross were awesome rpgs. 

It opened up the many worlds of final fantasy to me, which i have played ever since. Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are my favorites. Wish there was a standalone Blitzball game we could play.

What‚Äôs crazy is how going to rent a movie or video game was a common occurrence for pretty much my whole life up until 10 years or so ago. I mean, nearly every weekend we would go and get one or two movies and one video game for the week (or however long it was, I think movies were more like 1 or 2 nights and games were like 3 or 4)

In my town, the last movie rental store literally closed last year. I don‚Äôt think they actually still rented movies, they only made money off of people using tanning beds lol",1647317453.0,3

6058,pics,[OC] The last Blockbuster on earth is in my home town,WantedDadorAlive,1647294376.0,442,8308,0.96,"It's weird how the environment so heavily affects the psychology of the decision making. Video stores, especially with those frustrating and restricting bundle deals were a very good way to discover new films by getting ones that you wouldn't have bothered with otherwise because you already picked all the ones you actually wanted but you need 1 or 2 more to make up the bundle. Or you got there and your choice was all rented out and you didn't want to go empty handed. Overall, these things sucked and it's part of why the stores were so hastily dumped in favour of streaming (aside from just not having to go to the place itself), but it did kind of force one in to a different mode of thinking when it came time to make the choice. This especially with videogames where I was much less fussy than with films so would happily rent a game I'd never consider buying and often find I liked it. You can 'rent' media now and if you wanted you could probably browse the options by looking at cover art to make your choice, but somehow when selecting off a screen I can't help but be more discerning, I guess there's no scarcity involved or trying to make up bundles. It should be more freeing and in many ways it is, but is also tends to have the effect of making one more tunnel visioned and less open to more 'random' choices. I used to discover films entirely because they were in the same 'arthouse' or 'action' section of the shelf and they looked cool and while an online experience would group similarly and serve up thumbnails in that way, it somehow doesn't work the same in my head as when it's the physical box.

Things like Netflix kind of make this worse by actively trying to make offerings based on what you've consumed which only entrenches the tunnel vision of content but even without that it doesn't quite work the same.",1647332883.0,1

However, Downtown Houston and particularly Downtown Dallas both have pretty good walking scores. Downtown Dallas was a bunch of deserted office skyscrapers when I lived there but I hear it has gotten better.

EDIT: Since people are getting confused, Houston and Dallas being ranked 24th and 26th walkability score of large American cities is a VERY BAD ranking. The website is saying that Dallas and Houston are car dependent and UNWALKABLE. So everyone replying saying, ""That website is wrong! Houston and Dallas are terrible to walk!"" Yes, that's exactly what the website is also saying. The ""downtown"" neighborhoods that have decent walk scores are pretty small areas of both Dallas and Houston which are only a handful of blocks large. But overall, the cities suck in terms of walkability.",1647292332.0,55

During the freeze last year we were standing in line to cut up untreated lumber to burn, for the few that could skid down the road to the lowes. I think we were out of propane too. I found one small tank and used a blow torch to defrost drain pipes. You have to drip faucets all winter so they don't freeze but during the power outage, that froze up the drains. 

Anyway, we're closing on our house there soon hopefully and already left for good. The power outage and the following pipe bursts was the final straw on an already broken back.

My experience with transit has varied based on where I have lived, but I've always been within walking distance of a grocery store. I specifically have chosen where to live based on proximity to a grocery store and access to transit, and it's not necessarily expensive. In 2017-18 I was in fort worth walking distance from a grocery store and transit hub, and 2018-2021 I was in Houston near a variety of frequent bus routes and walking distance to a grocery store, as well as multiple restaurants and shops. My rent in fort worth was $699 and in Houston $799, both for a one bedroom between 600-800 square feet. 

But I have also always explicitly made the choice for those amenities. Back in 2017 I specifically sought out a work from home job, and have been working from home ever since. I always check transit access for places I'm moving to, and make sure that the transit connects to where I'd want to go for things like recreation, errands, and shopping. I got a folding bike in order to be able to easily take my bike on trains and extend the area I could easily access from transit. I make very frequent trips to the grocery store, about 2-3 times per week, each trip usually being about 30 minutes round trip if I'm dallying, since I have to carry everything home myself. I accept that trips themselves take longer and plan accordingly (though I have way more usable time than if I drove everywhere).

Texas is huge. And most people in Texas likes to think that their slice of Texas is the best version of Texas, from Austin to hill country to ranch towns in west Texas. Which means every Texan outside of [insert Texan city] can't agree on who's best, but they can agree to throw shade on that city (unless they're actually from that city).

My take: Dallas represents Texas just fine. It's a huge metro with great variety and diversity inside it. And yes: it's sprawling.

I took a few minor creative liberties here and there in spaces where I could not figure out the exact details of the original or in areas where I could not find a 100% replacement HQ part for it .. or in some cases where I just felt minor changes enhanced the result but did not deviate much from the original.

Here are a few of the reasons for that feeling:

- the sweater pattern is mechanical and all aligned, which wouldn't be the case on a real sweater

- the sweater and shirt both feel composited in, and the shirt is both in and out of focus

- focus drifts and disagrees at different points: for example, her ear (and neck) is out of focus but the hair in front of and behind her ear are both in focus

- the coloration of her face is splotchy and transitions abruptly from olive to rosy and back again",1647258472.0,54

1. The sweater looks flat and the pattern used is incorrect. Feels like a texture on early 2000s game where polygons were more scarce than water is on moon. Similar problem with the shirt.

3. It feels too sharp.

4. Her smile is gone.

Remini has already been discussed, but I am unfamiliar with it (I imagine it's similar to DFDNet). Recently with stylegan2 some interesting ideas have been implemented. One with particular promise is time-travel re-photography in which the latent space is queried for a similar looking face to the input image, and then the AI face is converged toward the input image.  

[AI Comparisons of this face](https://i.imgur.com/W6bUmq0.jpg)   

I would say the GFPGAN output actually produces a really believable result and better represents that age of the subject (I think there is a decade of difference across these photos).

One thing I would consider working on is the background and levels. The thing that has the most artificial impression overall is the background fading into black in the lower left of the picture, because it contrasts with her very colorful cheeck which is receiving light from that area. its much brighter in the original source. I can see the stylistic choice you might have made for a portrait shot, but it might require darkening the cheek just a litte bit. very fine hair on the cheek receiving backlight to add a smooth fade for the silhouette might help sell it even more.",1647260480.0,1

However, I think that it is important to colorize photos, especially in a historical sense. Most people's historical reference point starts with their birth. When they see a b&w photo of say Ruby Bridges as a child being escorted, the technology to produce the original photo gives it an ancient, 'so long ago' reference. When viewing the same photo of Ruby Bridges being escorted, but this time in color, gives the photo the right historical framework as in 'not that long ago'.

1. It looks like there is a curl of her hair in the original that has been removed/confused with background plant life - would be good to add that back in as it looks a bit too clean on that side
2. As a result of this, the 'indent' around the outside corner of her right eye is also absent, giving it a less naturally rounded appearance. As a result it looks like her cheek is basically in line with her brow/forehead rather than curving in at the top.

There is a colorized image of our fire department from the 1920s in my local bank that drives me nuts. Whoever colorized it made the New Jersey flag red instead of yellow. Although, it's also clear that it was done before modern computer tools.

1. Fix any photo damage and over exposed areas.
2. Expand the image for better composition and fill out the areas that need to be. I did that in this case but ended up replacing the entire background anyway coz there was barely anything there.
3. Remove noise as much as possible while trying not to wash out information in order to be able to used later.
4. Spend hours trying to find the closest high quality replacement from stock photos for all the facial features / skin / hair / and other stuff in the photo.
5. Spend more time trying to morph and blend them all to match with the original as much as possible. Improvise when there's no information. Spend a lot of time on this step because the more accurate you can make it, the better the final result will be.
6. Do a base color coating on the entire image.
7. Study the materials in the image and try to overpaint on all of them trying to replicate the material effects -- glossiness, refraction, reflections, specular detail, subsurface scattering for the skin and transparent materials and etc. The more time spent on this, the more realistic the final image will be.
8. Add noise and some intentional photo distortion to make it look like a photo and less like an overpainted image
9. Get lazy after all that work and find hackjobs for less important areas coz it can get tiring.
10. Do a final color grade / lighting fix / overpaint to fix anything that stands out too much.
11. Save and post to reddit.

Here's a WIP GIF of another restoration I did a while ago. This is not the same kind of restoration work as the OP ..but it does kind of outline my process a bit. This one is missing an entire overpaint layer that I now do for skin and etc. [https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessZigzagIcelandicsheepdog-mobile.mp4)

Thank you :)

**Edit:** [https://i.imgur.com/QnNwnL4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QnNwnL4.jpg) \-- If anyone is wondering what kind of effect does overpainting have, here's a crop from an image I am working on at the moment. This is still not finished but you can see that even the most basic levels of painting can really make the image feel sharper and nicer.

I mean, there is a picture there of people farming in bright red shirts! Lots of color wasn't just some luxury thing in past centuries, it was as normal as today. Obviously we have more choices and ways of imparting colors, but people regularly wore colorful clothing in the past too, all over the world. And decorated their surroundings in bright colors. Black and white photos are great, because the alternative is almost entirely either nothing, or portraits of the rich. The portraits do show us the colors they had available, but they are biased because they're being paid for, and they create bias in us because the only color we see is worn by the aristocracy. It is also part of the reason that I like Vincent van Gogh's work - he shows how things of his day *felt.* You can look at his work and know what it was like to be where and when he was and it is beautiful.",1647269908.0,112

The change in my world from 0-10 may have been incredible from a scientific view, or an outsider's view...but for me, it goes from being a kid, to still being a kid..  From 10-20, though, enough personal change happens that it could easily be broken into multiple time/emotional groups.  From 20's on out...my views have changed, my circumstances have changed, my lifestyle has changed...but in perspective, I still feel the same person.  So time doesn't feel as impactful.

So things that happened 10 years ago to me, feel very much like they could have only happened last year.  The passing of time just doesn't hit as strongly.  There is little difference from one year to another.  (Taking out huge milestones like the pandemic, 9/11, etc...just considering day to day events)

But as a kid, each year or two years brought about a lot more change.  So time and individual time periods had greater impact.  So that is my perspective on passing time, where I felt it having more of an impact in my life.  During that time, 50 years prior was the 1930's.  Intellectually, I know that is now nearly 100 years ago...but emotionally, it still feels that same 50 yr period as it did when I was coming to terms with life and everything about it.

Time is definitely relative.  And perception becomes one's reality.",1647266035.0,10

You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston. Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the stream of history.

Putins entire reign is underpinned by chaos theory and this fits with that. I know it's probably not a good idea to be looking for a guiding hand behind everything but she's a Kremlin mouthpiece who's now publicly denounced the war. It feels very neat. Guaranteed to get views, shows Russia as a country that's divided, her treatment will be the important divining rod for what this actually was. (Edit here too) I really think the average person hasn't got a clue what Putin has actually done in Russia in his time in power - their first instinct is to believe everything they see (good and bad) and that's absolutely the last thing you should do with Putin's regime. He has orchestrated so many bizarre events and directly funded so many different groups (including groups who directly oppose him) that no one knows who's in favour or what opinion is popular with the regime at any given time. He's not some mega overlord genius but he has employed chaos theory in governance (we know this definitively) and thusly nothing should be taken at face value. 

It'll be interesting to see what Putin does in the years after the war. My guess is a lot of higher ups get thrown under the bus and Putin declares them traitors who worked against the Russian and Ukrainian interest. This was after all purely a special operation to protect Ukrainians from nazis so if any general or intelligence officer failed in that remit...well obviously it wasn't what Russia was there for.

Edit - because the internet is thick as pigshit - I know Russia is invading Ukraine to try to annex territory and had the intention of (re)installing a puppet regime. The above is a guess at what putin will do to distance himself from atrocities and reduce the risk of resentment towards himself.",1647333018.0,1

Obviously hackers getting to these things first is ideal, but it's primarily an information war. People also massively overestimate the number of people needed to achieve a domino effect - successful violent revolutions have the support of around 5% of the country historically speaking, the rest will usually just go along.

Individuals holding up signs, while good for their personal conscience, is not going to work unless they're being visibly beaten or shot in the streets. People disappearing into a police van/bus doesn't get the same sense of rage from bystanders who are just going to think ""well this is just how things are, this will be my fate too"".

Most wealthy people‚Äôs super yachts are far more expensive than their main homes. Roman Abramovich owns 300 million in real estate and around 1.5 billion in yachts. 

These guys all own jets but not the private jets most people know of. They buy BBJ‚Äôs and ACJ‚Äôs. Google ‚ÄúBoeing Business Jet and Airbus Corporate Jet. They are the size of commercial jets, turned into flying mansions. Normal private jets start at a few million dollars and max out at around 70-80 million dollars. These BBJ‚Äôs START at $100M and that‚Äôs just the start. Some are $300M for a converted BBJ 777. 

Super cars they have as well. Russia is prominent in the ultra luxury drag racing scene. There are tons of YouTube videos of Russians drag racing million dollar hypercars. Again, we aren‚Äôt talking your average ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs 200k Lamborghini.‚Äù We are talking $5M Bugattis, Paganis, and hypercars made by other companies. Cars worth 25 times a lambo. 

You haven‚Äôt heard about it because you haven‚Äôt sought out the knowledge. This isn‚Äôt stuff people just know about because generally you don‚Äôt just hear about Boeing Business Jets. Everyone talks about G7‚Äôs and stuff as if it is the end goal. No way. The real baller shit is the BBJ‚Äôs. As always, the real baller shit is the stuff people don‚Äôt know about. Not the stuff people do know about.",1647323881.0,16

we're not so different. i mean our nation *started out* with the genocide of an entire continent of peoples... and then the subjugation of black people for hundreds of years after that...sooooo... the US doesn't have a good track record when it comes to human atrocities. sure, we're better now, although are we really?

although in this case with russia and ukraine it's a bit over the top evil for no real reason. well for money. same reason the US actually invaded vietnam, or afghanistan, or iran, etc. it's all about money/oil. in general the USA is no better than any other place when it comes to greed like that.

it's not like US soldiers haven't knowingly murdered innocent people across the sea, and then got pardoned by trump for murdering innocent women and children on purpose just cuz the soldiers wanted to have some ""fun."" and those are just the ones that got charged. that shit happens way too often.

In fact, the US is generally one of the worst in the whole world. That's why so many other countries hate the US. Because the US exploits them afar, to gain benefits at home. most countries/people's are justified in their hate of america.

The funny thing about communism is that there was a shadow capitalist system the whole time, with people trading favours to arbitrage the centralised planning. This was horrendously illegal and people doing it risked their lives, however some became truly wealthy.

Enforcement of the trades was done outside the legal system, much like the drug industry today - with brutal violence.

2) Of those that did how many missiles would launch vs just sit there doing nothing?

3) Of those that attempted to launch, how many would blow up in the tubes?

4) Of those that cleared the tubes how many would make orbit?

5) Of those that made orbit how many would track to the actual target?

6) Of those that start tracking to target how many would get through the missile shields?

Putin has got his hands dirty on multiple occasions over the past 10 years - he doesn't just make idle threats.

Regardless of the state of the Russian nuclear arsenal you can be pretty damn sure that some of those missiles will get through. 

Maybe it wouldn't be a complete apocalypse (in the West), but tell that to the millions of dead people London, New York, Washington, Paris, Berlin and all the other major US and European cities that no doubt have multiple Russian warheads targeted at them. 

Tell that to all the Russians who will undoubtedly die when the US/Europeans retaliate with a full strike (which will probably be triggered automatically if the Russians even look like they are going ballistic).

Tell that to the billions who will then probably die as a result of a global collapse in supply chains, potential nuclear winter and nuclear fallout.

*  We know Putin has a track record of following through with threats
*  We know Putin is in his 70's (he is already older than the average life expectancy of most Russian men)
*  We know that Putin is increasingly paranoid
*  We know that Putin will do anything to 'restore Russian pride' and has a hard-on for taking the US down a peg or two.

You really want to fucking gamble that Putin will not start a nuclear war at the potential cost of a completely fucked up world?

Maybe 75% of his nukes will malfunction, maybe some of the 'yes-men' he has put in place over the past 20 years will grow some balls and not go along with the plan, maybe God will save us - who the fuck knows, but I would certainly not be willing to gamble millions/potentially billions of lives when Russia will probably self-destruct on its own shortly anyway.

IIRC Evil Dead II was the original Sam Raimi script that was re-written as a ""teens"" in the woods to get it greenlit. Once that was made, done, released, he got greenlit for the sequel which was essentially him just making the movie he orig wanted to.

BTW the orig evil dead ends with the morning arriving and him standing in front of the cabin just for something evil to come up from the ground, rush through the cabin, and attack ash, the end.

The splice scene is after the first 10 minutes of the second movie goes by and the first morning arrives for him, and he's standing out in front of the cabin only for the evil to rise up, rush through the cabin, grab ash, and take him through the forest.

My girlfriend was embarrassed after about 20 minutes when I was laughing so hard I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath. The movie audience of about 35 was completely silent but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. We were supposed to be scared and serious, especially the gore crowd from fans of the first Evil Dead, but pretty soon people caught on when I couldn‚Äôt be silenced and they started to realize it was ok to have a belly laugh at a horror movie.

Funny thing is, I was thinking about ED2 and Peter Jackon's Braindead just the other day after seeing Very Bad Things for the first time, a movie that IMO is just a terrible failure as a ""comedy"" because it's so mean-spirited, cruel and jarring in tone. I found the whole movie a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable experience and I am fine with straight, dark horror movies and gory comedies normally. It really reminded me how important consistent tone is.

ED2 always has me laughing out loud (to tears!) at horrible things happening to people, because it's so masterfully handled. Drag Me To Hell is another good example; very dark at times but the comedy is genuinely hilarious too.

Evil Dead 2 and Braindead both have gruesome gore and scares, but also zaney comical gags too. They're insanely creative in both visuals and performance.

Also Sam Raimi got Spider-Man after proving he could handle serious stuff too with films like A Simple Plan and The Gift. He showed he had heart with For Love of The Game, and he showed he could do blockbuster action with The Quick and The Dead. He basically proved himself worthy of Spider-Man during the 90‚Äôs.

Peter Jackson was somewhat similar, but also you have to remember Lord of The Rings wasn't really supposed to be an Oscar contender. Peter Jackson convinced New Line to give him all the money upfront so he could shoot all three back to back. That way if the first bombed they could still release the other two and have a better chance of turning a profit. It was a gamble, but Peter Jackson handled it masterfully.

There‚Äôs horror all over the series. The books are very scary. Mordor and Sauron‚Äôs primary power is literal terror. 

What other kind of director can showcase an ‚Äúinanimate object‚Äù negatively affecting everyone and everything around it? To give you a sense of fear and dread up front of what it would mean to the world if this power was unleashed. 

There are so many epic heroic moments. They all stand on the foundation of confronting and facing the terror. To be a literal little person in a big world and stand up to the evil.

After the small success of E.D., Sam decided to redo it. But all the Chosen One stuff and Annie and all that were things Sam came up with much later. Hell, Scotty is the hero of part 1. Not Ash.",1647314515.0,4

It‚Äôs beautifully animated, but the story is weak and kind of nonsensical. The music is alright, most of the songs are pretty catchy (‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Talk About Bruno‚Äù is overrated AF, and the best song is the one She-Hulk sings), but mostly sound like generic pop music with a radio-friendly structure and sound rather than a theatrical/movie musical structure and sound. The lyrics can get clumsily busy, and I really wanted to hear a soundtrack/score that sounds more Latin American than what was ultimately offered. There‚Äôs only a few hints of Latin Jazz, Cumbia, and Habanera here and there. The music just comes across as generic and easily replaced, most of it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs part of the movie. 

   There‚Äôs also so many characters in this movie with the writers trying to fully flesh out each one, but it falls flat in a movie made for the attention span of children.  Seriously, there are so many characters it‚Äôs impossible to remember all their names unless you‚Äôve seen the movie multiple times. The only name I can remember is Bruno, and only because his name is in a song title. Had to come up with nicknames for them that either describe their powers or their relationships to other characters, like Animal Boy, Brown Poison Ivy, Batgirl, ADHD Nightcrawler, the aforementioned She-Hulk, Narcissistic Grandma, Main Girl, Animal Boy‚Äôs Dad, etc. The only character you can remember the name of is the one we‚Äôre not allowed to say. 

I know Encanto is a strictly Disney Film and not a Disney Pixar film like Coco, but Coco is far superior  (faaaaaaarrrrrrrrr superior) when it comes to a movie about Latin America, the people who live there, and the importance of family. The plot isn‚Äôt muddled and anti-climactic, the music actually feels like it belongs in the movie, and there‚Äôs still a large cast of characters, but they‚Äôre handled appropriately: you can remember the names of all the characters important to driving the plot, and the rest of the cast is mostly there for support, comic levity, and variety of voices delivering incidental lines.

While they use a formula that is essentially ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%)... how those things play into the rankings today is far different than 2013.

Frozen came out November 27, 2013, hit digital downloads on February 25, 2014 after 90 days. Then it didn't hit DVD/Blu-ray on March 18, 2014 after 111 days.  It set all types of sales/download records for Disney, and then it was the week of the physical release that Let It Go hit the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 100.

Meanwhile, Encanto had 1 month between Theatrical and Streaming from November 24th to December 24th, so everything was much more accelerated. Hitting both Thanksgiving and Christmas for releases.  So when you look at Encanto hitting all three metrics of Sales/Airplay/Streaming, it was able to do that all at once because the releases were so close together.  We Don't Talk About Bruno hit #1 the week of January 31st, so about a two months after release when it was incredibly accessible to everyone.  Even my kid can just say ""Alexa, play we don't talk about Bruno"" and get it to play.  We didn't have smart speakers in the house back then that could do that.   

The success of Frozen and Encanto is crazy, but I don't think it was an even playing field for both because of the accelerated releases due to Covid, Encanto coming to streaming within a month of theatrical release, and streaming music services just being much more popular these days making the music more accessible.  

Like think about when A Whole New World hit #1.  That was an era where if you wanted to listen to the soundtrack the parents had to physically buy the movie or the Tape/CD.  Now the power to stream is more in the hands of the children, and they can pick up their tablet and just watch it on Disney Plus or tell their smart speaker to play it.  When Frozen came out, it was digital, but still in the digital marketplaces where parents had to buy it.",1647300978.0,25

I am reminded of a lecture I sat in on around 25 years ago at college where the guest lecturer made the case that certain media segments correlated in incidents of criminal activity. Her examples were, an episode of Donahue where they had a high school boy on who was assaulted by members of his athletic team using a broom handle directly correlated with incidents of police assaulting suspects with broom and plunger handles. She talked about the made for TV movie, The Burning Bed, and  John Bobbitt getting his penis cut off correlating with increases in incidents of spouse on spouse murder that was usually linked to retaliation for spousal abuse. 

Her argument was that it might be helpful to not have explainers about how a crime played out as it could serve as a how to for future sociopaths. On the Donahue show, Phil Donahue had the boy reinact his assault on the stage down to asking where the bullies were holding onto him when they attacked him. In The Burning Bed example, there were simply not enough information about how to safely exit an abusive relationship without resorting to lethal violence. 

I can see how something like seeing success narratives play out on TV would convince people that they are not working hard enough to achieve their goals. 

Challenging these tropes gets you accusations of censorship or trying to ruin fun. We're not trying to ban anything. We are just challenging the fundamental narratives that are ubiquitous on TV and their cumulative harm on the public. 

I mean, just imagine the number of characters you have seen on American TV shows, from Phillis on Mary Tyler Moore to Topanga on Boy Meets World, who are vegetarians and health conscious feeing their friends bad health food.

>Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property. ""I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew‚Äîat least they claimed to be Communists‚Äîcouldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic.

EDIT:

See the link. Its not a small difference.

I'll also add that your health system is a huge hindrance to mobility. In europe, if you decide to open a little business, or risk a different job, you are NOT afraid you or your family will lose healthcare. You can take some risks because society is not as harsh.

In the states its a far greater risk. From a spot of bad luck to being crippled and homeless is much easier and faster.

>An enormous number of Americans have been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than, say, Germans or Danes precisely because they possess far fewer freedoms in the concrete. They are far more vulnerable to medical and financial crisis, far more likely to receive inadequate health coverage, far more prone to irreparable insolvency, far more unprotected against predatory creditors, far more subject to income inequality, and so forth, while effectively paying more in tax (when one figures in federal, state, local, and sales taxes, and then compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country, as almost nowhere else, their taxes do not cover). One might think that a people who once rebelled against the mightiest empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services. But we accept what we have become used to, I suppose. Even so, one has to ask, what state apparatus in the ‚Äúfree‚Äù world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens while providing no substantial civic benefits in return, solely in order to enrich a piratically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the immensely wealthy?

Poor people have to spend all their labour to get money (and there's only so much time in the day and energy in the body to do it), and spend the money they get on living expenses so its harder to save. Most investments have timelines before they make back what they cost in fees, and poor people can't float that long. They also have to pay more in interest on money they borrow, either because they don't have enough capital for lenders to consider them safe, or because the only lenders who will lend to them are exploitative. They're also more likely to suffer fees for missed repayments or low balances in their accounts. The stuff they buy needs to be cheaper which means it often wears out or wastes faster than higher quality expensive products the wealthy can buy.

Wealthy people can afford to tie their money up in investments because they don't need quick access to funds, they can make money without spending labour by earning returns on their capital and there's no upward limit on that like there is on working hours - the more money they have, the more their returns. The cost of borrowing for wealthy people is lower.

Those all compound so that value accrues to the wealthy far moreso than to the poor.

That's a rather odd study. Very odd, actually.

First, it only compares income for MEN and their SONS - excluding all women from the data set for some reason, despite all of the countries involved having modern gender equality policies and extensive female participation in the workforce. This is bizarre.

Second, the United States is compared only to Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK - no other countries are included. All of those nations combined have less than a third of the population of the United States (and the UK accounts for 2/3 of that). Four of the five countries are smaller than major American cities. The article seems to deliberately ignore the existence of numerous large and populous nations, and selects only four tiny Scandinavian countries plus the UK as the reference points for economic mobility.

No rationale is given to support the selection of these particular countries as the standards of reference, despite the existence of numerous other nations with larger populations, land areas, and economies more comparable to the United States. Why not Germany, France, Italy, or Spain? For that matter, why not Taiwan, India, or Japan? All of them are much larger than the cherry-picked Scandinavian nations inexplicably selected for this article.

The entire reason a rags to riches story is interesting is because the scenario is so exceptional and unlikely.

And even saying that, many people would take that as an argument against the potential for anyone to make it when facing such challenges and it isn't. The fact is when the odds are stacked against you, the chances of you succeeding are less. That's not controversial or anti-American - its' common sense and logic.

You can do things to even the odds - like work harder and persevere, but depending on the number of variables involved and the odds that are stacked against you, this is likely only going to contribute so much to your overall chances.

For example, someone who is somewhat naturally intelligent and works extremely hard in the face of overwhelming odds is probably more likely to overcome these challenges than someone who works hard but doesn't focus their attention on the most apt problems or objectives. And even the idea of natural intelligence isn't super reliable. Rather this is to suggest one variable among many that might slightly decrease the odds of failure.

So you end up with Americans - both from the right and the left of the political spectrum - thinking that socialism is ""free"" healthcare and education. Which creates a whole lot of problems for any policies pushing for those important causes to ever happen. And access to education and health are crucial for any country, less excusable for a modern ""rich"" country.

The left will talk about wanting socialism and at times will praise self-proclaimed socialist/communist countries (dictatorships) and promote their propaganda (Cuba, Venezuela, etc) and the right will talk about how they don't want to end up with socialism ""like Cuba or Venezuela, etc"".

The Nordic Model is not equal to socialism and hasn't made those countries socialist in Europe. Over time, any socialist model in the real world (outside ""1st world"" classrooms), including Europe, have end up in failure as well. Socialism does end up blending the lines between different socio-economic status levels, destroying middle class and making people similarly poor for the most part.",1647313606.0,4

For others, making minimum wage at Walmart is the same ""class"" as a tradesman, or even a doctor, and thus moving from one income level to another is not upward mobility... that upward mobility can only be acheived if one earns enough wealth to not have to work, or if one goes from not having to work to their children not having to work, nor their children's children.

I've got a friend, initials DID, who grew up in a trailer park to first gen Trinidadian immigrant parents who speak with heavy accents, so zero privilege. In 5th grade, DID's teacher thinks he's pretty smart and he should do an international baccalaureate (IB) preparedness program at a magnet middle school (harder middle school classes to prepare for harder high school classes). DID convinced his parents to sign the forms, which they only do because the school is a magnet program so he'll be added to a bus route and they won't have to take him to the miles further away middle school.  
  
During 8th grade, DID does all the paperwork himself to get into magnet high school with the IB program. DID excels in the IB program and gets into the nearby state university (now a top 10 public university) on a variety of scholarships and grants, which he researched and applied for all by himself. Never received any financial help from any family members.  
  
At the University, DID meets eventual wife, who is premed. Travels around the country with her for med school and residency. Works at several advertising firms along the way. After residency, moves to Jacksonville, FL where wife takes job at one of the hospitals and DID founds his own online advertising firm. Now DID makes like $300k/year and his Dr wife makes more and they live in a huge house like 6 blocks from the beach.  
  
That covers the work ethic and up by his bootstraps point. Now the natural intelligence.  
  
DID has 4 siblings. They're all short sighted, immediate gratitude, poor decision making, in their 40s and still working menial jobs BUT as far as I know (known DID since 6th grade) not on drugs or with criminal records (so it isn't like they got into the system early and had additional barriers). The only one who doesn't live in a trailer park near the parents, check to check, is one sister who married her HS boyfriend who eventually became a Ford dealership manager after working there like 20 years and lives a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  
  
Those 5 people grew up in the same home, all born in the USA, none had noticeable accents, and all went to the same schools outside of DID choosing basically on his own to go to the two magnet programs. All of his siblings suffer from dumb people issues like lack of logic and inability to prepare for the future. The only explanation is DID being naturally smarter than his siblings.",1647305935.0,1

Your critique is already accounted for. 

Similar story for education. Let's say you have the ""typical"" debt associated with a bachelor's degree of $30,000. That's about 1.5% of lifetime earnings. Student loan payments are about $300/month for around 10 years. It does get worse if you have a graduate degree (debt there tends to be far higher and interest rates are as well), though the overwhelming majority of people in this group are doing alright. 



There are legitimate criticisms of the US though. If you're unemployed, life can suck. There's not much of a safety net for that group.

I want to emphasize, it absolutely SUCKS to be in the bottom 5% in the US compared to say Germany or Norway or Luxembourg. Being in the 10th percentile in the US is similar to the UK, France and Germany though. It really is everyone but the chronically unemployed that do well in the US.

Most of the people screaming ""Europeans have a stronger middle class"" base it on inequality measures and not as much on income thresholds. Holding every western country to the same, HIGHER standards used in the US makes just about every country not named Norway(1/2 the population size of Los Angeles county) or Luxembourg (~9x smaller than Norway) look worse. You can also compare those tiny countries to US states that are relatively rich (e.g. Massachusetts and Maryland).",1647299787.0,35

And regarding the population of Scandinavian countries, the issue has nothing to do with sample size in a statistical sense. Of course the sample size is statistically large enough. The problem is twofold: First, the size and population of a country greatly influence the nature of its internal politics and administrative policies. The Scandinavian countries are not even federations of quasi-sovereign states the way the US and UK are - and even the UK barely scratches the surface of America's inter-state political complexity.

Second, four of the five countries selected for comparison are right next to each other and share a very uniform set of political values and administrative policies. They are far less disparate from one another than they are from the many other nations which were left out of the study. This is not a comparison between the US and the world; it's between the US and Scandinavia, with a dash of UK thrown in for good measure.

It's based on how risky it is to invest, start a business, try something new. It's based on having healthy citizens that don't work 80 hour weeks and can afford to fail without facing homelessness and poverty.

Let's imagine a few scenarios.

Bill is American, Erik is Scandanavian.

They both have an idea for a business venture and both invest their savings into it. During the first year of the business, neither party can afford health insurance for themselves/ family. During this year, both men and their wives have a bad car accident, both are badly injured and will take 6 months to recover well enough to attend work/run their business.

Bill receives a pile of medical bills in the mail for 10s of thousands of dollars (possibly even more).

Erik receives no hospital bills due to public healthcare.

Bill and his wife receive little to no social security to pay their bills, rent, food etc. Face imminent bankruptcy, potential homelessness, closure of business.

Erik and his wife receive  significant social security payments which help keep them afloat, housed and fed whilst they recover.

In 6 months time Bill's business has failed, and he may have ruined his family's life and future prosperity by taking the risk in the first place. He and his family may even be homeless.

Erik is able to pick up where he left off with his business 6 months later and watch it grow. Increasing his family's prosperity and enjoying upward mobility.



Let's rewind back and imagine the same scenario, but Bill and Erik are already quite wealthy when the game starts.

Bill can afford healthcare as well as start a business.
When he is injured, he can use his wealth to pay his bills, his rent and feed his family while he recovers.

Erik's situation doesn't really change much by already being wealthy.

Both men succeed in their business/ have the capital and security to try again if they fail

Once upon a time, there was a house at the end of an otherwise empty street. In it lived a bunch of kids. Some of the kids were a little older than the others, and they'd tell the young ones about how the owners were coming home soon and they'd fix all of the problems. 

Days passed and parts of the house started falling apart. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be here soon. They'll fix it."" More days passed and some of the kids started getting in heated arguments with others. ""Don't worry,"" said the older kids. ""The owners will be home soon. They'll make everyone get along.""

More days passed and the house fell into worse shape, and the arguments got more heated. Some rooms had to be blocked off because they were now unsafe. Some rooms were avoided by most because of the vicious fights that broke out there. ""Don't worry,"" the older kids said, trying not to look worried themselves, ""The owners *have* to be coming soon to fix all of this.""

And, in that moment, one of the younger kids had a terrible thought. During the past few days, they'd realized that none of the older kids had actually met the owners themselves. What if the owners weren't actually coming back? Or worse yet: what if they were all waiting for someone who didn't actually exist to fix very real and very pressing problems?

If I espouse propaganda and you repeat it because it convinces you, are not espousing propaganda despite your better intentions to act reasonably?

The American idea of rugged individualism and the American dream are exactly that, American. It has its roots in Manifest Destiny and Western expansion and was catapulted into the mainstream after the post WW2 economic boom. The idea of a prosperous America, where any man (historically speaking) could make something of themselves is part of its nationality identity. But with that said, it's not something that 'just happens.' 

Now, whether it was a moralistic argument during the Great Depression or a media export in the fight against global Communism post WW2, these ideologies were either revived or persisted through time. I'm sure over time X number of people truly believed and perpetuated this American mythology. I'm also sure that's exacerbated by successful individuals having the capacity to evangelize their 'self-made' success. But I'm also sure that in this complex system, where our government and economics depend on the ideal of ""an American Dream"" there is intentional propagation. 

This is the murky water of propaganda. When it's good, people not only believe it, they spread it. But they can also wash their hands of its consequences, rationalizing it and supporting it. It's conjecture, but I don't understand how we can say in good faith that these ideas are not promoted? 

It's anecdotal so you don't have to take it seriously, but I work with startups and the entire VC ecosystem (and some smaller corners of tech) are built on selling you the idea that *you* can start your own business or startup... they know most people will fail, but I know for a fact they foster that belief because they directly benefit it from it. 

I would be hard pressed to believe that other large institutions benefit from this. 200k tuition for universities? Credit cards selling you the idea of endless abundance and ""ways to get ahead""? At some point, whether the ideas were naturally developed or not, there are so many institutions that profit off of the American Dream and helping you ""get there"" that it would be stupid not to promote it?

TLDR: Even if no one is in the room dictating the belief, the influence of propaganda allows it to perpetuate. Even if you support propaganda out of good faith, it's still propaganda.",1647305783.0,7

The process is called 'priming.' People are more likely to pick something they feel they are familiar with even if they don't remember how or why they became familiar with it in the first place. It also plays off frequency bias. People are more likely to accept an opinion if they feel they have seen it multiple times. They don't necessarily remember if the opinion was from people they trust or if it was repeated by a bunch of strangers online. It works both ways there. If they repeatedly see a negative opinion of something they will adopt that opinion without any personal reason why. Again that's part of the reason for saturation advertising. An ad is a positive message. If a person hears one bad thing about your company but a dozen good ones from your messaging, their overall opinion is bound to remain high.

The other study sucked, for obvious reasons which I explained at length. It's not my fault that the first study was so poorly done, nor that the second study is over two decades old. That's historical data at this point, not a current representation of either the US or Germany's status in 2022.

This last article you linked to (Stockhausen) is the only decent one among the three. It seems to analyze relevant data, although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really).

Oddly, the abstract claims that, ""while the majority of German males has been able to share in the country‚Äôs rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground."" However, this is directly contradicted by the results themselves, which clearly indicate that well over half of American men earn more than their fathers. The majority of both American and German men are doing better than their fathers.

 Notably, this study does not evaluate the amount of improvement per individual (i.e. only the number of people who earn more, not how much more they earn), nor does it address the downward mobility included in the original study which started this thread.

Combined with some of the things they *did* mention, like free education, health care and parental leave, it becomes *much* easier to re-train, re-educate or simply re-align your career and lifestyle.

It didn‚Äôt. Your reasons were bad.

Income mobility is, by definition, a measure of parent to child. It must, therefore, span many decades. Generally at least 5 decades, often 6- enough time for the parents earnings to be captured over time, to start. Then for the child to become an adult, and then that adult child to now have a long period of adult earnings to be averaged over time and compared to the averaged over time earnings of the parent.

And it must have good data about both parent, and child, and they must be comparable.

Can you think of Any reason, any at all, why they would predominant use the data of fathers‚Ä¶ from 50-60 years ago?

And not mothers? In the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs? Any reason at all that data about women‚Äôs the earnings, in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, might not be great for analysis of societal income mobility?


>nor that the second study is over two decades old. 

Again, these studies must, by definition, span close to half a century. There is no evidence that these types of massive country level trends change quickly.

>although it remains odd that only males are included (quite alarming, really). 

Does it?

Really?

Give this a good think.

>The results support a conclusion that 67% of German men earn more than their fathers, while 60% of American men do. That's a relative difference of 11.7% in generational income improvement. 

That‚Äôs a huge difference.

That also means 40% earn less. Vs 33%.

Swinging 7% of the population from going down to going up means that the amount of income from that 7% is ripped from the hands of the Very top tiers- it can come from nowhere else- and redistributed to the working class.

That‚Äôs an enormous amount of overall income / GDP that is more evenly distributed to citizens.

Exposure to even moderate ambient lighting during nighttime sleep, compared to sleeping in a dimly lit room, harms your cardiovascular function during sleep and increases your insulin resistance the following morning, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.

‚ÄúThe results from this study demonstrate that just a single night of exposure to moderate room lighting during sleep can impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation, which are risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome,‚Äù said senior study author Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for people to avoid or minimize the amount of light exposure during sleep.‚Äù

There is already evidence that light exposure during daytime increases heart rate via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which kicks your heart into high gear and heightens alertness to meet the challenges of the day. 

‚ÄúOur results indicate that a similar effect is also present when exposure to light occurs during nighttime sleep,‚Äù Zee said.

Anti-aircraft missiles come in 3 types - Radar on missile, Seeker on missile, and a combo of the two.

Radar on Missile means the launcher can stand alone and track the aircraft.  When fired, the missile radar follows the aircraft and works out an intercept course to kill it.  It also means the missiles radar beams can be ""heard"" by the targeted aircraft, and others nearby.

Seeker on Missile means it needs a ground search/target radar to detect and illuminate the target aircraft.  Think of a searchlight finding a balloon at night, and the missile follows that reflected light to the target.  This means the missile can't be ""heard"" by the target aircraft, but the search and tracking radar beams (they're different because reasons) can be detected.

They combo types of missile systems allow for complex targeting options.  The search radar finds a target, the targeting radar illuminates the target, but only long enough for the missile to fire and lock on.  Then the radar site goes silent while the flying missile seeks the target on it's own.  It may turn on again when the missile is close to the target to provide a strong signal to overpower jamming.

Now the Wild Weasel part.

Because two of the three missile types use a ground based radar to get started, if you detect and kill that radar site, the entire missile battery of 3-6 launchers (some up to six missiles at each launcher) is now blind, so effectively dead.   It's can't see, so it can't shoot.

The Weasels would bait the battery control radar operators to light them up, revealing their surface location.  The Weasels could turn, aim, and fire in well under a minute. This would be as fast or faster (one hoped) than it took the ground control to calculate and aim the missile. In the next minute, if the battery had launched, the targeting radar would get killed about the time the flying missile would get close to the plane.   Dead radar, no guide beam to follow, no more threat.   And if it had it's own targeting radar, then other systems on board the Weasel could blind or spoof it now that the surface site is dead.

These can be steered so that you can search for targets at all times or halted to focus on one key area. They are more expensive but also better as a result.

The US method is better at finding targets because it is like using a search light vs the Russian method of using a flash light.

In addition, there are numerous techniques to hide yourself until the last minute. A prime example would be using US AWACS to find the target, ignore it until it already passes the launcher, and then have the launcher pop online just long enough to fire and hit the target. 

The point of the F-35 is to partially allow stuff like this.

 ""Bob Hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station in Anaheim, providing they have a camera there and three people. He'll go to the opening of a market to receive an award. He'd get an award from Thom McCan for wearing their shoes. It's pathetic. It's a bottomless pit. A barrel that has no floor. He must be a man who has an ever-crumbling estimation of himself. He's constantly filling himself up. He's like a junkie ‚Äì an applause junkie. What happens to those people when they can't get up and do their shtick, God only knows. Bob Hope, Christ, instead of growing old gracefully or doing something with his money, be helpful, all he does is he has an anniversary with the President looking on. It's sad. He gets on an airplane every two minutes always going someplace. It didn't bother him at all to work the Vietnam War. Oh, he took that in his stride. He did his World War II and Korean War act. ""Our boys"" and all that. He‚Äôs a pathetic guy.‚Äú",1647306298.0,7

The entire premise of what you are trying to say is completely incorrect. The rise of Boomer's also coincides with the rise of the counterculture and the backlash against conservative figures. Boomers are the reason why art from the mid 60s to early 70s is still held in such high regard, because things that were more risky and broke social conventions were particularly marketable and popular amongst young people. 

Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, John Wayne and so on are all figures that are really held up by the generation before. I know you said (when boomers were growing up) but Boomer culture hadn't come into it's own at this point and these figures weren't being marketed towards boomers, so they weren't for boomers.

I might point you towards the biggest figures amongst Boomers who were absolutely not fascist pricks and are still some of the most respected figures in all of art/society. Bob Dylan, McCartney, Lennon, Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Jim Morrison are really their most famous musicians and very much not fascists. Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood (yeah I know but he's a moderate Republican), Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep and so on are amongst the most popular actors amongst Boomers, and very much not fascist. The big sporting figures, Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Willie Mays, Bill Russell, very much not fascists. 

I'm Gen Z, but the point you are trying to say is literally the opposite of reality. These actors weren't most popular with boomers, and there is a line in history (somewhere between 63-65) where Western media diverges from the more traditional conservative sort of things and pushes in the opposite direction to attract boomers, and it's very obvious looking at the changes in fashion, music, the way people talked, spiritual and political beliefs and that sort of thing. It's fucken stupid how boomers get characterised as a conservative generation when their youth was far more extreme than the youth of today. Mainstream music, film and magazines are a lot more mainstream and less experimental, fashion is a lot plainer and more conservative in some ways and celebrities now are a lot, lot more commercial and conservative than the ones that the boomers idolised.",1647331624.0,1

He became legendary as Razor Ramon in WWF and continued to be successful in WCW as a founding member of the NWO.

But then after his life started to spiral out of control. He was known for showing up completely wasted an indie shows. Pretty much every wrestling fan considered him a lost cause.

But somehow, with the help of fellow legend Diamond Dallas Page, Hall was able to turn his life around and finally gave us insight into how great of a mind he had for wrestling. I always wished to see his return as a manager or trainer. So sad to see him go; wish he‚Äôd been around more but he could‚Äôve left us much earlier.

For those not familiar, Hall was a part of a group called The Kliq. They looked out for each other behind the scenes in wrestling and remained good friends despite being in different companies.

There's good and bad about The Kliq's behind-the-curtain politics and roles, no question about that, but Hall used his spot to help get younger wrestlers over. He'd give them chances to pull good moves, took loses when it mattered more to them and knew how keep himself strong in defeat (which made the victor look even better). And the dude knew how much he meant to fans, young and old.

There's a clip on the subreddit Squaredcircle where Hall was on Jerry Springer (before it went full crash TV) on an episode about kids going through tough times. One of these kids had HIV (I think), so Hall came out as a guest to cheer him up in full Razor Ramon gear. He was the Intercontinental Champ at the time and he just gave the belt to the kid. It was the real belt Hall had to use as champ, not a replica.


So after the show, Hall had to tell Vince McMahon they needed a new belt. This is an expensive thing and kayfabe was still strong, so Vince blew his top about it. Then Hall explained why and Vince just calms down and simply says ""Guess we need a new belt.""

He had been banging through the concrete for 10 hours before the cops came and figured it all out (its a long story, I can tell if you want the full breakdown of that wild ass day). He intended on killing us when he broke through.

For a whole year after, at our next apartment, every time my upstairs neighbor got delivery (which was almost every weekend) and they knocked, it sounded like the banging of the crazy guy trying to get in to kill us. I jumped every single time and had to calm myself down.

But more traumatic than that was when I spent 6 hours sitting by the door with a shotgun, waiting for my husband to get back from the cops/courthouse, waiting for the crazy dude (who hadn't been arrested and in our state, couldn't be yet) to realize the 1.5 inch plywood door was easier to break through than the concrete. And realizing that if he came through that door (or ceiling), that I was going to shoot him dead. That knowledge, that I would take someone else's life, even in self defense, has permanently fucked up my mind. I thought I was a pacifist. I never knew how I would feel or what decisions I would make until I was in that situation. But now I know and I can't unknow it anymore.

There was a study I came across before that showed people who got into a car accident and kill someone were more likely to suffer PTSD if it was random and uncontrollable than if they were responsible and to blame for the accident.

When someone at fault, they're able to rationalize the action and create a narrative that allows them to move on. Either I shouldn't have run the right, or been on the phone, or drinking. There's an action to take responsibility for and a correction to make. That makes it easier to heal

But if the accident was random. There's nothing to rationalize. A person jumping out, a car swerving. When it's out of they're control there is nothing that can be said and the random acts resulting in death can be harder to move on from. The only narrative is it could have been anyone, or I could have been the one to die.

I'm a bit of a rambler but I'll do my best to keep it concise, but there was a lot going on all at once. 

I had moved in with my then boyfriend of two years (now husband) and our roommate (best friend of husband, close friend of mine). We lived in a 340 sqft studio apartment (yes, that's a really small apartment for three people! It was supposed to be temporary while we looked for a 2 bedroom apartment) in one of those old apartments where they just stacked some studios on top of each other in concrete squares. We lived in the biggest city in the state and studios were the cheapest living, especially split three ways. It was the kind of place where when we heard scratches in the walls, we just assumed rats because well, its a shitty old apartment. 

On February 17th, we were woken up to a knocking sound coming from upstairs, like someone was aggressively putting together IKEA furniture. It woke my boyfriend and I up, and I just covered my head with my pillow. We had heard noises late at night from him so we just always assumed he worked night shift. Well this night, the banging noises didn't stop, and went on throughout the day until 1PM. 

At 8AM, my boyfriend got out of bed, and went to work. Our upstairs neighbor ran down the stairs, chased him into the parking lot and said ""If I ever catch you in my apartment again, I'll fucking kill you!""

Having never BEEN in this man's apartment, my boyfriend was confused, said ""Okay man"" and got in his car and started driving to work. He called me on the way and told me to make sure the deadbolt was locked. I did and told him to call the non emergency line (Note: At this time, we just thought this dude was victim of a break in and thought my boyfriend was part of it, we had no idea what was going on here). So he called them, they said they'd send someone over and to be home by 2 so we could give our statement. 

The roommate and I go about our day, listening to the banging, semi worried, mostly focused on applying for jobs (both of us recently unemployed). I'm more concerned than our roommate, but just waited for the cop to get here. 

Boyfriend comes back at noon, the banging stops at 1PM, at 2PM a cop comes over. She comes in, listens to our side of things (""We dont know this dude"",""weird noises last night"" ""threatened to kill me if i ever went into his apartment, I've never been in there"",etc), and goes up to talk to the neighbor. 

40 minutes go by. We can hear them through the floor, which really should have been a clue that the floor's structural integrity wasn't how it used to be. 

After 40 minutes, she comes back down and knocks on our door. We open the door for her, and she comes back in, turns around and deadbolts the door immediately. I'll never forget how she turned back to us and said ""Holy shit guys, its so much worse than we thought."" because that was the LAST thing I'd ever want a cop to say. I remember I burst out laughing. At the time life had been really rough on me and this just felt like a kick to the nuts. Of course it was worse than we thought. 

So I can't remember everything, there was a lot, but basically she went up there and this guy had FIVE locks on his door, that he himself had installed. He was VERY excited that a cop had ""finally"" come to help him. He claimed several things, but the ones that I can remember were that we had been floating (yes, floating) through the ceiling, whispering to him about how we would ""get"" him, how no one would ever believe him, how they'd never find his body, he claimed we had been sexually assaulting him every night, we've been spying on him and had put cameras in his apartment, he just couldn't find them because they were imperceivably small. How'd we get them in there? Well when we floated in there. Also that we had stolen his watch, his belt and had been drinking the milk from his fridge. 

So that knocking noise we had been hearing, from 3:30AM to about 1PM - well apparently he had decided he had had enough and ripped up all the carpet in the apartment and began digging a hole into his floor/our ceiling, to ""take care of the three punks downstairs"" and if the cops didn't do something about it, ""\[he\] would do what he needed to do, they needed to be stopped"" - based on his threat to my boyfriend, we took this to mean he planned on killing all of us. 

Oh, and what we thought were rats? Yeah turns out that he wanted to counter spy on us and had bought cameras and had been pushing them down the vents to try and spy on us. The  vents were in the bathrooms. I try not to think about it too much cuz the idea that this guy had footage of my 11PM shits and shower snot rockets (and you know, my naked body) is too creepy. The cop said the cameras he got weren't good quality nor were they hooked up to any sort of device that could save all the footage but still.

Not sure if this psychologically makes a difference. But I've read that snipers often go through a lot of mental stress because they're ""closer"" to the enemy than other soldiers.

I'm slightly shaking, partially out of terror but mostly from rage. Thankfully the cop is trained in mental health crisis, but this is a doozy even for her. She said the creepiet thing is the man APPEARED sound of mind. If it wasn't for the five locks on the door and  talking about us floating through the floor, he didn't come off like a lunatic. He had a job. He had no record (she checked) of mental health or criminal issues, though he did come from out of state, so we dont really know his background. 

  
So she tells us the game plan. In our state, if she admitted him involuntarily today, they would have to take his accusations seriously. He apparently wanted a rape kit done on him. If they did that, we would be continually exposed to this guy, and the cop could tell we were just knocked out of left field by this. It'd be months or YEARS of this following us around. So instead, she told us she would tell our apartment we needed to break lease and emergency vacate the apartment (the apartment had been notified at this point that this dude had ripped up the carpet and several light fixtures). Due to tennant laws in our state, they couldn't evict him immediately, but she could get us away from him immediately and she knew if we stayed he would eventually attack us. So what we had to do was vacate the apartment and get a restraining order. Because my boyfriend was technically the only one on the lease, he had to go get the restraining order. So he had to leave, and the cop had to leave to go with him and report to the judge.  She said she had called backup, but because this guy hadn't even technically gotten in, we had to wait for some cops to get done with other calls and get to us. The reason this needed to happen this way and with this timeline, was because if we got a restraining order first, and THEN he was admitted after we left the apartment, when they admitted him and he said ""my downstairs neighbors were r\*ping me"" the cop could say ""He doesn't have downstairs neighbors and the ones he did have have a restraining order against him"". It was the best way to protect us from dealing with it for years. But it meant leaving me and my roommate alone in the apartment. 

Before she left with my boyfriend to get the restraining order (This took a total of SIX HOURS because at this point it was 4PM on a Friday and the judge supposed to take care of our district had already left by the time they got to the courthouse. The whole time my boyfriends phone was dying so I had no clue when he'd get back) she asked if we had a gun on hand. We said yes - my boyfriends shotgun. She asked if I or the roommate knew how to use it, I said I did. In fact a month ago I had learned from a friend in the coast guard how to combat load it. She told me to keep it on hand but out of reach from the door. She had lied to the neighbor upstairs and claimed to be taking my boyfriend in for questioning, but had no clue if he would stay in his apartment like ordered. Not that that was safe either as he had already decided tunneling to us was a solution to his problems. 

I knew we were in a bad situation because the cop seemed so upset because she couldn't keep us safe. We were in a hard situation. Everyone involved in this was in a difficult situation, even mr crazypants upstairs. 

So that's how I sat, holding a shotgun in my lap for about six hours, next to my roommate, waiting for the crazy person upstairs to realize a door was much thinner and easier to get through than a floor-ceiling. And realized in that moment that if he came through the door, I was going to pull that trigger. That was honestly more traumatizing than realizing someone wanted to kill me - realizing that I was willing to kill them back. I think about that moment a lot, especially around the anniversary. It makes me feel cold in my soul. It takes something different inside someone to take a life, even in self defense, and you don't know its inside you until you're there. I haven't been able to watch the Life of Pi since, because I know what its like, having that Tiger on the boat (assuming you subscribe to that metaphorical interpretation). It's been five years and I still feel weird about that knowledge of myself now. 

To sum up the ending of a very, very long story, after six hours my boyfriend got the restraining order and the cops escorted us out of the apartment. We had just our backpacks, my medications, and the shotgun. We slept on several friends couches for two weeks while we tried to find a new apartment (and we did, eventually going back for our stuff). The first night I didn't sleep at all, just laid down next to my friends two puppies petting them, listening to my roommate and boyfriend snore. Last I had heard they were admitting mr crazy pants to a psychiatric hospital. That was five years ago and to be honest, I didn't really care to pursue it and just wanted as far away from it as possible.

I've now married said boyfriend and still am great friends with the roommate (who now has a girlfriend himself and god they're so cute together). Hilariously the \*NEXT\* upstairs neighbor (the one that ordered takeout every weekend and scared me haha) ended up being a therapist and helped me find a good one. I'm also god-mom to his dogs and he ended up playing Led Zeplin as I walked down the aisle at my wedding. So not all my neighbors have been bad lol

I just wanted to end by saying, I do not feel hatred towards the neighbor. I mostly feel pity. He thought we were torturing him, and if someone had been floating up and sexually assaulting me, I probably also would want to kill them. However I also do not feel guilt about holding a shotgun ready to shoot him, and I would not have felt guilty about shooting him if I had to. He was the one threatening to kill us after all and I'm sure if he had managed to kill my husband I probably WOULD hate him. I still cannot put into words how I exactly feel about it. My hope is he got help, somehow, and never put anyone else in danger. 

Hope you enjoyed the ride. I keep telling myself I'll put it on youtube but never get around to it lol",1647304309.0,10
