735,funny,Dolphin trolls a seagull!,Ltcommander83,1647353576.0,841,55092,0.94,"The two instances of dolphin intelligence that stuck with me the most:

1) [The Dolphin fishermen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwWfYLKFw0) in Brazil. Basically *the dolphins* figured out they can catch more fish if they work with us, so they purposefully chase schools of fish into our nets. This plan was concocted by the dolphins, ***NOT*** by the local fishermen, and the dolphins call the shots for all the fishing jobs. They signal, they choose where to fish, they choose when to fish, they're clearly in charge and the brains of the operation. All we did was recognize the value and play along.

2) Wish I had kept the vid of this but didn't wanna watch it again when I first found it: it was in Japan. A bunch of fishermen cornered a dolphin in a cove (is that the right word? Rock formation along the coast where you could block off one part and trap anything in the water) and it being Japan, of course the goal was to catch it and eat it. The dolphin was distressed and trying to escape, but couldn't. The dolphin's last ditch escape attempt...? It lept out of the water and onto the rocks, leaping towards one white, blonde tourist duo in a group of otherwise japanese fishermen. It was like the dolphin could recognize the dangerous ones and the *only* duo present that might help the dolphin, so the dolphin lept to them for help. That was....painful to watch. Whether the dolphin could recognize the difference due to the languages being spoken, the different physical features, the clothing or what have you...it doesn't matter. If they're smart enough to recognize such a difference and use that to make a logical conclusion, then we probably have no business killing and eating the damned things.",1647366909.0,1

The Vancouver aquarium would certainly have tried to get her a new companion, but the park board that owns the land there has made it illegal to keep cetaceans in captivity. Their motive was good, to prevent any more animals from being taken from the wild or being bred in captivity, but they didn't make any exceptions for rehab cases that can't be released.

The Vancouver Aquarium is looking to transfer Helen to another aquarium, but it's been hard to find a good fit for an injured dolphin.

The stupid things done in the name of animal welfare in Vancouver...

Several years ago the aquarium also had a family of Belugas. All of a sudden the last two belugas just up and died. The aquarium said that they'd likely consumed something bad.

Now why after decades of good care would two belugas just all of a sudden eat something that lead to their deaths? They couldn't prove it, but I'm convinced that some PETA nutjob or similar, snuck in and fed the belugas poisoned fish or something.",1647374289.0,16

So for example, my comic gets somewhere between 50-70k pageviews per month, which gets me maybe $40 in ad share, plus $100 from the rewards program.

Add Patreon to that, and we're making maybe $300/month, for ~30ish hours of work. At their core, web comics aren't really the sort of thing that is going to make you a decent income as you work on it - rather, it's more about hitting a critical mass at which point the labour remains the same, but the number of views it garners grows many times higher.

The flipside would be to host your own website with its own ads (which we certainly do as well) - those will pay a lot better than the 50% cut WebToon gives you, but now you also have to drive traffic to your comic yourself, and it ends up being far less for far more work, than WebToon can provide.

Usually this means ""removing"" them to other places out of sight. An actual realworld example of this would be places bussing homeless to other places. Another might be criminalizing common homeless behavior in order to arrest them. This ""cleans up"" the homelessness insofar as it is no longer seen in that area.

The liberal approach might be to offer aid in various ways. Housing, rehab, monetary support, mental healthcare, etc. A real-world example might be homeless shelters which attempt to rehabilitate homeless in order to make them ""function"" and therefore attain a home. Another might be programs to help homeless veterans with mental/physical health.

Sometimes the liberal approach runs into issues where the liberal opinion (""provide support"") hits a conservative one: we want to help them, but not here, help them *anywhere else*. So, it's a complex subject.",1647381727.0,103

It was about how the American Medical Association put out a guide to ""inclusive language"" for doctors and other healthcare workers.

For example, it recommends avoiding the term ""vulnerable"" to describe a group at-risk for a disease and to instead use ""oppressed"" even though that makes no sense in many contexts.

And it advocated avoiding the term ""combat"" (as in ""combat disease"") because of ""violent connotations.""

The NYT article made the very good point that the language guide claims to advance ""equity"" yet makes no mention of universal healthcare, which the AMA opposes, or abortion rights.

I think financial issues are often a combination of bad decisions and circumstances you may not have control over but people tend to want to see it as one or the other. I’m also very left leaning and the amount of student loans I saw on those reports were insane. Like $100k in private school loans for a liberal arts degree. I also have a liberal art degree but did community college and state college. I do think we need a reasonable student loan forgiveness but I can’t get behind tax payers paying off student debt for insane amounts because you wanted a fun college experience and think you’re too good for community and public colleges.

It's often why churches in Black communities have an outsized influence--if you're raised in an environment where your family isn't there to support you, places like churches will. 

For example--say you have a job interview. But you need a ride? Can you get one? If you have social capital, it would be nothing for you to call up your parents or a nearby friend to make it work. But if your ""social capital"" is small or nonexistent--what are you going to do? There are alternatives, but they're often expensive and/or hard to arrange. 

It's also one of the ways in which the decline of things like churches, fraternal orders, etc, can have a negative impact, because the internet's not going to help in this sense. If all the friends you have live across the country, they can't help babysit your kid. It used to be if you needed advice--""Hey, anyone know a plumber?"" you could ask that after church and get a good recommendation. Today? Hope your plumber has a great SEO!

And this isn't a government thing.

It was awful. I was pretty stressed going outside and never really wanted to walk anywhere. I didn’t think it was safe for my dog bc of all the glass and needles so I got him booties. There was an empty storefront on the corner from us where big groups would hang out and definitely buy/sell crack. All of this was across the st from a courthouse. It was inevitable that you’d step into someone’s shit, dog or human. On my last week I literally saw a man shit into the gutter early morning. I nearly threw up my breakfast. We saw people who looked like nice soccer mom types share crack pipes out of their tent. Everything was just grimy.

What made it worse is that the city gets an ENORMOUS amount of funding, local and federal to deal with this issue. They were paying outrageous money to rent hotel rooms for homeless for at least a year or something, instead of converting or building or. A report came out that they were spending like at least $5k/person/month to let them set up a tent on a city parking lot. That’s a lot of money for 50-100 people to set up their own tents on an empty lot. CA and SF in particular have HIGH taxes on everything. Also high rent for everyone else. The customers pay the health tax instead of the restaurants to give the employees health insurance. A coffee costs at least 4.5$. A car tow is like 700$ if you even graze a wrong end of the curb. That kind of thing.

So yeah, I was pissed about the homelessness and all the issues that brought to everyone else. If I’m paying minimum of 2k for a studio or a 1 bed, then I’d like there not to be shit on my doorstep (happened to my friend a block away). I’d like to walk my dog without checking him every time for cuts. I’d like to walk to the grocery without being harassed or yelled at about being an alien who’s getting inside their head.

Also, apparently breastmilk is a bad term now as well? Again, because its apparently gendered. Again, how is this the case?

Im not kidding. They make whoever survives you send in 2 notarized copies of your death certificate and then they just mark the owner as deceased on the account... and thats it. Nothing else changes. For the first 30 days of nonpayment, the auto dialer will still attempt to call the deceased owner and front end agents will end up getting the voice-mail and having to leave messages asking for the deceased owner. From 30 days onward, the company will have 30+ agents manually dial the account to try and reach the deceased owner. And agents like me still have to skip trace the account trying to find better active numbers *to reach a fucking dead person.* Eventually, they will try to foreclose the account which will stall out because the owner is DEAD. Then and ONLY THEN will the account finally default. And this process typically takes about 5 years.

1710,AskReddit,What’s some weird shit that turns you on?,Walien-2,1647357373.0,6650,10692,0.87,"Lol, a young woman who used to work for me quit and took a different job offer.  According to HR and her exit interview, she took a pay cut with the new job.  I took it kind of hard, I didn't think I was a terrible boss.  I knew I was a little demanding, but I fought for every penny I could for my team and made sure they were paid well above going market rate.  And she performed her job excellently, I pushed so she could get the maximum raise during my teams annual review, and made sure to praise her great performance to her, in front of the team, and to others in the company.  She was one of three members on my team I had fast-tracked for promotion.  When HR told me she took a pay decrease, I was kinda devastated.  Was I putting too much on her plate, was there a bad work-life balance?  Had I made her feel like she was in over her head?  Was there harassment I missed?  I thought I squashed that _very_ hard, including firing two people so I didn't think it was a hostile work environment but i can't see everything.  HR delayed the meeting to discuss it, and then when we had it the woman who did the exit interview sheepishly dodged my questions, and said, ""No.  None of those things.  She thought you were a great boss... only had positive things to say about you.""

I got pretty angry at that point and said, ""How the hell am I supposed to fix a problem if I don't know what the problem is?  For her last two weeks here she avoided me left without a send-off and for a poorer job offer at a worse company?""

I was almost angry enough that i ended that question with an expletive.  The HR rep shrugged and at that point I got so pissed off with how useless I felt HR was in that situation that I left keeping my comments to myself about how that was a waste of time.  She was one of my top performers, with her gone my workload and my team's workload increased significantly.

I wrote an email to the HR director complaining about the poor quality of the exit interview.  HR director responded, ""_employee_ left for personal reasons unrelated to the work environment.  There wasn't anything you could have done differently.""

A few days later the woman who quit called me up and apologized and offered to take me out for drinks.  I wanted to find out the reasoning behind her leaving so accepted.

Eventually, all was made clear.  She worked so hard because she had developed a huge crush on me.  She loved the praise, she loved the intensity of watching me work, she loved seeing me get angry.  And it would get her so worked up it was affecting her job performance.  She told the HR rep she was going to date me because ""how could he say no?""  But figured even a transfer wouldn't be enough as I would still think it unprofessional, so needed to cut ties with the company.

She was right, on all counts.  Hottie, sharp as a razor, my type, and someone with the sort of passion and positive nature that it infects everyone around her.

She still would get very worked up whenever I took a work phone call at home.",1647379727.0,13

I woke up this morning with a bad hangover

And my penis was missing again.

This happens all the time.

It's detachable.

This comes in handy a lot of the time.

I can leave it home, when I think it's gonna get me in trouble,

Or I can rent it out, when I don't need it.

But now and then I go to a party, get drunk,

And the next morning I can't for the life of me

Remember what I did with it.

First I looked around my apartment, and I couldn't find it.

So I called up the place where the party was,

They hadn't seen it either.

I asked them to check the medicine cabinet

'Cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes

But not this time.

So I told them if it pops up to let me know.

I called a few people who were at the party,

But they were no help either.

I was starting to get desperate.

I really don't like being without my penis for too long.

It makes me feel like less of a man,

And I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak.

After a few hours of searching the house,

And calling everyone I could think of,

I was starting to get very depressed,

So I went to the Kiev, and ate breakfast.

Then, as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark's Place,

Where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street,

I saw my penis lying on a blanket

Next to a broken toaster oven.

Some guy was selling it.

I had to buy it off him.

He wanted twenty-two bucks, but I talked him down to seventeen.

I took it home, washed it off,

And put it back on. I was happy again. Complete.

People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached,

But I don't know.

Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass,

I like having a detachable penis.

Yea it's freaky when you start vomitting blood. I was always drinking, from 7AM to to the end of the day (usually when I run out of beer after 24). I did a seizure (my second) and had to go to the hospital for a few weeks. Had valium to help with withdrawal. Liver heppatite too...

Sometimes, your only symptom of a heart attack is a sudden, and very painful toothache.  

Why this happens:

A heart attack occurred, or is about to occur.  Your brain has to interpret the event.  The brain will then send a pain signal, to alert you of the event.  The brain sends a pain signal to the nerve path, as if to say 

> Something is happening ON THIS NERVE PATH. 

Since your teeth/jaw are on the same nerve path as your heart, sometimes the symptoms can be felt there, or radiating along your ear.  In other words, the right nerve was firing up, but the wrong organ was hurting. 

Basically, you don’t experience a heart attack every day, so your brain’s first interpretation of this event can be kinda wonky.  Think of it like when your check engine light comes on for something you know isn’t related to the engine 

It is called “Referred Pain.”  It goes against everything we understand about how pain signals work.  This is also why your left arm can hurt during a heart attack, but not many people are aware that other organs are innervated by the same exact nerve",1647349236.0,64

2. A sudden change in mental status - “do you know where you are? Do you what today is? Do you know who the president is?”

3. Shortness of breath with chest pain (especially if you had recent surgery) - this could be a sign of a blood clot or if it moves to the lungs, a pulmonary embolism.

3261,AskReddit,Whats a sign you need to immediately go to the hospital?,phenomLG,1647321016.0,11486,28322,0.91,"I'm fine now, but:

I received a very brief but very real shock to my hand from a 240V alternating current source a year ago.  It felt like the wire reached out and literally grabbed my hand--violently.  And it immediately hurt.  Although my arm immediately locked into position, I was fortunately able to push myself back *(Edit: pushed back mostly using my legs, as I was in a crouched position)* and break off of the contact point.  Nonetheless, I instantly knew an ER visit was absolutely warranted for the situation.  The contact point was the tip of my middle finger and I was actually bleeding from it at my nail bed (bleeding stopped relatively easily, like it would with a shallow nick from a knife).  Once at the ER (within about 1 hour of the injury), they had me hooked up to a 12 point EKG to check my heart beat rhythm--a very common way to die from electric shock is through the electric impulse messing up your heart's rhythm.  They could very quickly at that point (<5 minutes) see that my heart was fine, although they did keep me hooked up to a ~5 point (I can't recall how many points, just that they took off some of them and kept some on) EKG to monitor my heart rhythm the rest of the time I was there.

My heart being deemed ""fine"", the ER staff moved on to the next concern: potential internal injury from the shock by way of electric burn.  First, they checked me head to toe to try and find any signs of an ""exit wound""--finding one would indicate that the electricity didn't just contact me, but also ran a current *through* me, which can cause a MUCH more harmful electric injury.  I didn't have any visible signs of one, which was, frankly, miraculous, because I was being an absolute idiot about what I was doing to get this shock in the first place, and made no preventative measures to avoid getting shocked.  It is an act of God that I'm not dead from this.

Absent visible sign of an exit wound, they took blood samples from me to check for what they described as ""a biochemical marker in your blood indicating tissue damage"".  Ordinarily, this biochemical molecule is present in your blood stream at very low levels.  They didn't indicate the units, but they said ""about 200 is normal"".  I was at 400.  They reassured me though that this level, though 2x the normal mark, indicates only a very mild tissue injury, and was no cause for concern.  They get worried when the level is actually much higher--they quoted me figures in the high 1,000s, if not even into the 10,000s.  Those are the kinds of levels they see with people who make contact with the switch gear at electrical power substations.  240V electric shock in a residential home was, comparatively, a papercut.

The whole time I was there they had an IV in my arm giving me fluids and a mild pain killer (after all, my hand and forearm were pretty sore from the shock, and I was generally uncomfortable from the stress of the situation).  I can't quite remember what held us there as long as we were there, but after about 3 or 4 hours they released us (my wife drove me to the ER and was there with me the whole time).  It might have been the lab work for my blood samples that took the longest, because I think once they got those results back, they started the process of releasing me.  At the end of it all, I was diagnosed with having an electric burn at the tip of my finger, and a follow-up at a burn center 1 week later confirmed that I was good to move on with my life without any more concern about the injury.

**TL;DR: Absolutely do not ever play with ""Live"" electric circuits if you can avoid it, and don't ever dismiss an electric shock as ""nothing"" just because it didn't kill you immediately.**",1647347156.0,30

 I found myself, in that glorious illusion of high summer days, gliding, flying, now and again lurching through cloud banks and ethers, past stars, and across fields of ice crystals. Even now, I can see in my mind’s rather peculiar eye an extraordinary shattering and shifting of light; inconstant but ravishing colors laid out across miles of circling rings. I saw and experienced that which had been only dreams, or fitful fragments of aspiration.


There is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. 


But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern. Everything previously moving with the grain is now against-- you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and enmeshed totally in the blackest caves of the mind. You never knew those caves were there. It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.


My family and friends expected that I would welcome being “normal,” be appreciative of lithium, and take in stride having normal energy and sleep. But if you have had stars at your feet and the rings of planets through your hands, are used to sleeping only four or five hours a night and now sleep eight, are used to staying up all night for days and weeks in a row and now cannot, it is a very real adjustment to blend into a three-piece-suit schedule, which, while comfortable to many, is new, restrictive, seemingly less productive, and maddeningly less intoxicating.


People say, when I complain of being less lively, less energetic, less high-spirited, “Well, now you’re just like the rest of us,” meaning, among other things, to be reassuring. But I compare myself with my former self, not with others. Not only that, I tend to compare my current self with the best I have been, which is when I have been mildly [hypo]manic. When I am my present “normal” self, I am far removed from when I have been my liveliest, most productive, most intense, most outgoing and effervescent. 

In short, for myself, I am a hard act to follow.


And I miss Saturn very much.""

Many months later, and I still get anxious if I stutter, or go into a room and forget why I went into it.

EDIT: There are a lot of replies about the ER doctor being called an idiot, so let me clarify. Firstly, the Neurologist called him an idiot, not me. I think of this doctor highly, and it would have been wildly irresponsible of him not to treat it as a stroke. The error he made was doubling down that it was a stroke every time a test came back negative, and giving no alternative explanation - this is despite me being in my 20s, in perfect health, having a history of migraines, a clear CT scan, a clear MRI scan, clear heart ultrasounds, clear blood tests.

On Friday, she had started to feel pain in her kidneys. She had had a kidney infection before and said it felt exactly like that except in both kidneys. It was too late for a doctor so she decided to tough it out until Monday.

By Saturday night, the pain was too bad and she wanted to get it dealt with. We don't have an urgent care center locally so the ER is your only choice to be able to get the antibiotics.

We go in and the doctor immediately decides it's kidney stones and orders a CT. I asked if it's common to get them in both kidneys at the same time and he got defensive and said ""it could happen"". He also ordered that my wife had one of the IV access things (not sure what they're called? Port? PICC? something like that) put in her hand. While the nurse is doing that, she tells my wife the she (the nurse) isn't sure why they were doing that.

We wait around for a couple of hours, she gets the scan, we wait another couple of hours (all while wife is intense pain) for it to get read. Doctor comes in and tells her the scan shows she has a couple of small stones but they haven't started moving yet so that wasn't the issue and then leaves. Nurse comes back in, removes the IV thing and has wife give a urine sample. 15 minutes later, they come back and - surprise, surprise - it's a bladder infection. Wife gets her antibiotics and we go home, six hours after we went in.

Ended up costing us about $2000 after insurance due to the CT scans.",1647358829.0,19

Your leaders have got so many of you convinced that our healthcare system is trash and the wait times are extremely long when that just isn't the case. Our healthcare system works similarly to emergency room triage protocols, meaning the sickest go first. So for example, 2 people get referred to the same specialist, say neurologist. Patient 1 complains of intense headaches 3 or 4 times a month, and patient 2 is having seizures multiple times a week. Patient 2 clearly presents the most risk so they will be seen first, then patient 1 afterwards. If you find yourself with a long wait time in canada it typically means 1 of 2 things, first, your need is not as urgent so you aren't first in line. The second reason is you may be asking to see a specific doctor that is in high demand due to good reviews, however you would be able to skip the wait time if you see another doctor in the same specialty. It's not hard at all to be seen quickly in canada, i've never experienced more than a 5 week waiting period for a surgeon and the only reason it was that long was because i was willing to wait to be able to see this specific doctor because he had operated on my family member with the same health issue i have so he had experience with my disease plus did a great job with my family member so i was happy to wait until i was able to see him.

Pooping black usually means blood from the stomach, but a brisk upper GI bleed can put out red blood per rectum. 

One thing to know about medicine, the typical presentation is not always the most likely. But the laws of physics still apply. Black stool can be from the colon, sure. But you’d never throw up blood from the colon. 

Getting a good history and exam on your patient, assessing the vitals, and triaging are key. Labs are helpful but the change in blood count lags far behind blood loss.

About 9 months later and things seem to have improved, I had a surgery involving anesthesia and then Percocet for recovery. About two weeks after my surgery and pretty much fully recovered, I started feeling really fucking good. I didn’t sleep. Didn’t need to. I was super outgoing and positive and full of gratitude. I started calling everyone in my life to tell them how much they meant to me. I felt alive for the first time in a few years after being depressed for several after a bad breakup. 

Then my body started shutting down. I couldn’t focus and kept getting lost on my way home from work. I went from being able to do my mail route in 5 or 6 hours to taking 12 hours. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time and leaving tons of notes around the house some apologizing to my gf and some expressing my fear of her. I couldn’t remember if I turned the oven off when cooking. I was getting very loopy. My writing and speech started getting very nonsensical. After nine or ten days of no sleep and being out of it I summoned the strength of mind to call my friend and have him take me to the hospital. I am now in a crisis center at the hospital where they send in a social worker to talk to me and I just start rabidly unloading years of pent up trauma. They thought I was on meth and were shocked when my drug test came back clean. I then experienced tons of different personalities that would shift very quickly. I had visual and auditory hallucinations of my cat meowing and my dad coming up behind me to hurt me in the bathroom mirror and it seemed real as day at the time. Fucking terrifying experience. 

Then I spent two weeks in a facility where I had the godlike smarter than everyone/incredibly witty/fast thinking abilities. I could go on and on about this experience. But if you ever feel anything like what I’ve described seek medical attention.

It’s been two years almost now since that event and I’m still trying to figure out my diagnosis. I was declared bipolar and put on meds that made me gain a lot of weight. I’m talking 80 pounds or so. I’ve been through a few other medications and psychiatrists and think I’ve finally found one who understands what the drug interaction did.

You can have to dodge the exact same spells and abilities to get in range as a melee character does to do any damage, except you are wearing robes with less vigor.

Having to split your flasks to have more FP than melee characters also hurts a LOT in 2 phase fights.

I think being a sorcerer makes early game easier since bosses and enemies are not nearly as mobile and there are way less AOE effects which 1-shot you. You can also comet azur 100-0 many mid game bosses. But not at the end game",1647382470.0,3

At 150 the final boss certainly wasn't a push over even if it wasn't the hardest boss I'd fought so far.

Besides that, From Soft follows the 80-20 rule (the Pareto principle) when it comes to progression. 80% of your levels will come from 20% of your kills i.e your boss kills, because end-game bosses drop that many more runes than early game bosses and especially other basic enemies.

The Isshin fight took me longer than Demon of Hatred but I'm not sure which I thought was harder. Isshin felt like a culmination of a whole bunch of moves and patterns and tricks that the game had thrown at me before, but spread out across 4 phases which took some time to learn. Demon felt like it was a boss fight from a completely different game and made me play a much more distance and dodging focused hit and run style unlike most other fights where I'd be in the enemy's face constantly attacking or parrying to go for enough of a combo to get the stance break kill. Once I changed my strategy I found Demon easier, but Isshin I felt more prepared for and comfortable while learning (dying to).

It always takes a while to even figure out the significance of what I'm doing, but that moment where it *clicks* and I understand the dungeon is always great.

I loved BoTW, but didn't love how only 4 dungeons were like this, and they're all optional in the first place. If there were fewer shrines, but with greater rewards/difficulty, and each dungeon were more like a traditional zelda dungeon, I think that would hit a nice sweet spot for open world but still zelda.

I can explore hebra for a whole day and still find new things. I can explore hyrule forest and find even more new things. I logged in more than few hundred hours because even if you completely the basic story, you can find new stories.

I completely understood most people's frustration with the lack of story but after playing for awhile, I completely disagree. There is so much story in the game that I would play on for hours.

The difficulty works in these games because it's paired with two things: high lethality, and high player expression. 

Most bosses take less than 30 hits to kill, which is really quite few when you consider how fast players attack. Fights are decided quickly - it's pretty rare for a fight to be ""close"", usually either the player has mastered the boss and wipes the floor with them or the boss one shots the player at some point. The combat is lethal, enemies kill the player quickly but players can do the same to enemies. When the player one shots a mook with a backstab or burns down a tough enemy in a single R1 combo, it feels good - and when an enemy fakes you out and rips your health apart, you feel suitably humbled.

And on the other side, the player expression in the game is huge. A parrying dagger user is going to play different from someone powerstancing greatswords, will play massively different from an arcane spellcaster, will play different from a dodgeroll spamming quality build, etc. I've cut apart bosses people were stuck on for hours, and been stonewalled by bosses that most people basically shrugged off, because how I express myself in combat - the stats and buffs and consumables and gear I use - is different and gives me an advantage over some bosses and is flattened by others.

It's fitting that this joke ~~originally came from~~ is stolen from IronPineapple, because he covers a lot of games that make this mistake in his Steam Dumpster Diving series. A lot of fans of Souls-like games think that the difficulty is the defining feature. But it's really not, the games are hard but that's because they pull their punches *less* than other games (though they still heavily favor the player). But to counter this, the player gets *way* more options than most ARPG's give you that can give you the edge over your enemy *if you know how to leverage them*. You can't have one without the other, the game doesn't hold your hand but *that's because it gave you the options that an easier game would have handled for you*.",1647374205.0,11

That sense of awe and discovery is still pervasive, even over 100hrs in. And I have no signs of slowing down or fatigue.. I actually want to explore more.

Like the lack of a quest track, or how devoided of orientation the game is to make navigating the world and finding things as rewarding as possible. I fear this will be subverted to thinking that games with bad uis should be the norm, or that lack of content = having to explore to find quests.

To me what makes ER great is how nothing is given to you for free. And you can play the game and miss a lot of amazing stuff, but the devs don't put an arrow trying to direct players to that amazing piece if content they threw in hundreds of hours creating. Instead if you find it then it just makes it even more amazing that you actually found that amazing moment or item.

I feel like ER invoque a sense of high punishment but also high reward in the sense that you need to try to get the best out of the game, and if you chose to not devote yourself to it, then it won't give everything back at you. It gives in equal proportion to what you are willing to invest I exploration, time and paying attention to what the devs created.

I might be a bit enamored with the game right now, but I honestly feel like few games have the guts to throw a player into a gigantic world full of content but hide the best away and force you to work for it.

Dark souls feels like a card game. You want to collect all the cards then make your deck with crazy combos and interactions. In elden ring I want all the tools available so I make my crazy combos.

It's like half half, seems like half the players are completionists and the other half are experience purists. None are wrong. 

The map is really too big to spend this much effort searching for every tricky hidden dungeon.

If you want to hand hold, that's fine, there are plenty of good ways to do that.

If you *don't* want to hand hold, then you need interactions that teach you how to play the game.  This is something that From is generally very good about doing.  They teach you obvious things quickly (""you're going to die, and that's okay""), but they also teach you other things (""You just got shot by an arrow.  Here's a shield.  Try not getting shot by arrows anymore,"" ""Here's a boss that isn't putting up with your rolling around shit; learn to parry or die,"" etc).  Other developers look at From games and say, ""Okay, got it.

Most of the focus now seems to be on delayed attacks where you have to memorize the timing. Though depending on your build you can somewhat mitigate both of those by using a shield with good stability and damage absorption and be able to block most attacks where it then just becomes a matter of having good stamina management so that you don't get guard-broken while blocking. Another option would be to make a glass cannon mage build where you summon spirit ashes at the start of every fight to distract the enemy for you while you sit back and cast spells from afar.

So all things considered I don't think you'd have a huge problem with the game with slower reaction times. It may somewhat limit what kinds of play styles you'd be able to viably do but you'll always have options available to be able to reliably overcome any challenge.",1647374919.0,3

Without spoiling anything for others who don't have as much progress, there is a huge problem with quest lines in the game. One quest line gets locked if you complete an optional dungeon too early.  Too early doesn't mean you do some speed run skips or warps, it literally is just arbitrary. You can progress and most people who don't look at guides will just follow the path thats open to them and accidentally lock themselves out of it. 

Did I also mention this questline has a bunch of items(weapons and armor) locked behind it? It does and it frustrates me that you can lock yourself out of it. I'm fine with this style of thing if it was a choice(x or y questline for dungeon), but you can literally do everything if you hold off on x until y is done. Its not a choice, its bad design. 

Not to mention, some npcs early in the quest tell you that the quest isn't morally good. Most people might shrug that off since its a Soulsborne, but new players might think ""Hey, I should do this quest line after the other one since it might have permanent negative effects"". It doesn't.

I get that you don't need every item to have fun in the game, but that should be up to player choice, not player knowledge. FF12 had a more extreme version, if you opened any of a certain amount of fake chests, you literally couldn't get the best spear in the game. These chests were randomly dispersed throughout the game and the game didn't telegraph and say ""Hey if you open certain chests, you might not be able to get x item"". This isn't nearly as bad as that, but it shares the same element of frustration due to a player not googling everything. I'm lucky I became obsessed with the game early in my playtime and came by this fact. Otherwise, I might have locked myself out.

So whats the solution? Either don't make the questlines you are locked out of lock you out of items(for example, you could have an alternative way of obtaining the items), make it a clearly telegraphed choice, or make the questline not dependent on arbitrary completion. You can easily make another npc offer a similar questline if for some reason the choice makes the original quest giver angry at you.

For anyone early on that might be deterred from playing blind by this, maybe I can give a bit of info to help. If you are doing an optional dungeon(or at least one that you aren't sure of), make sure you complete any quests you want before the final boss of that dungeon.",1647369538.0,8

1. Balance. It's pretty poor thanks to the open world both in upgrading and natural progression.
2. The final third. It's absurdly difficult in bad ways, not ""fair"" ways.
3. Reused assets. Much like all open world games, if you need to reuse that many assets, shorten the game instead of doing the opposite and padding it.
4. Boss design. The movements themselves and the difficulty feel worse than before. My #1 complaint is the lack of ability to punish, mostly with the main story bosses. I think BB, DS3, and Sekiro blow ER out of the water with boss design. There's zero flow and some of the actual choices are baffling. Shit like Radahn and Malenia don't even seem to have been playtested. Then add shit like how about midway through the game, the game gets lazy as fuck and just starts spamming gank fights with previous used enemies.
5. The open world. It's empty. I'm kinda baffled people are claiming it's dense. It has no more weapons or enemy variety than something like DS3 which is obvious much less smaller. Exploration isn't really worth it if you like your current weapons and/or ashes. Like I don't miss collecting BS collectibles just for  shit achievement, but the world is quite barren. It doesn't feel lived in at all.
6. Side content. I know this is FromSoft's thing but if you're gonna have a 100+ hour game, you need something other than combat. There's nothing other than combat.  Other open worlds like Witcher, Horizon, Oblivion, etc. don't add random content like side mission, parkour challenges, mini games, puzzles, etc. because they're padding the game. They know that if you're gonna spend a long time on something, it's nice to break the flow. That doesn't exist in ER. The exclusive thing to break flow is exploration, exploration that leads to more combat.
7. Side missions. Keeping the same side quest style as Souls/BB/Sekiro is just dumb. You can't be as obtuse when you're switching from 20/30 hours to 100. They don't even have a log.",1647369020.0,3

Yea the final part has been hard but I also had low vigor so I just invested in Health and I was good to go there's plenty of ways to get tons of runes for leveling. 

Compared to many other open world games I've played this game doesn't reuse nearly as much. Sure it's less exciting when you fight the same enemy or boss again but one the reused bosses are pretty much all optional meaning your expectations aren't as high and two there's so much unique locations and enemies that the reused stuff isnt as bad. I can't think of another open world game with this much distinct visual variety and enemy variety. 

That boss point is super subjective and for me and many others it's just learning attacks or using the right tools no boss has really seemed unfair just some take longer to learn than others. 

I don't understand how you think the world is empty there's so much stuff all over the place and the lack of objective markers makes it better to explore it isn't that stupid checklist style of open world. If you're not willing to experiment and try new load outs than it's your fault the rewards are boring for you. Respecing is easier than ever and you can't blame the game when you're refusing to change how you play and try something new.  

It's a souls game and you're surprised it has souls gameplay im for one glad they don't just add a bunch of open world bs and stick with what they do best and do that one thing well. 

Yea there's no quest log and it's a bit annoying but the side quests I do solve on my own are super satisfying. These game are vague and obtuse so the community can discover things together and it's that which makes these games so enduring.",1647370598.0,2

Nothing stops you from just not beelining straight to whatever meta gear you can grab to trivialize zones.

As far as reused assets go, there are a few annoying examples but the majority are overblown. Erdtree guardians and the rot beasts are definitely the worst examples. Crucible knights are another frequently listed example but I feel there's enough variety amongst the variants to defer that complaint.

Your complaints about the bosses are too vague to properly respond to. The only thing I can see is ""the windows of opportunity are too small"". This is just a case of the git guds. You're not supposed to be able to nuke them down in one or two combos like many bosses could be cheesed in past games. The new design is intended to make the fights as a fight instead of a quick comp stomp.

As far as exploration goes the map is certainly larger than it needs to be, which is why you get a horse for travel. The point with exploration is that every point of interest has something worthwhile. Not that it has something for every build, or for every playthrough. Just skip it if you don't want the loot.

Most of your listed examples just have checkbox collectibles aka garbage filler content. Obviously if you like checking boxes then you'll enjoy games where boxes are being checked, but it has no place in Elden Ring's setting, nor does it fit the gameplay.

Also, can I just say ""I beat him in 2 tries"" is legit fucking annoying? If enough people are complaining about him, I don't care if you figured him out quicker.",1647375880.0,2

I did it's still not balanced. For instance, in my first playthrough despite following pretty close to what the game gives you in terms of progression, I'd be stuck at like +10 weapon for 10 hours. I'll find one missing stone and shoot up to +17. I had this happen twice and have seen others with the same. Also, the enemies really aren't balanced land to land. Take the run of the Erdtree to the dragon to the twinblade dude to the beat priest. All in Caelid, all were massive jumps compared to everyone else. Same as the dragonrot dragon. The difficulty spikes are all over the fucking place. Also, Runes are not balanced at all. You get very little in return despite each area.

>As far as reused assets go, there are a few annoying examples but the majority are overblown. Erdtree guardians and the rot beasts are definitely the worst examples. Crucible knights are another frequently listed example but I feel there's enough variety amongst the variants to defer that complaint.

This is contextual. I'm not complaining about variety. I'm complaining about people claiming ""around every corner is something unique"" and shitting on other games in the process to make it seem like FromSoft isn't. Also, I just kinda disagree. After about halfway through there's major issues with variety.

>This is just a case of the git guds.

No. That's not a case. I've always despised this defense. The crux of FromSoft is no artificial difficulty. Getting two shotted on a 60 Vig build at the end of the game and enemies that do not allow punishes is not fair and balanced. More bosses than ever feel like luck. Also, git gud has a limit. I mean with this mentality, literally any shit game should not be criticized, literally just perfect a boss fight even if it takes 7-8 hours. There's almost no flow involved in bosses.

>The point with exploration is that every point of interest has something worthwhile.

I keep seeing this and it's a straight up lie. I don't need 50 fucking ashes and mixed physics. Also, if the game is too big and there's so much exploration, is it worth it if the game gets boring?

>Why can't you keep a log? Try pen + paper.

This is easily the worst thing you said. Why do I need a pen and paper? Better games keep the log for you. Like why is it good design to ask me to need more than the game system to even keep track of a quest?",1647376565.0,2

I never said you said that.

It's not a strawman either because a strawman requires misrepresenting your argument which I'm not doing because I'm not even presenting your argument at all. 

>I said most players don’t feel like that. Which is true.

All I'm saying is that the game can feel repetitive because it recycles content and can't force a ""remix"" of enemies due to the nature of an open world.

The main games I listed below.  There are some spinoffs and minor entries but the below is the ""meat"".  GTAIV had DLC, there was also vice city stories and liberty city stories.

I remeber waiting for GTA IV - it felt like an eternity because in that era (2004 to 2008) games were released at MOST 3 years apart.  4 years was unheard of.  Now we're at a period of time where 3 years for a sequel is unheard of, as games are supported longer to make more money without having to input as much effort.  Single player has been forgotten.  It's so sad it's more profitable to have an ingame casino and sell virtual cash than it is to release quality products.  Every title below was singleplayer, except for GTA IV and V.  GTA IV had bare bones online in which the sole purpose was really just fucking around with other players.  Weapons and ammo spawned on the map, and you had everyone driving around in the sultan rs.  GTA IV also had two single player DLCs.

But by getting this close to the nest, OP is keeping the parents away, making the babies miss vital feedings that can make the difference between a baby that thrives and one that dies, either as a baby or even later on due to not getting enough nutrition when young.

(OC)",Business_Endeavors,1647364831.0,629,22372,0.8,"For kittens the rule of thumb is do they look like a healthy weight? Are they clean? If yes, then their mom is probably just out getting food. You should call a local place that does TNR and someone can try to trap mama and her babies for fostering. When the kittens are old enough, mama will be spayed and released (unless she can be socialized but most adult feral cats are beyond that point) and the kittens can be adopted. The kittens still get the important development but they don’t end up on the street. 

However, if the kitten looks sick, super skinny, lame, or dirty then it was probably abandoned. I was driving home one night and while stopped at a light I heard a kitten crying out. I looped around the block and saw the poor thing had wedged itself between a door and the bars in front of the door. He looked pretty dirty and skinny so I scooped him up and brought him home. Sure enough, he couldn’t put any weight on one of his back legs and it ended up that he had a pretty bad abscess. Mama’s know when their babies won’t survive and their instinct is to abandon it. Kitten got antibiotics and stayed with me until he could be neutered and he got adopted within an hour of being available at the shelter 🥲

Edit: don’t feel bad about picking the kitten up though! I did the same before I learned more. Mama was probably confused but cats don’t form the same bonds that humans do so it’s okay.",1647387882.0,1

Nature does X is not a justification for anything because humans are not separate from Nature. We are not some special godly alien species that lives independently of nature. 

When we save our fellow humans or take in animals to a wildlife refuge, we are not superseding nature. That is simply nature acting through humans. 

It is ridiculous to consider our actions and existence as separate or even in defiance of nature.

This doesn't justify the destruction of our environment or ecosystems obviously. Destroying or polluting one's environment is natural to humans and if we don't evolve to stop doing that, we will go extinct, which would be completely natural.

In many animals though excess electrolytes can have very negative consequences and even cause urinary blockages, which is why you wouldn't want to give it to your cat or dog on a daily basis.

Animals typically get enough salts/electrolytes from their food that distilled water isn't really an issue. Especially if they are carnivores or omnivores.",1647380797.0,19

5125,aww,"A hot day with no parent birds around for hours, so I thought I’d offer rehydration until the worms arrive. (OC)",Business_Endeavors,1647364831.0,629,22372,0.8,"I don't even use metal in my water filtration system because everything is plastic. And that's like saying not to eat spaghetti sauce because if you cook it in a copper pan it will leach copper into your sauce. Right tools for the right job. Piping DI water through metal pipes totally defeats the purpose of deionizing it in the first place. Just why? Where would you even get DI water that has been through metal pipes? Who would make or sell such a thing? And as we've seen from the situation in Flint, you don't even need DI water for metal pipe leaching to become a problem anyway. So, I use plastic for my filter and I can't imagine that anyone would not, especially not for drinking.

Here's an _actual_ study, not anecdotal evidence, from the WHO, on the health impacts of drinking deionized water, from the perspective of not getting enough minerals: http://www.accomplishmoretoday.com/public/images/WHO%20Nutrients%20in%20Drinking%20Water.pdf#page=157

The conclusion:

>There is little evidence that supports an association between water hardness or Ca
concentration in DW [drinking water] and CVD [cardiovascular disease]

It also says:

>However, the available information from experimental, clinical
and epidemiological studies supports the hypothesis that a lower than recommended intake of Mg
is a condition that increases the risk of dying from, and possibly developing, CVD, stroke or
hypertension.

This is relevant because the rest of the article mentions that Western diets are often very low in magnesium.

And...that's really the only useful article I could find that's explicitly about drinking deionized or distilled water. Most other articles simply say they fed rats distilled water but they were testing something else; they used distilled water to prevent confounding factors from tap or other water.

There's also this article which bills itself as ""opinion"":

https://www.webmedcentral.com/wmcpdf/Article_WMC002554.pdf

It does conclude that distilled water is better but it's based on no evidence at all and it's basically just ""because I think it should be"". It runs dangerously close to the spaghetti-in-copper-pan fallacy again, only this time it's used to support distilled water over tap.

As for whether anyone can rely on tap water to provide for their mineral and especially magnesium needs, North American water often includes significantly more magnesium relative to calcium than European water, but even drinking 2 liters of water (i.e. the ""recommended"" 8 cups of water per day) will not get you to 100% DRI ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495189/)). So no matter what, you'd still better be getting a lot of your minerals from your diet; you shouldn't rely on being able to get it from your water only. That applies even more so for areas where the water is already very soft without deionization, such as those parts of the San Francisco Bay Area that get their water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite. I live in such an area, so the end result is that there is no way I'm getting enough minerals from my water no matter what I drink.

Another common argument against drinking distilled or deionized water is that it ""strips"" the ions away from your body. That's of course total nonsense and there is no biological mechanism for such a thing; your cells and especially your kidneys are much more competent than that. _Any_ water you drink is significantly less concentrated than your body. Even the hardest drinkable water, in enough quantity, will cause water intoxication. For reference, an ""isotonic"" (same concentration as your body) solution is considered to be 0.3 osmolar. ""Hard"" water starts at about 0.003 osmolar, safe drinking water is said to be 0.006-0.009 osmolar or lower, and seawater is about 1.0 osmolar.

To be honest, I'm thinking of getting rid of my water filtration system anyway as it wastes a lot of water and prevents me from getting fluoride in my drinking water, but another consequence of living in the Bay Area is that water is often contaminated with runoff from high-tech manufacturing and sometimes fertilizers.",1647383043.0,-1

Just a general PSA: leave baby deer where you find them! The mom is probably out and about and will be back soon. Only intervene if you find a baby either a) standing next to a dead adult female deer or b) in the same spot the next day with wrinkled ears. That’s a sign of dehydration and a signal that the mom hasn’t been around to feed it.

Even if it doesn't, let nature take it's course.

If you ABSOLUTELY care, then keep a far distance and check in the morning. Sometimes it can do more harm then good.

The type of animal may involve different circumstances. Things like taking baby rabbits to the local animal hospital....you don't want to know what they really end up doing to them.

5580,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1152,84465,0.95,"This is absolutely incorrect.

“Tenga” is the wrong form of “tener” to use in this case. Guy in the video said it twice, knew it didn’t sound right, and corrected himself the third time.

We all know what he *meant* and what was implied by him saying “tengas”. It doesn’t change the fact that it was the wrong tense to use.

It appears you’re misunderstanding the subjective form. Certain words or phrases must trigger the subjective form. “¿No tengas?” is not a phrase that can exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other words. Examples are “no tengas miedo” (don’t be afraid), “espero que tengas dinero” (I expect that you’ll have money), and “ojalá que tengas mamá” (I hope you have a mom).

5581,aww,Meep,CreeperCallum,1647349842.0,1152,84465,0.95,"nah it's not correct. It is true that it is subjuntive, but subjuntive needs a different structure and context. 
You can say ""Es triste que no tengas (una) mamá"" to mean ""<it> is sad that <you> don't have (a) mom"", but you can't say ""tengas mamá?"" , it would mean something like ""that you have mom?"" or some gibberish. I mean, most people would understand you, after a few tries. 

Like, to use subjuntive, you need to turn the sentence with the subjuntive verb into a noun ""(you not having a mom) is sad"" -》 ""(that) is sad""

""(Que no tengas mamá) es triste"" -》 ""(eso) es triste""      

However when not having it be the subject of a different sentence, the subjuntive verb simply feels out of place, trying to connect the sentence to a condition or consequence that is simply not there. 

The main problem with it is that, since it is unexpected to see a subjuntive there, at first it doesn't sound like a form of the verb tener (have), but as a different, unknown word. That is just my opinion from hearing ""Tengas mamá"", since I needed to hear him say it twice to understans what he was trying to say. 

I am native from Spain, so some rules may be greatly different for American Spanish (""Latino""), and also being native means that we make a lot of mistakes from simply having learnt it naturally insteas of studied it (like the famous ""They're/there"", which for a native speaker it feels so natural so they may make that mistake, but for someone who studied it as a secondary language, it is a very hard mistake to make since well, one has They and the verb to be, while the other does not.)",1647362715.0,6

For example, compare [have](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EnVerbs.aspx?v=have) and [tener](https://www.wordreference.com/conj/EsVerbs.aspx?v=tener).

The correct way to say ""you don't have a mom?"" is ""[tú] no tienes [mamá]?"" (square brackets for words that can be omitted). This is indicative present second person (you).

""[tú] no tengas [mamá]?"" doesn't make any sense because it's in the subjunctive mood, present, second person (you). Subjunctive is hard to explain, but it's a more ""what-ify"" way of talking. (I'm clearly ass at grammar theory.)

I'm 36 this year and I was around for the start of the internet there was no golden age of internet.  Internet was slow, cost an arm and a leg to Access. Filled the things trying to sell you stuff. That fucking load page on AOL or yahoo....

It was more Anonymous and that's about it. You could still find beloved children characters fucking each other on the Internet.

 And well yes it's not perfect now, And people should definitely really  think about how we live our lives with social media. 

The internet has vastly improved. From what it use to be.  You can find obscure fact knowledge's way faster, Then searching 7 websites on a web link. You can have a career making silly songs. You can play games with people you never met. You can now video call your grandma who lives in another country. All thanks to tech gaints.

 I understand that Tech giants suck, I do. But to look the internet as a we sold ourselves to villains is Just unfair a unfair way to look at the Internet.",1647370412.0,-8

I was 12 when it came out and just about every song was heard off that album somewhere you went. Sporting event? Half time show included cheerleaders dancing to 'PYT'. School talent show? Kids doing their take on 'Thriller' or someone moonwalking to 'Billie Jean' -  it has so much crossover appeal that everyone from young kids to adults in their 50-60s enjoyed it.

I never even liked Michael Jackson all that much, but there was no denying his influence.  He was singularly the most recognizable human being on the planet.  Literally no-one has repeated the fame and popularity that he represented in the early 1980's. Kanye can only dream of reaching the kind of fame Michael Jackson had.  One thing to remember is this is way before the internet was anything more than a nerd dream at DARPA, and mobile phones weren't even a thing. He achieved this fame in an analog world.  Maybe only Beatlemania was more powerful an event than Mr. Jackson, but I'm pretty sure that was limited to a few countries in the western world, Michael's fame was truly worldwide and longer lasting.

His music/rhythm has always resonated with me, and that also explains why Sonic 3's soundtrack was SO incredible, because he helped work on it, but bailed later on.

I don't even know if I'd say Thriller was his peak, I think it might have been Bad, the next album. I was a bit too young for thriller, although even then I was aware of it but as big as he was I think Bad cemented it. Around the same time we got Moonwalker, which I got to see in the cinema and one of the first Megadrive games I owned was a Japanese copy of the Moonwalker game.

He was everywhere. Even if you weren't a fan he was in the news all the time too. Everyone seemed to love him too, we did a survey at school and one of the questions we asked was ""who is your favourite musician/group"" and my whole class bar one said Michael Jackson. It certainly wasn't word of mouth, you just had to consume any sort of media to be aware of him

I can only imagine that he was the new Elvis. Elvis was a huge star and made multiple films as well as his music. There's not really anyone like that today. I can only imagine that you'd need to combine Beyoncé with Taylor Swift and Drake.

Pop music is so different too. Firstly there isn't a lot of it but most of it seems to be written for teens or kids while pop music in the 80's was something that adults could appreciate and we've sort of lost that. That's not to say there wasn't stuff aimed at kids either but there was plenty of songs that adults could enjoy. It also felt like songs that did well on the charts really earnt it. Songs would gradually rise up the charts and gain exposure and a larger audience would buy the single and so on. It was almost like a series of tests and the ones that passed got rewarded.

The radio was huge, music videos played off that, then once the internet started picking up and people could find new artists through that, it started to kill off the radio and music videos. 

The Buggles has a song called video killed the radio star, which is spot on. To be big during that time, you had to have a music video.

By comparison, MJ was bigger than god for a few years before fading slowly as times changed and he didn’t adapt in a way that resonated very well. He was still huge but as he was no longer defining culture, it seemed like he was increasingly lost in the tall grass. Then he spiraled and it was viscerally unsettling. “Cringey” doesn’t even come close to describing the phenomenon. This was still before the allegations of him doing… idk, whatever the hell he was doing at the ranch. His videos, which were packaged as equally significant as his singles, just got disturbing in an “uncanny valley” kind of way. He didn’t seem entirely human anymore and he kept drifting away from being relatable in any way. There wasn’t nostalgia for at least a decade after Thriller, if not longer. When I hear one of those classic songs now, it’s like a gift. I don’t queue him up on streaming services. I don’t think of it. It’s probably because I discovered a love for music by people like Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and even Parliament.
I think that music resonates more and feels timeless. It scratches that itch that I’d otherwise get for MJ. At MJ’s peak, though, he stood higher than anyone. No one’s been there since. Music is so much more accessible and pop culture is more tribal, so we’ll never see or hear anything like it.",1647374216.0,1

I remember loving his songs at a young age. Thriller was of course great but we couldn’t listen or watch the video because of “satan”. However Black and White, You Are Not Alone, Beat It, Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, ans probably more I missed were always played even at church “dances’.

When he passed, or more technically correct, was murdered it was like a hit to my childhood. I was early 20’s at the time, and it was one of the last relics of my life from younger days. I knew he was getting his This is It tour ready, and I wanted to go see him live.

Since then, all the shit that’s come out and behind the scenes video just shows me a dude who worked his fucking ass off to perfection, expected that of you too, but also seemed to care about people too. You see the YouTube where he doesn’t miss a beat when some crazy fan climbs a lift and almost puts his and MJ’s life at risk.

The saddest shit is him having to pay to have a grocery store normal ass day. That’s fucking famous. Like we have had some big stars show up in our tiny ass back woods state and you’ll see social media posts but nobody getting mobbed. 

MJ just on a whole ass other planet.

I hope in the future we get to hear some of his and Prince’s unreleased music. Artists who were working with them throughout the years have said these two dudes were on some next level shit but they never wanted anything other than perfection released.

I feel like music as a whole lost a lot with MJ. It’s like if LeBron and Micheal Jordan just stopped or didn’t exist anymore. How fun would basketball be. I mean I don’t really follow anymore, but the Jordan days. Holly shit. Same thing. LeBron might be there or surpassed MJ in stats already but something about Jordan just made the game amazing.

I think even baseball when dudes were roided out to hell and we had those few summers everyone cared about baseball for the home run records. Michal Jackson seemed to be all the greatest sports, celebrity and musicians popularity in one.

If you or your family bought it, you were going to listen to all of it, probably multiple times. They were $7.50-$10/ piece back then, so comparable to $26-$30 today's price after inflation.

People got their music from the Radio, TV/ MTV (when they actually played music), or a Record/ Cassette that someone had purchased. That was basically it for the normal person.

Use a longer lens or get closer. You can get away with some pretty outrageous high ISO if you're somewhere close to filling the frame. If you're cropping in a lot the noise becomes way more prominent.

Get more light on the sensor, so make sure the aperture is wide open and try dropping your shutter speed as low as you dare, then go even lower. Take pot-shots, you will get many blurry shots, but hopefully a few sharp ones. Lean on stuff to help stabilise your body and the lens. If your camera has a quiet or silent shutter use that. Hold your breath and press the shutter slowly. After a while you will do this automatically without thinking. (This all goes out the window when shooting moving subjects btw, then you generally need a high shutter speed, however most small birds often stay still for a few seconds at a time.)

Use single point continuous focus and most of the time you should aim for the eye or the edge of the eye. I'd recommend back-button focusing as well if you're not already using it.

Ideally you're shooting RAW and using lightroom or similar, dial in just enough ""colour noise reduction"" so that the coloured blotches disappear and leave luminance noise reduction at zero (really). Then add sharpening - again not too much it's easy to overdo. If you're feeling really fancy you can export to photoshop unsharpened, then resize to whatever screen resolution it will be displayed at, then duplicate layer and add unsharp mask, then add a layer mask and paint it so that *only the areas which have detail are sharpened*.",1647377919.0,3

Normally I shoot in situations where I don’t need to increase the ISO but it’s something I’ve been trying to figure out so I can add it to my arsenal when I’m doing shoots. 

I have a Sony a7ii and a 100mm g master lens that I really like but do to the tinted apodization lens that smooths out the bokeh it’s hard to use in suboptimal lighting conditions. Even thought it’s an f2.8 the light transmission is equal to an f5.6 lens. With my other shorter lenses I don’t have an issue getting enough light.

To make cigarettes on the other hand, you need a lot of space, water, and sun to grow, it has to be cured in large barns, it doesn't grow in all climates, the plants are massive, and to create a good blend you typically want to source your tobacco from different farms, as a slight difference in soil will completely change the flavor.

The black market for tobacco products exists because addicts don't want to pay taxes, and no one who doesn't already smoke gives a single shit about it.  No one who doesn't smoke is going to go up to a dealer and be like ""ya know I wanna try nic fits and not being able to breathe. Maybe give lung cancer a go. Got any of tobacckay?""

It's also worth remembering that Tobacco companies spend an absolute shit load of money trying to sell tobacco on image, not it's effects, in order to get people to start. And even with all that coordinated effort they're failing. No black market can do that or even wants to do that. It's way way less effort to just poach existing customers on the promise of no taxes, and even if the age limit for tobacco keeps increasing year by year, that's not a problem for the black market for 30 to 40 years, which means it wont have any pressure to change that method of operation.",1647386865.0,1

Tobacco is tough to grow. You need the absolute perfect nutrient balance in your soil, lots of land, lots of water, and lots of sun. Some tobacco is even grown under a massive cheesecloth that covers the whole field. The plants themselves are massive and take tons of manual labor to help them grow properly. Once harvested, it needs to cure in a large barn with carefully controlled humidity and temperature. Then it needs to be fermented in pylons that need to be monitored and manually rotated when the inner temperature gets too high. Then for cigarette tobacco, you need to ribbon cut it, and it generally needs additives to be pleasant to inhale.  

It's just not practical to grow indoors like weed, and the whole process takes so much more time and manual labor. All this for not even getting all that high when you smoke it, unless you smoke the real strong shit that usually comes with nausea and headaches",1647385905.0,1

You can’t just look at per-capita alcohol consumption to see reductions in problem-drinking, as drinking as a whole was not constant along demographic lines before prohibition, where alcoholism was massively more of an issue among men than women. Other experts have reported drops in drinking even in the later stages of prohibition:

“Prohibition meant to address these problems by reducing drinking. On that metric alone, it succeeded.

This is not controversial among experts. When I asked Courtwright, a drug historian at the University of North Florida, whether Prohibition led to more drinking, he responded, “No well-informed historian has believed that for 50 years.”

Courtwright’s The Age of Addiction has the statistics: “Per capita consumption initially fell to 30 percent of pre-Prohibition levels, before gradually increasing to 60 or 70 percent by 1933.” That suggests a 30 percent reduction, at a minimum, in consumption — although that was less than the initial effect, as people figured some ways around the law.”",1647388134.0,1

We don't even do this for most of the oldest and trustiest of NATO states. Putting nuclear armaments into a state that's clearly as compromised by Russia as Ukraine, that shares an incredibly insecure border with Russia and other hostile states that absolutely cannot be protected, would be massively foolhardy. 

On top of that, Ukraine having nuclear armaments wouldn't have deterred Russia in the slightest. Because just like the US, Russia has a first strike doctrine for the use of tactical nuclear weapons. And every expert on Russia and Putin that exists has made it very clear that Putin has absolutely no fear whatsoever of getting into a nuclear exchange. If we thought there was any possibility he was bluffing, we would have called his bluff and moved in immediately. 

He's not bluffing. He's itching to prove that Russia has the will to wield nuclear weapons. He's itching to show how strong Russia is. 

And if the US had nuclear weapons programs in Ukraine, don't you think they would have done a better job of hiding them? Do you think we would have let Russia invade Ukraine if we had bioweapon labs, and nuclear weapons programs laying around that would lead right back to us?

If you just apply the slightest amount of critical thinking, pretty much every Russian narrative collapses. 

This is just more bs out of the Russian bs factory. These motherfuckers blow more smoke than the fucking industrial revolution. They will do and say anything to justify their actions.

Or, like, cancelling a tender for Caracal helicopters without rhyme or reason, and then the Polish foreign minister claiming that the French should shut up because Poles taught them how to eat with forks?

Or getting into a years-long dispute with the EU regarding rule of law in Poland, which the ruling party is currently dismantling (their stacked Constitutional Court just decided that the Human Rights Convention is incompatible with Polish laws, so they aren't going to care about the article that talks about fair trial…)?

Or ceaselessly demanding war reparations from Germany, even though the Polish government gave them up (under Soviet pressure, but still) after the war?

Or basically becoming Orbán's best buddy, obstructing everything that the EU does?

Or promoting coal during the Conference of the Parties hosted in Poland? (for which they got an anti-award, I believe)

again I am really high.   


 First we got to remember that secret service would absolutely try to block that from happening.    Who would (past President or candidates) tell secret services to fuck off.  And who would actually do it?

I am not a fan of republicans (see previous comments). So here's my high ass thoughts, disregard any sort of comments on giving props to either side (going backwards in time).  

Trump, no fuckin way it happens.   
Hrc, same, not gonna happen.   
Obama, maybe tell ss to get fucked, but I don't think he's going to an active war zone.   
Sanders?  Same as Obama.  
maybe Bush 2 would tell ss to fuck off.  Probably wouldn't go tho as well.  Same with Clinton and Bush 1.    Reagan was mental so absolutely wouldn't do it.  Carter?  Carter would show up but wouldn't go against secret service.  Yada Yada...  I am thinking that the last president that would have done it given the chance (given they were in modern times) would have been maybe Teddie.  Theodore Roosevelt would have probably said ""fuck this asshole"" and done it lmao.

The PM is just the person in the majority party (or coalition) that they wanted to lead. They're just another representative.

Think, ""The democrats are in power, and Nancy Pelosi is the ""head"" of the democratic party, so she gets to be PM"". If she's killed, then that's bad, but thats only 1 representative, and theyll be replaced quickly.

President's Office should not have requested flight to an airport that was legally closed and not ready to accept such flights.

Holy shit… where do I even start?

His head of staff Yermak has (had?) close ties to Russian business and Kyiv shady business. He’s been filling their ranks with likewise awful people, E.g. Tatarov, an ex police guy who could be the symbol of police corruption, and his duty in Z office is controlling all of the law enforcement structures *via any means necessary* (read: corruption and threats via a network of personal connections and Z backing him up). NABU has a case against him and a few other people, we’re talking some ₴70M charges, against a guy taking care of law enforcement for the president…

Talking of nabu (national anti corruption agency) and SAP (specialised anti corruption attorney office) - they’re fucking hated by old and new guard alike, because those guys are not fucking around. NABU head's contract was meant to expire somewhere around now, and there’s a due process of selection a new one involving 3 committees from our government and 3 from international community. International guys were pushing for the best candidates, while our guys were pushing for the one controlled by Tatarov, dragging the process on every corner as hard as they could. It started over a year ago, the winner (a good guy) was clear last August, but they still haven’t approved the results under straight up imaginary / false pretences that have nothing to do with actual laws. Note that Z has personally and multiple times pledged to grandpa Biden that this process will be finished asap, for months on end, and it wasn’t finished.

Same process is meant to start for SAP, and they’re already doing the same fucking shenanigans.

Head attorney is a straight up evil woman with connotations of ussr/tsar times, and with her rhetoric she’d be a better fit for Russian law enforcement, but she does the dirty work for Z, so her own pace is secure.

There’s a “court” in Kyiv - OASK - that by law is the only institution that can take cases involving in any capacity any state state institutions. There’s just too much dirt about it to put into a single post, but just two things to paint a picture

- both Poroshenko and Z pledged to end it, both instead been using it for their advantage; Z's law draft to remove it been sitting in Rada for over a year- while his party has a sole majority, something happening for the first time in Ukraine

- NABU leaked lots of shit from there, and one phrase I still remember, said by head of the court to Poroshenko's aide when the court took a decision favouring then-candidate Z: “lmao, have you ever had any doubts in our political prostitution? We’ve been waiting for a long time to strike you back”. Sigh…

Head of SBU is Z‘a childhood friend that has nothing to do with law enforcement until being given place of head of SBU. Do I even need to elaborate?

And finally, for the last two years, defence spendings were jeopardised due to incompetence, malice, and different priorities from Z - building roads and shit. Our budget for building roads was like x2 or x3 from the entire military spending on paper, much more in fact due to military money not always being utilised. Now we don’t have much anti air capabilities and the roads are destroyed anyway; never mind the press reports of 20-40% of the roads budget being stolen.

His party in parliament has a lot of questionable people or outright traitors to the country. Or had, to be fair, they’ve done some cleansing, but it’s hard to forget.

I think I can keep going for a while, and he’s been in politics for just 2,5 years.

———

That being said, I’m positively impressed by how he handles the situation, and societal consensus right now is to stand by our president and our army.

Zelenskyy committing war crimes would absolutely lose the support of the international community, while Putin doing it doesn’t lose the support of the people who have been fed his propaganda for decades. These things are not the same. There isn’t a huge group of hardcore ideological Zelenskyy supporters, he’s a circumstantial hero, not an ideological one, so any change of circumstance would naturally change how people feel about him. Case in point, everyone here on Reddit loving him, but not siding with his pleas for a no-fly zone. People are also unafraid to talk about his prior policies and how he wasn’t a universally beloved president prior to the war. Zelenskyy is a heroic character right now, but he’s not worshipped the way Putin is by his supporters. 

And the story absolutely matters, it has always mattered. The story is how we find our way into or out of many of our armed conflicts. Vietnam was essentially tanked by bad press, while the war on terror was supported by good press. Shaping the narrative is a crucial aspect of modern warfare, both for domestic and international audiences. It’s why the U.S. “gets away with” many if its own war crimes and atrocities that hardly get any actual news coverage in American media. For all its supposed propaganda capabilities, I’m surprised Russia isn’t playing a successful narrative game with this war.

8892,worldnews,Polish PM says he has arrived in Kyiv,TR_2016,1647368258.0,839,8198,0.98,"That’s kinda literally what you’re doing though when you reduce it to “Russia’s side will believe Russia and Ukraine’s side will believe Ukraine.” These are not the same, because Russia has started an actual war and is lying constantly and consistently about it. Obviously Ukraine is going to want to present a narrative that’s in their favor, but the majority of what they’re saying is being actively checked by other intelligence agencies in addition to the actual evidence we are getting in the form of videos, pictures, eyewitness accounts, etc. There’s a lot of different and not necessarily collaborative governments and organizations reporting on what’s going on and overwhelmingly they’re seeing Ukraine’s “side” as being far more consistent with reality than Russia’s. So it’s not really an equal situation where a “both sides” argument applies. At worst, Ukraine is exaggerating. At best, Russia is deeply deluded. 

Like of course we wouldn’t trust Russian sources, they’re proven liars to an extreme degree. Of course they could sprinkle some truth in there, but their bias is obvious, it makes sense to distrust their perspective on a matter that directly involves them. If corroborated by other news sources then it becomes more believable, and people will adapt to the new information. 

Again, I really just don’t see these as equivalent. In the U.S. at the moment the overwhelming majority is in support of Ukraine, but there’s a range of opinions on what exactly to do to help. This isn’t the same as the much more uniform indoctrination we’re seeing as a result of Putin’s propaganda machine. No one in the U.S. is being jailed for not being pro-Ukraine or expressing ambiguity or indecisiveness in who they support or how.

The parts of the movie where original scenes were added, like the cow, or the 1 boob woman, were too much. Trying too hard and too cheesy. The re-dubbed bits totally make up for that though.

I watched a video about Asian made films gaining mainstream popularity in the west, and western studios starting to cater to the Chinese market.

These films are obviously going to have little international appeal.

Kung Pow though, it's just a dumb comedy riff on wuxia kung-fu, which many older Americans have memories of watching on public access. I think that person is looking too deep into this. It's also 20 years old.",1647375574.0,1

While I do think there are some animated movies that don't need a remaster (mainly most Disney movies from the golden era) I do think some deserve that treatment. Shrek is one of them.

Some classics were dealt rough hands, As you mentioned Toy Story, When the 3rd movie came out and it ""ended"" I thought it would be great if they remastered the 1st in the style of the 3rd. 

We've seen it in games, a remaster of an old classic with a modern update. Some movies deserve that treatment.

This virus is a new critter and behaving in different ways than what we've previously seen in common viruses. People talk about mortality and hospitalization as the major endpoints for consideration, but as many here have attested (and the study in question demonstrates), cognitive and emotional sequelae are prominent, even in “mild” cases.

Many key limbic and paralimbic structures are affected with COVID: orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate, temporal pole, insula, and amygdala. If this bears out, it is no surprise whatsoever that people are experiencing increased anxiety, depression, and worse. Those structures are directly related to emotion and regulation of emotion.

Everyone here is writing other factors that may contribute to depression. But COVID-triggered depression is weird or, better stated, different on it own. I have had depression from external and internal factors, and fighting to not go any further with my new covid-triggered depression. The big difference between both is that, and this is anecdotal, the first one, it’s kinda just degenerating state over time that you can back track from traumatic events, but covid-triggered is way different it is like you are one person and then just like that you are grey (to me it took just about 1 week to descend into a depressed state) it just happens. 

I had a not severe, mostly asymptomatic case. But one of my doctor’s colleagues committed suicide after a two week severe case, recovering and months of treatment for depression (at the moment diagnosed as PTSD).

It's a catch all in the sense that the ICU environment in and of itself is linked to delirium (aka icu psychosis) and symptoms can vary from one patient to the next but often have underlying characteristics.  Also to be fair delirium or psychosis can happen in non-icu units and really is better termed hospital associated delirium, but I digress. 

Some of the known factors contributing to the development of ICU delirium include disruptions of the sleep/wake cycle and poor quality sleep/non-REM sleep when the patient can sleep at all, side effects of medications, and constant state of stimulus including beeping, alarms, lights, staff interruptions, etc which keep the brain in a state of constant vigilance and eventually lead to disorientation. Throw in whatever illness, trauma, infection, or disease that's got somebody in the hospital and it's a recipe for altered mentation.

Also delirium comes in hypoactive and hyperactive forms, and a mixed form where behaviors can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Hypoactive delirium may cause lethargy, drowsiness, disorientation, slowed speech/movements, weakness, flat or withdrawn affect... Hyperactive delirium causes agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, personality changes, severe insomnia...

If you have a loved one in the hospital there are some things you can do to help prevent delirium! If you visit, try to keep blinds open and lights on during the day, lights dimmed at night, try to reduce nighttime interruptions and allow as much sleep as possible at night. Bring in any assostive devices such as hearing aids, dentures, and eyeglasses. Reorient your loved one to what day of the week it is, what holiday might be coming up, what's going on in the world, because all those things easily get lost track of when delirium starts setting in. From a healthcare perspective, providers should try to limit psychoactive and sedative and anticholinergic medications as much as possible, and try to reduce interruptions to sleep and lower/eliminate alarms/machines wherever possible.  

ICU delirium significantly contributes to injuries in the hospital setting and increased length of hospitalization and can result in PTSD, depression, and personality and/or memory changes that persist after the hospitalization is over and delirium has resolved.",1647360852.0,87

That was one of the strangest parts, and one thing I haven’t been able to understand. Why did I remember certain things and not others while I was under? It wasn’t that my sedation was lower at that point. 

The article doesn’t cover this, but there was another memory I have from that time. I was on the hospital bed being rushed through the hospital somewhere. My eyes were just slightly open so I could see everything going on. I remember I was drenched in sweat (apparently my fever had peaked at over 104 at this point and they had begun placing freezing blankets over me to try to lower my temperature). They had taken me off the vent for this, or maybe it occurred immediately after I was first knocked out and as they were moving me to be ventilated? Anyway, I was off oxygen. I remember several health care workers above me working on me, but they forgot to connect me to oxygen. I was paralyzed and I couldn’t breathe. I wasn’t even having those tight contractions you feel when you hold your breath because my entire body was paralyzed. I was frantic because I couldn’t call out to anyone to tell them to give me oxygen. After about a minute and a half, somebody finally noticed and hand-pumped some oxygen to me. I recall shortly thereafter that somebody was reading my charts and asked why I wasn’t on oxygen for that minute-plus time period. 

Similar to the death experience, why did I remember this? Was it because I was close to death due to oxygen deprivation, so my brain kicked into high gear and remembered it? I’ve spoken with several doctors, and nobody really knows. It’s crazy what the brain is able to do - or block out.",1647383891.0,4

10501,science,"Severe COVID-19 may lead to depression or anxiety, study finds",wawwuly,1647344563.0,861,16906,0.86,"I've suffered from this off and in my entire youth / young adult life, and ""mindfullnes"" practice has given me the tools to catch this unhelpful pattern before I get too consumed by it.

Say what you will about some of the terminology used in this description of the ""pain body"" which really resonates with me, but in my experience, this has been useful.

A tl;dr version could be: hurt people hurt people (including themselves)

Or: misery loves company.

""
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, “become you,” and live through you. It needs to get its “food” through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible. 

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn’t really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane. 

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don’t face it, if you don’t bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn’t make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth — that is, make it real in your own experience. 

So the pain-body doesn’t want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength.""",1647367015.0,7

I think it is really interesting: and here's why:

My wife's a fan of those food-porn shows on Netflix.  Heck, I'll enjoy them too.  And when you see a piece of BBQ pork belly glistening on the screen it is completely possible for you to go out and have a bite of that and it be exactly as good as it looks on tv.  

Real porn on the other hand presents something to its audience that you really wouldn't enjoy doing in real life even if your partner wanted to.  The discomfort, the physicality required, the kinds of touches.  Isn't this something where, once you have actually had sex a few times, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of it?

To circle back to food porn.  If one of the most common types of food-porn was steaks getting just absolutely crusted in salt and then deep fried into being nearly jerky, that might look good visually, but when you go out and eat it you'd say, ""wow... that sucks, what a disappointment.""

But I don't think the bad experience would impact people's overall satisfaction levels or lower their self-esteem.  Isn't it just manifestly obvious, once you're actually having sex, that things simply do not work the way they are depicted in porn?  To me this study says that people are identifying with porn much more deeply than I would have anticipated, and their identification is resistant to change in the face of direct, contradictory, evidence.

As a follow up thing I wonder if this might be because there are issues where people's weight and fitness levels make them think that if they were only in better shape they could do/enjoy those things, and so it kind of hits them there?",1647357144.0,16

Everything you do during sex matters: the way you look at them, the way you kiss them, the way you touch them, the pressure, location, timing, meaning, breathing, intensity, sound etc. It's about anticipation, power, connection, desire, passion, tension and release. It should be finely crafted like a good drama. There's so much available to you to control if you put in the attention and effort.

So I’m not shocked the 80s found nothing wrong with stalking as a whole. 

The other thing is that they write women as one dimensional irrational tools for the story. “It’s not what it looks like!” As a 2 hour long explanation of how to prove to their wife that “it’s not what it seems” because women are irrational and can’t be talked to. 

I never watched romcoms as a young teen because I didn’t like the plots. Now as an adult, I understand why I didn’t like the plots. 

Raunchy comedy has the same issue. Superbad literally pioneered consent in film. I remember Comedy Central playing a comedy where a man was raped while sleeping by a woman and his girlfriend walks in, and assumes he’s cheating on her. He was literally blacked out drunk and was raped on screen and this was “comedy”. No wonder so many millennial men hate women and can’t figure out how to date them, when their formative teenage years was filled with this trash or anime. Neither of which are particularly great at displaying that women are humans.

While this movie was popular, a friend of mine was raped at a party by a woman and nothing became of it because legally no one cared and socially no one saw it as rape. I can’t help but wonder why this is even an option when someone reports sexual assault, in the same way I wonder why so many men think stalking is a way to win a woman back.

The development of technologies to slow climate change has been identified as a global imperative. Nonetheless, such ‘green’ technologies can potentially have negative impacts on biodiversity. We explored how climate change and the mining of lithium for green technologies influence surface water availability, primary productivity and the abundance of three threatened and economically important flamingo species in the ‘Lithium Triangle’ of the Chilean Andes. We combined climate and primary productivity data with remotely sensed measures of surface water levels and a 30-year dataset on flamingo abundance using structural equation modelling. We found that, regionally, flamingo abundance fluctuated dramatically from year-to-year in response to variation in surface water levels and primary productivity but did not exhibit any temporal trends. Locally, in the Salar de Atacama—where lithium mining is focused—we found that mining was negatively correlated with the abundance of two of the three flamingo species. These results suggest continued increases in lithium mining and declines in surface water could soon have dramatic effects on flamingo abundance across their range. Efforts to slow the expansion of mining and the impacts of climate change are, therefore, urgently needed to benefit local biodiversity and the local human economy that depends on it.

Findings  In this cohort study of 29 621 adults, being overweight and having classes I and II obesity compared with having a normal BMI at a mean age of 40 years were associated with a statistically significantly higher cumulative morbidity score and health care costs across older adulthood. Age at death was similar in the overweight and statistically significantly younger in the classes I and II obesity group compared with the normal BMI group.

Meaning  This study’s findings suggest that overweight status beginning in midlife is associated with long-term adverse health and economic consequences in the context of similar longevity.

Importance  Abundant evidence links obesity with adverse health consequences. However, controversies persist regarding whether overweight status compared with normal body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is associated with longer survival and whether this occurs at the expense of greater long-term morbidity and health care expenditures.",1647363130.0,10

It's worth noting the most meaningful metric to look at from a societal standpoint is likely lifetime healthcare costs, and those **don't** increase significantly due to obesity, and are offset by savings from other programs, due to the morbid fact that unhealthy people don't live as long. 

The UK recently did a study and they found that from the three biggest healthcare risks; [obesity](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Smoking-and-the-Public-Purse.pdf&settings=111111011&lang=en-GB#page=&zoom=75&pagemode=), [smoking](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Obesity-and-the-Public-Purse-PDF.pdf&settings=111111011&lang=en-GB#page=&zoom=75&pagemode=
), and [alcohol](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DP_Alcohol%20and%20the%20public%20purse_63_amended2_web.pdf&settings=111111011&lang=en-GB#page=&zoom=75&pagemode=), they realize a net **savings** of £22.8 billion (£342/$474 per person) per year. This is due primarily to people with health risks not living as long (healthcare for the elderly is exceptionally expensive), as well as reduced spending on pensions, income from sin taxes, etc.. 

None of this really makes much difference though. Because, to the extent these things *do* create more healthcare spending, we're already paying for it at a higher rate with private insurance and current taxes.

In the US there are 106.4 million people that are overweight, at an additional lifetime healthcare cost of $3,770 per person average. 98.2 million obese at an average additional lifetime cost of $17,795. 25.2 million morbidly obese, at an average additional lifetime cost of $22,619. With average lifetime healthcare costs of $879,125, obesity accounts for 0.99% of our total healthcare costs. 

https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1038/oby.2008.290

Here's another study, that actually found that lifetime healthcare for the obese are *lower* than for the healthy. 

>Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.

For further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers, despite higher obesity rates.

That was an awesome 2-hour programming block, Brisco County/X-Files. It was a shame that that pairing only lasted for 6 months or so. Then The X-Files exploded while Brisco County languished.

  
 I used to work at a graphic arts company and our shift was 2p-10p m-f.    
Eventually we changed to 2p-11p M-Thurs, and then 2p-6p Fri. Even  
 though I was usually home by 7pm Friday night, I still programmed the   
vcr to record Fox 7-9p. I would then re-watch both shows a few times   
over the weekend, my brother got hooked on Brisco County, and my   
girlfriend at the time loved The X-Files.

 Even though we parted ways years later, we still remained friends (and still are) and she would occasionally still come over to watch The X-Files until Robert Patrick   
took over and our interest started to wane.",1647359676.0,5

Sam could just show up in a scene, crack wise or do a few cool things, and then fuck off back to drinking mojitos and chasing cougars.

I'm not sure if the character would have worked well in the lead. The movie they did was good enough, but weekly plots where Sam has to pull the weight of the narrative every time? Half the character's charm is that he scarcely ever gives a shit and is game for hijinks basically whenever, but a lead character has to be more invested than that.

Sam Axe has a constant ""I just wanna' go home"" energy whenever he's the focus of the plot, which is fantastic in short bursts, but wouldn't hold up to scrutiny in a spinoff where he's the perpetual focus. Character would have to change a lot to support it. 

Otherwise the viewer would constantly be asking ""why the hell is he even doing all this right now?"" else the writers would have to give increasingly flimsy excuses why his character isn't just fucking off and going home. In Burn Notice, he was always in the game for Mike and Fi or one of his buddies' sakes in a ""Sam's Buddy"" episode. He was always game to help people out, but he was rarely the one *seeking out the needy* and, in the absence of Mike's magnetic hero reputation, wouldn't be going out looking for wrongs to right. And the obvious answers, like ""Sam has money troubles and has to take jobs to pay for his new car or something"" makes him seem less sympathetic than his previous ""Sam is flawed but supremely loyal and good-hearted"" portrayal in Burn Notice.

He's too much of a ""minds his own business"" type to get into adventures without other characters like Michael or his cavalcade of buddies dragging him into the weekly shenanigans. And a ""Sam's buddy is in trouble every week"" formula wouldn't last very long, unless you focused an entire season on one single ""case"" and one well-characterized and developed long-term buddy. You'd need either a radically different weekly formula, or some inciting incident that turns Sam into more of the weekly-hero type (and an incident of that nature would run the risk of stomping all over the lightheartedness of the character, since ""they killed my wife and now I want revenge!"" or the like would ruin the ""fun"" of the character.)",1647362283.0,8

The network also pushed for more interpersonal conflict and the cromags as a 'big bad guy'. They drove the professor out & replaced him with a playboy playmate.

So the only explanation has to be that the legislature didn't find it prudent to resubmit it. Maybe the Governor had some other political capital that made it not politically smart, like an upcoming state of the state where he'd have a bigger platform? maybe legislative action moved slower then and in the intermediate time before an override session, the popular sentiment or lobbying had shifted to be more pro-automobile?
